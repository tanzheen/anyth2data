*New Studies in Biblical Theology* is a series of monographs that
address key issues in the discipline of biblical theology. Contributions
to the series focus on one or more of three areas: 1. the nature and
status of biblical theology, including its relations with other
disciplines (e.g. historical theology, exegesis, systematic theology,
historical criticism, narrative theology); 2. the articulation and
exposition of the structure of thought of a particular biblical writer
or corpus; and 3. the delineation of a biblical theme across all or part
of the biblical corpora.

Above all, these monographs are creative attempts to help thinking
Christians understand their Bibles better. The series aims
simultaneously to instruct and to edify, to interact with the current
literature, and to point the way ahead. In God's universe, mind and
heart should not be divorced: in this series we will try not to separate
what God has joined together. While the notes interact with the best of
the scholarly literature, the text is uncluttered with untransliterated
Greek and Hebrew, and tries to avoid too much technical jargon. The
volumes are written within the framework of confessional evangelicalism,
but there is always an attempt at thoughtful engagement with the sweep
of the relevant literature.

Of the three approaches to biblical theology listed above, this volume
follows the third. Dr Greg Beale traces out the theme of the
tabernacle/temple across the Bible's story-line, illuminating text after
text as he goes. But more, he shows that the significance and symbolism
of the temple draw on cultural assumptions, with the result that his
theology is well grounded not only in exegesis but also in history. And
beyond that, he ventures some suggestions about the meaning of the
temple in both the Old and the New Testaments that break new ground,
enabling thoughtful readers to perceive connections in the text of
Scripture that doubtless escaped them in the past. The importance of
this book therefore lies not only in the competent handling
[]{#pre3.html#page_10}of its chosen theme, but also in three other
things: its evocative unpacking of the theme of the temple in its
relations to broader structures of thought, including the kingdom of
God; its modelling of the way biblical theology is to be done; and its
capacity to cause readers to perceive fresh and wonderful things in the
Scriptures, and bow in worship and gratitude.

This book had its birth as a three-page excursus to Revelation 22:1--2
in my commentary on Revelation (see Beale 1999a: 1109--1111). In 2001 I
expanded the excursus into an extended paper, which was read at the
Tyndale Fellowship Study Group on Biblical Theology in Cambridge,
England (whose topic was on 'The Biblical Theology of the Temple'). The
paper, along with other papers at that conference, was subsequently
published (see Beale 2004). I am thankful to the conveners of the
Tyndale Study Group for giving me opportunity to deliver this paper and
for including it in the published volume of papers from the conference.

The extended paper was still only the barest thumb-nail sketch of what I
had in mind as a biblical theology of the temple. Therefore, I set out
to write a fuller-scale work. I have discovered that some of the book's
chapters themselves need even further elaboration, but one has to stop
somewhere.

This book has been the most exciting research project on which I have
ever worked. It has opened my eyes to themes that I had seen only dimly
before. In particular, I have seen more clearly than ever that the
themes of Eden, the temple, God's glorious presence, new creation and
the mission of the church are ultimately facets of the same reality! It
is my hope that the biblical-theological perspective of this book will
provide greater fuel to fire the church's motivation to fulfil its
mission to the world.

I am indebted beyond words to my wife, Dorinda, who has discussed the
theology of the temple with me for the past couple of years, and who
remains as excited as I am about the subject. She has been one of the
main instruments through which I have been able to understand this topic
in more depth.

I also owe a great debt to Don Carson, the editor of this series. Don
made a significant investment in reading and carefully evaluating the
manuscript. His suggestions for revision were invaluable and have
definitely made this a better book than it would have been! In
[]{#pre4.html#page_12}addition, his encouragement about the project's
viability throughout the editorial process has motivated me to finish
it. Along with Don Carson, I must mention Philip Duce, Theological Books
Editor at IVP in England, who has also read the manuscript and offered
suggestions for improvement and encouragement. I am thankful to both Don
and Philip for accepting this book for publication. I am similarly
indebted to Jeff Niehaus, Gordon Hugenberger, Dan Master, John Monson
and John Walton for reading and commenting on parts of this book, as
well as alerting me to some OT and ANE sources.

I am likewise grateful to College Church (in Wheaton), which asked me to
deliver the Fall 2001 Missions Sunday sermon on the subject of this book
(and invited me to teach in other venues in the church on the theme).
Attempting to distil the material for the church community has been
essential in helping me to understand it even better. In addition, being
able to teach the subject at Park Woods Presbyterian Church (Kansas
City), Wheaton College Graduate School, The Greek Bible School of Athens
(Greece), the Evangelical Theological College of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)
and the Bethlehem Theological Institute (Minneapolis) has been an
enormous benefit, especially with respect to student questions that have
sharpened my perspectives.

I also want to offer appreciation to the following research students who
either helped do research or double-checked and edited the manuscript of
this book: John Kohler, Ben Gladd, Stephen Webster, Kevin Cawley
(particularly his research in early Judaism) and Todd Wilson. I am
especially indebted to Greg Goss for his stylistic comments and other
suggestions to improve the clarity of the book. Thanks must also be
given to David Lincicum for creating the indices for the book.

Above all, I am thankful to God for enabling me to conceive the idea for
this book and giving me the energy and discipline to write it. It is my
prayer that God's glory will more greatly be manifested as a result of
the reading of this book.

A few comments about some stylistic aspects of the book are in order.
English translations follow the New American Standard Bible, unless
otherwise indicated or, when different, represent my own translation.
With respect to all translations of ancient works, when the translation
differs from the standard editions usually referred to, then it is my
translation or someone else's (in the latter case I indicate whom).

[]{#pre4.html#page_13}References to the Greek New Testament are from the
NA^27^. In making references to the Septuagint, I refer to the Greek
text of *The Septuagint Version of the Old Testament and Apocrypha with
an English Translation*, which is dependent on Codex B. This will enable
those not knowing Greek to follow the Septuagint in a readily available
English edition. Occasionally, reference is made to A. Rahlfs (ed.),
*Septuaginta*, which is the standard eclectic text for the Septuagint.

My references to the Dead Sea Scrolls come primarily from A.
Dupont-Sommer, *The Essene Writings from Qumran*; reference to more
recently published materials comes from the new edition of F. G.
Martínez, *The Dead Sea Scrolls Translated*, and sometimes reference is
made to F. G. Martínez and E. J. C. Tigchelaar (eds.), *The Dead Sea
Scrolls Study Edition*. In addition, other translations of DSS were
consulted and, sometimes, preferred in quotations, though at other times
variations from Dupont-Sommer or Martínez are due to the author's own
translation.

The primary sources of various Jewish works were ordinarily referred to,
and sometimes quoted, in the following English editions: I. Epstein

Have you ever wondered about some of the people described in the Bible?
Some of them frankly seem superhuman, not quite real. For example, it
seems odd that Paul and Silas sang in prison. Would I sing if I were in
prison? Would I have the attitude expressed in Hebrews 10:34, where it
portrays Christians as accepting 'joyfully' the seizure of their
property? Would I be joyful if the authorities came and seized my house?
In Acts 5:40--41, it says they flogged the apostles and told them not to
speak in the name of Jesus any more. Their response is not what I
consider a 'normal' reaction. They went away rejoicing because 'they had
been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name'.

Would I rejoice if I suffered shame and was beaten? Why is their
response so different? How can they act so totally different from most
of us? It is as though their reality was different or they were seeing
things that the natural eye cannot see. In 2 Kings 6, Elisha prays for
his servant. The two men are surrounded by the army of Syria. The
servant of Elisha is, naturally, distressed. Elisha comforts him with
these words: 'Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those
who are with them' (v. 16). I have never been very good at arithmetic,
but I do know that a Syrian army outnumbers two men! Elisha then prays
that God would open his servant's eyes. We discover that the servant
'sees' 'the mountain \[is\] full of horses and chariots of fire all
around'. What happened? He was given eyes to see true reality!

What is this true reality that can so alter all that we say and do? When
one becomes a Christian, real truth is seen. True reality is the fact
that humanity is drowning in a sea of sin with no way to save itself.
The only hope is to cry out to God. Only Jesus, the Messiah, can save.
If you cling to him as your Saviour, you will not be carried away in the
sea of sin because he is the rock of our salvation (Acts 4:10--12).

Second Corinthians 5:17 says, 'if any man is in Christ, he is a new
creature; the old things have passed away; behold, new things have
come'. How is this 'newness' of life as a Christian manifested? It seems
[]{#pre5.html#page_16}as though Nicodemus's question to Jesus is
understandable: 'how can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a
second time into his mother's womb' (John 3:4). Jesus answers this
perplexing question in verse 6, 'That which is born of the flesh is
flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.' The significance
seems to be that the Spirit is different. It is not at all like the
flesh. So, how can we still remain in our fleshly bodies and yet 'walk'
in 'newness of life' (Rom. 6:4)? First Peter 2:11 tells us that we are
'aliens and strangers' on earth, which means earth is not our home.
Instead, Ephesians 2:19--22 explains, our home is in heaven, and we are
*now '*of God's household' (see also 1 Tim. 3:15). How can we really be
part of God's household *now*? We live on earth. Are we not just in a
'holding pattern' until we actually die or the world ends? Aren't we
only looking forward to the future time when we will be part of 'God's
household'?

Since Scripture tells us that we are *now* part of God's household and
are not just wandering around as 'aliens' on earth, where is God's
household, who is there, and what difference does it make anyway?
Hebrews 12:22--24 explains very clearly where we are and who is there
with us:

::: cita
But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly,
and the church of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to God,
the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, and
Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which
speaks better than the blood of Abel.
:::

When we, like Elisha's servant, have our eyes of faith opened, the
awesome fact is that we are in the presence of God, and Jesus the
mediator of a new covenant. 'He delivered us from the domain of
darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son'
(Col. 1:13). We are there now. Christians are 'living stones', 'being
built up as a spiritual house' (1 Pet. 2:5).

When my oldest daughter Nancy was three years old, our family lived in
England. In the spring of that year, Nancy and I were invited to a
picnic at a very large country estate. As we walked around the house and
grounds, I realized that she was hardly fazed by the splendour and
beauty of this magnificent estate. I pulled her aside and said, 'Nancy,
I know you are very young, but this is a special place. Try to remember
this day.'

[]{#pre5.html#page_17}We, like my daughter, need to be pulled aside and
told that we are in the most special place of all -- *now* -- God's
palatial mountain-temple.

This book will explain in detail where we are and the beauty and
splendour of the new Jerusalem, the temple of the living God. Israel's
physical temple which was seen by the naked eye was a mere shadow of the
heavenly reality (Heb. 9:24)! May God open our eyes to understand:

To dwell in Thy courts.

Thy holy temple.

## The final vision of the Apocalypse and its implications for a biblical theology of the temple {.int_niv1}

Revelation 21:1 -- 22:5 contains the well-known and much discussed final
vision of the entire Bible. There is, however, a major problem that has
barely been noticed. Why does John see 'a new heaven and a new earth' in
Revelation 21:1 and yet in 21:2--3, 10 -- 22:3 he sees a city that is
garden-like, in the shape of a temple? Why does John not see a full
panorama of the new heavens and earth? Why does he not see the many
forests, rivers, mountains, streams, valleys and the many other features
of a fertile worldwide new creation. Some might attribute the apparent
discrepancy to the irrational nature that ancient apocalyptic visions
and dreams could have, though this would be hard to accept for a vision
that John claims has its origin in God (cf. 21:9 with Rev. 1:1 and 22:6,
for example). Also, how does this vision relate to Christians and their
role in fulfilling the mission of the church, an issue with which John
has been absorbed throughout Revelation?

Thus, after initially saying that he saw 'a new heaven and a new earth',
John focuses only on an arboreal city-temple in the remainder of the
vision. The dimensions and architectural features of the city in these
verses are drawn to a significant extent from Ezekiel 40 -- 48, a
prophecy of the dimensions and architectural features of a future temple
(so vv. 2, 10--12; 21:27 -- 22:2). The precious stones forming the
foundation in Revelation 21:18--21 reflect the description of Solomon's
temple which also was overlaid with gold and whose foundation was
composed of precious stones: see respectively 1 Kings 6:20--22 (and
5:17) and 7:9--10, and note that the dimensions of Revelation 21:16
('its length and width and height are equal') are based on the
dimensions of the 'holy of holies' in 1 Kings 6:20 (where the 'length .
. . and the breadth . . . and the height' of the holy of holies were
equal in measurement).

[]{#chap1.html#page_24}How can one explain the apparent discrepancy that
John, in verse 1, saw a new creation, yet in the remainder of the vision
observed only a city in the shape and structure of a temple? It is
possible, of course, that he first sees the new world and then sees a
city-temple *in* that world. But this is not likely because it is
apparent that he equates the 'new heavens and earth' with the following
description of the 'city-temple'.

This equation of the new world with the city-temple becomes clearer when
one begins to reflect on Revelation 21:27, which declares that 'nothing
unclean . . . shall ever come into' the urban temple. In this respect,
it is significant to remember that in the Old Testament any uncleanness
was to be kept out of the temple precincts (e.g., 2 Chr. 23:19; 29:16;
30:1--20). That the perimeters of the new city-temple will encompass the
whole of the new creation is suggested then by the fact that Revelation
21:27 says that no uncleanness was allowed into this unusual temple.
This observation probably means that no uncleanness will be allowed into
the new world. The equation of the city-temple with the new world is
further evident from the exclusion of the unclean from the new city in
22:15, which means they will also be excluded from dwelling in the new
creation, since they will be in the lake of fire for ever (see ch. 10 in
this book).

Another observation points to the equation of the new cosmos with the
city-temple. Revelation 21:1 commences, as we have seen, with John's
vision of 'a new heaven and a new earth', followed by his vision of the
'new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven' (v. 2), after which he hears
a 'loud great voice' proclaiming that 'the tabernacle of God is among
men, and he shall dwell among them'. It is likely that the second vision
in verse 2 interprets the first vision of the new cosmos, and that what
is heard about the tabernacle in verse 3 interprets both verses 1 and 2.
If so, the new creation of verse 1 is identical to the 'new Jerusalem'
of verse 1 and both represent the same reality as the 'tabernacle' of
verse 3.

The 'seeing--hearing' pattern elsewhere in Revelation suggests that
verses 1--3 refer to the same reality. At other points in the book
either what John sees is interpreted by what he then hears or vice
versa. A good example is Revelation 5:5, where John *hears* about a
'Lion that is from the tribe of Judah' who 'conquered'. John *sees* a
slain lamb possessing sovereign authority in verse 6, which interprets
how the messianic lamb conquered: he won victory ironically by dying as
a 'slain lamb'.

That the 'new heaven and new earth' of 21:1 is defined by and
[]{#chap1.html#page_25}equated with the paradisal city-temple of 21:2
and 21:9 -- 22:5 is also supported by J. D. Levenson's observation that
'heaven and earth' in the Old Testament may sometimes be a way of
referring to Jerusalem or its temple, for which 'Jerusalem' is a
metonymy.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN1){#chap1.html#ap_NFIN1-1 .apnf} He
quotes Isaiah 65:17--18 in support: '*For behold, I create new heavens
and a new earth*;/And the former things shall not be remembered or come
to mind./'But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create;/*For behold,
I create Jerusalem* for rejoicing' (emphasis
mine).[2](#appen11.html#NFIN2){#chap1.html#ap_NFIN2-1 .apnf} These two
new-creation statements in these verses appear to be in a synonymously
parallel relationship. Since Isaiah 65:17 is alluded to in Revelation
21:1, it is most natural to understand that the new Jerusalem of 21:2 is
equated with the 'new heaven and earth' of 21:1. That the new creation
in verse 1 and new Jerusalem in verse 2 are interpreted in verse 3 to be
'the tabernacle of God' among all humanity, would also be a natural
equation, as Levenson noted above, and as we will see throughout this
book.

Consequently, the new creation and Jerusalem are none other than God's
tabernacle. This tabernacle is the true temple of God's special presence
portrayed throughout chapter 21.

As I have continued to reflect on the Apocalypse, and especially my
conclusion about the temple of Revelation 21, since the writing of my
commentary on Revelation (published in 1999), I have noticed even more
connections between the various temple texts in the Old and New
Testaments. My purpose in this book is to explore in more depth the
significance of the temple in John's Apocalypse and especially in this
final vision of the book. My beginning point is a brief answer to the
above question about why John equates the new creation with an arboreal
city-temple in his last vision of the book. I formulated a brief answer
to this in my Revelation commentary a few years
ago.[3](#appen11.html#NFIN3){#chap1.html#ap_NFIN3-1 .apnf}

In this book I will attempt to amplify the evidence adduced in support
of this answer in order to enhance its plausibility. My thesis is that
the Old Testament tabernacle and temples were symbolically designed to
point to the cosmic eschatological reality that God's tabernacling
presence, formerly limited to the holy of holies, was to be extended
throughout the whole earth. Against this background, the Revelation 21
vision is best understood as picturing the final end-time temple that
will fill the entire cosmos. If correct, the thesis provides
[]{#chap1.html#page_26}not only the answer to the above problem in
chapter 21, but also gives crucial insight into an understanding of the
biblical theology of the temple in both testaments.

In attempting to substantiate this thesis, I will survey the evidence
for the cosmic symbolism of Old Testament and Ancient Near Eastern
temples. Then I will argue that the Garden of Eden was the first
archetypal temple, and that it was the model for all subsequent temples.
Such an understanding of Eden will enhance the notion that the Old
Testament tabernacle and temples were symbolic microcosms of the whole
creation. As microcosmic symbolic structures they were designed to point
to a worldwide eschatological temple that perfectly reflects God's
glory. It is this universally expanded eschatological temple that is
pictured in Revelation's last vision. Other relevant passages about the
temple in the New Testament will be adduced in further support of this
contention.

## A brief comment on the interpretative approach of this book {.int_niv1}

An important presupposition underlying this study is the divine
inspiration of the entire Bible, both Old and New Testaments. This
foundational perspective means that there is unity to the Bible because
it is all God's word. Therefore, there is legitimacy in attempting to
trace common themes between the testaments. Though interpreters differ
about what are the most significant unifying themes, those who affirm
the ultimate divine authorship of Scripture have a common data-base with
which to discuss and debate.

Another important presupposition is that the divine authorial intentions
communicated through human authors are accessible to contemporary
readers. Though no-one can exhaustively comprehend these intentions,
they can be sufficiently understood, especially for the purposes of
salvation, sanctification and glorification of God. Of this subject,
especially as it bears on the subject of the book, we will speak more in
a concluding chapter (see ch. 12).

Finally, a typical strategy of argumentation throughout this book will
be to adduce several lines of evidence in favour of a particular
interpretation. Some of these lines will be stronger than others, but
when all of the relevant material is viewed as a whole, the less
convincing material should become more significant than when seen by
itself. Therefore, it will sometimes be true that some of the arguments
in favour of an interpretation will not stand on their own but are
[]{#chap1.html#page_27}intended to take on more persuasive power when
viewed in light of the other angles of reasoning. And, even when this
may not be the case, the design is that the overall weight of the
cumulative arguments points to the plausibility or probability of the
main idea being contended for.

# Cosmic symbolism of temples in the Old Testament {.chap_tit}

::: dev
Some of the best clues to solving the problem posed above about the
relation of the new creation to the city-temple of Revelation 21 are to
be found in the conception of Israel's temple. We will also look at the
symbolic meaning of other ancient temples to enhance the understanding
of Israel's sanctuary in the midst of its ancient environment. Though
these were pagan temples, it is not likely that their resemblances to
Israel's temple were due to coincidence or to Israel's mere dependence
on her pagan neighbours for religious ideas. Rather, this resemblance of
pagan temples to Israel's temple probably was due, at least in part, to
a refracted and marred understanding of the true conception of the
temple that was present from the very beginning of human history. As
history unfolded, God's special revelation about the temple continued
only with the faithful remnant of humanity. The recollection of the true
temple by those outside God's covenant community probably continued, but
its memory became dim over time. Nevertheless, refracted glimmers of
truth may have continued, so that some temples were designed that still
retained features corresponding to God's own
view.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN4){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN4-1 .apnf} God's
people, on the other hand, continued building temples that represented
the pristine view of the true
cult.[2](#appen11.html#NFIN5){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN5-1 .apnf} One could
say that just as God's image in unbelieving humanity has not been erased
but blurred, so their continuing conception of the structure where God
should be worshipped was likewise blurred.

Some commentators disagree that the design and symbolism of ancient
pagan temples reflected glimmers of God's truth. Even granting such a
view, however, it is apparent that Israel intentionally alluded to
facets of the pagan religion surrounding them (e.g., Egyptian, Canaanite
and Babylonian) in order to affirm that what the pagans thought was true
of their gods was true only of Israel's God
[]{#chap2.html#page_30}(e.g., Ps. 29 is a well-known example of applying
the sovereign attributes of the fertility god Baal to Yahweh in order to
demonstrate that only Yahweh possesses such characteristics). The same
polemical intention was likely part of Israel's depiction of their
temple. Hence, there is a sense in which Israel may have borrowed
religious notions and imagery from her neighbours, but it was for
polemical reasons and not for lack of religious creativity. That pagan
nations, however, could depict their gods with attributes like those of
the true God and their temples along the lines of the true God's
dwelling probably shows they had some sense of the true God, though
certainly in a non-salvific and confused form (as, e.g., in Rom.
1:19--25).

There is, at least, a third way in which pagan cultural ideas could have
been related to Israel and even her temple. Some of Israel's ideas were
merely shared with pagan peoples because they simply shared a general
common culture, though often when Israel employed the concept, it became
filled with theological significance. For example, it was likely a
widespread custom in the Ancient Near East that certain ceremonies
involving the donning of clothes or the removal or leaving of clothes
indicated respectively the acquisition of inheritance rights or
disinheritance. This may explain a whole host of passages involving
clothing in the Old Testament (and the New Testament): the divine
provision of clothing to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:21 appears to
indicate a gracious reaffirmation of their inheritance rights over
creation, despite their former
rebellion.[3](#appen11.html#NFIN6){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN6-1 .apnf} It is
possible that some kind of relationship like this may have existed
between the clothing of pagan and Israel's priests and even the
adornment of the respective temples.

With these possible relationships between the thought of the ancient
Israelites and the peoples surrounding them, we now turn primarily to a
study of Israel's temples. After looking at the Old Testament evidence,
reflection on Jewish interpretations of Israel's temple may also prove
helpful for understanding the Old Testament material. We will also
survey pertinent parallels in the Ancient Near East, where examination
of the sanctuaries of Israel's neighbours may also shed some light on
the subtle symbolism of the Israelite holy place.

Our study of ancient materials outside the Bible to gain a better
[]{#chap2.html#page_31}understanding of the temple does not mean that
this material is equal in authority to the Bible. Rather, it indicates
that the Bible was written in very specific historical circumstances and
the better one understands these surrounding circumstances, the more
rich one's understanding of the Bible may become. Christians often use
commentaries on the Bible in order to understand the biblical text
better. Sometimes such commentaries provide a perspective on a text,
which sheds new light and helps us to understand the text better. The
new perspective is validated over other previous ones because it makes
more sense of the details of the text. Sometimes, however, these
commentaries are clearly wrong and are not helpful, and, at other times,
these commentaries merely resummarize the biblical text, saying nothing
new nor wrong.

The documents of the Ancient Near East and of Judaism function
comparably to modern commentaries. Should we not also make use of this
ancient commentary material, for example early Jewish interpretations of
Old Testament texts, themes, and so on? Such Jewish commentary material
has the same potential use (and misuse) as do contemporary commentaries,
though they have the potential of picking up early oral interpretative
tradition that may stem from Old Testament times itself. We will see
that there may be some early Jewish interpretation of the temple that
sheds helpful light on the Old Testament notion of the temple. We will
propose the same thing for some Ancient Near Eastern views of temples.

Though the discussion of this chapter is rather detailed, it is
absolutely crucial to work through and understand it as a basis for the
later part of this book.

::: {#chap2.html#niv1-003 .niv1}
## The Old Testament view of Israel's earthly temple as a reflection of the heavenly or cosmic temple {.int_niv1}

The rationale for the worldwide encompassing nature of the paradisal
temple in Revelation 21 lies in the ancient notion that the Old
Testament temple was a microcosm of the entire heaven and
earth.[4](#appen11.html#NFIN7){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN7-1 .apnf} One of the
most explicit texts affirming this is Psalm 78:69: 'And He built His
sanctuary like the heights,/Like the earth which He has
[]{#chap2.html#page_32}founded *forever* (or from
eternity)'.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN8){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN8-1 .apnf} The
psalmist is saying that, in some way, God designed Israel's earthly
temple to be comparable to the heavens and to the earth. Similarly, the
earlier 'pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture'
was made 'after the \[heavenly\] pattern . . . which was shown . . . on
the mountain' (Exod. 25:9, 40; cf. Exod. 26:30; 27:8; Num. 8:4; Heb.
8:5; 9:23--24). The following study will attempt to demonstrate that the
symbolism of the tabernacle is essentially the same as that of Israel's
subsequent temple. This equivalence is implied by their many overt
similarities and by comparing Exodus 25:9, 40 with 1 Chronicles 28:19,
which say that both the plan of the tabernacle and of the temple came
from God.[6](#appen11.html#NFIN9){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN9-1 .apnf}

Jewish tradition, as we will see, also reaffirms the truth of Psalm 78
and Exodus 25, that the earthly temple corresponded in some significant
manner to the heavens, especially a heavenly
temple.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN10){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN10-1 .apnf} The
primary task of this chapter is to elaborate on how Israel's tabernacle
and temple were comparable in symbolic design to the heavens and earth.

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-001 .niv2}
### General symbolism of the temple {.int_niv2}

Our thesis is that Israel's temple was composed of three main parts,
each of which symbolized a major part of the cosmos: (1) the outer court
represented the habitable world where humanity dwelt; (2) the holy place
was emblematic of the visible heavens and its light sources; (3) the
holy of holies symbolized the invisible dimension of the
[]{#chap2.html#page_33}cosmos, where God and his heavenly hosts dwelt.
In this connection, M. Haran has observed an increasing gradation in
holiness beginning with the outer court and proceeding to the holy place
and then into the holy of holies. Furthermore, he notes that this
gradation corresponds to a gradation in dress and furnishings dependent
on the position of the person in the temple (respectively worshipper,
priest or high priest) or the location of the furnishings (curtains,
furniture, etc.).[8](#appen11.html#NFIN11){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN11-1
.apnf} This observation about increasing gradation indicating increasing
holiness may not be inconsistent with A. A. de Silva's view that Old
Testament temple-building narratives reflect a three-tiered structure
with God at the top, kings (and, I would add, priests) in the middle,
and Israel and the rest of the cosmos at the bottom (de Silva 1994:
11--23).

The identification of the outer court as the visible earth and sea is
suggested further by the Old Testament description, where the large
molten wash-basin and altar in the temple courtyard are called
respectively the 'sea' (1 Kgs. 7:23--26) and the 'bosom of the earth'
(Ezek. 43:14; the altar also likely was identified with the 'mountain of
God' in Ezek. 43:16).[9](#appen11.html#NFIN12){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN12-1
.apnf} The altar was also to be an 'altar of earth' (in the early stages
of Israel's history) or an 'altar of \[uncut\] stone' (Exod. 20:24--25),
thus identifying it even more with the natural
earth.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN13){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN13-1 .apnf} Thus
both the 'sea' and 'altar' appear to be cosmic symbols that may have
been associated in the mind of the Israelite respectively with the seas
and the earth[11](#appen11.html#NFIN14){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN14-1 .apnf}
(enhancing the water imagery were the []{#chap2.html#page_34}ten smaller
wash-basins, five on each side of the holy place enclosure \[1 Kgs.
7:38--39\]). The arrangement of the twelve bulls 'entirely encircling
the sea' and the 'lily blossom' decorating the brim would also seem to
present a partial miniature model of land and life surrounding the seas
of the earth (2 Chr. 4:2--5). The twelve bulls also supported the
wash-basin and were divided into groups of three, facing to the four
points of the compass, which could well reflect the four quadrants of
the earth (Levenson 1988: 92--93, and Levenson 1985: 139, 162). That
twelve oxen were pictured holding up the 'sea' and designs of lions and
oxen were on the wash-basin stands points further to an 'earthly'
identification of the outer courtyard (though cherubim were also
depicted on the basin stands). That the outer court was associated with
the visible earth is also intimated by recalling that all Israelites,
representing humanity at
large,[12](#appen11.html#NFIN15){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN15-1 .apnf} could
enter there and worship.

There is also reason to view the second section of the temple, the holy
place, to be a symbol of the visible sky. The seven lamps on the
lampstand may have been associated with the seven light-sources visible
to the naked eye (five planets, sun and moon). This identification is
pointed to by Genesis 1 which uses the unusual word 'lights' (*mě'ōrōt*,
5 times) instead of 'sun' and 'moon', a word that is used throughout the
remainder of the Pentateuch (10 times) only for the 'lights' on the
tabernacle lampstand. On the same basis, a contemporary commentator on
Genesis has made virtually the same observation and proposed that this
is the first hint also that the cosmos itself was conceived of as a huge
temple.[13](#appen11.html#NFIN16){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN16-1 .apnf} In
addition, John's Apocalypse []{#chap2.html#page_35}also closely
identifies the seven lamps on the lampstand with stars by saying that
each of the seven churches that are symbolized by a 'lampstand' are
represented in heaven by an 'angel' who is symbolized by a 'star' (Rev.
1:20) (Beale 1995a: 211--219).

Vern Poythress also contends along similar lines that the lamps signify
the seven main lights of the heaven:

::: cita
The lampstand is placed on the south side of the Holy Place. Perhaps
this placement is intended to correspond to the fact that from Israel's
point of view, north of the equator, the circuit of the heavenly lights
would be primarily to the south. That there are seven of the lamps
correlates not only with the seven major lights of heaven . . . but with
the general symbolism for time within Israel. The heavenly bodies were
made in order to 'serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years'
(Gen. 1:14). The whole cycle of time marked by the sun and moon and
stars is divided up into sevens: the seventh day in the week is the
Sabbath day; the seventh month is the month of atonement (Lev. 16:29);
the seventh year is the year of release from debts and slavery (Deut.
15); the seventh of the seven-year cycles is the year of jubilee (Lev.
25). Fittingly, the lampstand contains the same sevenfold division,
symbolizing the cycle of time provided by the heavenly lights.
(Poythress 1991: 18--19)
:::

That the holy of holies represented the unseen heavenly dimension of the
world is apparent from its descriptions. Just as the angelic cherubim
guard God's throne in the heavenly temple (e.g., Rev. 4:7--9), the
sculpted cherubim around the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies
(1 Kgs. 6:23--28), and the figures of the cherubim woven into the
curtain that guards the holy of holies reflects the real cherubim in
heaven who presently and in the future will stand guard around God's
throne in the heavenly temple (cf. 2 Sam. 6:2; 2 Kgs. 19:15; 1 Chr.
13:6; Pss. 80:1; 99:1, all of which may have double reference to the
earthly and heavenly cherubim). Furthermore, no human could enter the
inner sanctum and look upon the luminous divine glory. Even the high
priest, who could enter only once a year, offered incense which formed a
'cloud' so thick that he could not see God's glorious appearance (Lev.
16:13). The 'cloud' itself could easily have been associated with the
visible heaven that pointed beyond to the unseen heaven, where God
dwelt. Finally, the ark itself was understood to be the footstool of
God's heavenly throne (1 Chr. 28:2; Pss. 99:5; 132:7--8; Is.
[]{#chap2.html#page_36}66:1; Lam. 2:1). For example, 1 Chronicles 28:2
asserts that 'King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my
brethren and my people; I had intended to build a permanent home for the
ark of the covenant of the L[ORD]{.small} and for the footstool of our
God. So I had made preparations to build it."'

Hence, the ark is part of God's heavenly throne-room, and,
appropriately, the space directly above the ark is empty. God cannot be
seen, and no images of him are to be placed there, because he has no
human form and his special glorious dwelling is primarily in heaven and
not on earth (Poythress 1991: 15). Thus, the holy of holies was a
representation of God's unseen heavenly dwelling in his temple amidst
ministering angels and spirits (Is. 6:1--7; Ezek. 1; Rev.
4:1--11).[14](#appen11.html#NFIN17){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN17-1 .apnf}

### Heavenly symbolism of the temple {.int_niv2}

The Old Testament highlights particularly the heavenly symbolism of the
temple, both with respect to the visible and invisible heavens. One of
the best examples of this is the account of the dedication of Solomon's
temple. The 'cloud' that filled Israel's temple when it was completed
and dedicated by Solomon (1 Kgs. 8:10--13; cf. 2 Chr. 5:13b -- 6:2) may
partly be associated with the clouds in the visible heavens that pointed
beyond themselves to God's unseen heavenly dwelling
place.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN18){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN18-1 .apnf}

Two different Hebrew words for 'cloud' are used in this passage, but
they are generally synonymous. The repeated mention of the 'cloud' and
that the temple was 'a lofty place' points more clearly to an attempt to
identify it in some way with the heavens. 'Cloud' obviously refers
elsewhere to a constituent part of the visible heavens or sky. For
example, Job 26:8--9 says, 'He wraps up the waters in His clouds;/And
the cloud does not burst under them./He obscures the face of the full
moon,/And spreads His cloud over it' (cf. also Gen. 9:13--14, 16; Job
7:9). And just as 'lightning' is part of literal 'clouds' (Job 37:11,
15), so Ezekiel portrays God's theophanic 'glory' as 'radiance \[like\]
a great cloud with fire flashing forth' and as 'the appearance of a
rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day' (Ezek. 1:4, 28). That Ezekiel
views such []{#chap2.html#page_37}heavenly descriptions of God's
presence as occurring in the temple is also clear from the cloud that
hides the divine presence in the temple (cf. 10:3--4).

The visible 'cloud' that filled the temple was certainly identified with
the visible heaven but likely also pointed to the invisible heaven. The
preceding references to the 'cloud' in Ezekiel's vision confirms this,
since there the word refers both to a visible meteorological phenomenon
and the invisible presence of God in the unseen heaven. Furthermore, it
is well known that the same Hebrew word for 'heaven' in the Old
Testament is used for both the seen and unseen
dimensions.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN19){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN19-1 .apnf} The
upper part of the visible cosmos came to represent God's dwelling place,
pointing beyond the physical to the divine transcendence and an
'invisible spiritual created order' (cf. 2 Kgs. 6:17; Job 1:1, 16; Ps.
2:4; Zech. 3:1) (Lincoln 1981: 140--141). Thus, again the temple is
associated with the physically created firmament and the invisible
heavenly dwelling of God to which that firmament pointed.

The same luminescent 'cloud' mixed with darkness that filled Solomon's
temple had also hovered over and covered Sinai and the tabernacle during
Israel's wilderness wanderings, suggesting that the earlier forms of the
temple were also reflective of or associated with the
heavens.[17](#appen11.html#NFIN20){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN20-1 .apnf} Hence,
the visible bright aspect of the clouds of the heavens came to be
appropriate vehicles to express the invisible heavenly, radiant presence
of God in the tabernacle and subsequent temple (Exod. 16:10; 40:35; Num.
16:42; Is. 4:5; Ezek. 1:28; 10:3--4).

Solomon's reference to his building of 'a lofty house' in 1 Kings 8:13
refers to an elevated dwelling. The word 'lofty' (*ze˘bul*) occurs only
three times elsewhere in the Old Testament, and always refers to the
'elevated places' in the visible heavens where the 'sun and moon stood'
(Hab. 3:11) and to the invisible 'holy and glorious *elevated place*'
where God 'looks down from heaven' (Is.
63:15).[18](#appen11.html#NFIN21){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN21-1 .apnf} It is
this []{#chap2.html#page_38}invisible place that Solomon sees being
symbolized in 1 Kings 8 by the earthly temple. Accordingly, he describes
the temple figuratively as being in the visible heavens, so that the
bright clouds appropriately surround
it.[19](#appen11.html#NFIN22){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN22-1 .apnf}

The reference to 'winged' figurines around the ark of the covenant in
the above-cited 1 Kings passage (8:6--7) may add further to an upper
atmospheric symbolism. This symbolism appears to have been enhanced in
the tabernacle where its numerous curtains (including the veil before
the holy of holies) were all made of the variegated colours resembling
the sky ('blue and purple and scarlet material', Exod. 26:31) and had
woven into them figures of flying 'cherubim' (i.e., winged bird-like
creatures; so Exod. 26:1, 31; 36:8, 35). Apparently the 'scarlet' colour
was intended to resemble the fiery colour of lightning and, perhaps of
the sun, with the 'blue and purple' resembling sky blue and the dark
blue of dark clouds.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN23){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN23-1
.apnf} So also the 'screen' for the 'gate of the court' and 'doorway of
the tent' was to be made of 'blue and purple and scarlet material'
(Exod. 26:36; 27:16; 36:37; 38:18). Even the 'loops' 'on the edge' of
some of the curtains were to be of 'blue' (Exod. 36:11). Likewise, the
priests were to cover all the furniture of the tabernacle with 'blue'
material when dismantling the tabernacle for transport (Num. 4:5--13).
All of the colours of these inner tabernacle furnishings were likely
reproduced in Solomon's temple, since it was the permanent establishment
of the mobile tabernacle and since the first-century historian Josephus
testifies that the later Herodian temple of Jesus' day, modelled on
Solomon's, contained the numerous curtains that the tabernacle also had
(see *War* 5.210--214; *Ant.* 3.132, 183).

### []{#chap2.html#page_39}Symbolism of the priest's robe in relation to the temple {.int_niv2}

It is apparent that aspects of the priest's robe contained cosmic
symbolism. Like the tabernacle curtains, the various parts of the high
priests' attire were also woven of 'blue and purple and scarlet
material' because it was also to reflect the cosmos. The square shape of
the breast-piece corresponded to the square shape (*tetragōnos*) of 'the
holy place and temple', the 'altar', and the 'mercy seat' (see
[LXX]{.small} of Exod. 27:1; 30:2; Ezek. 41:21; 43:16; and [LXX]{.small}
\[Alexandrinus\] of Ezek. 43:17). Interestingly, the Greek Old Testament
even applies the word 'foursquare' to the high priest's 'breast piece of
judgment' (Exod. 28:16; 36:16). If this symbolic identification of the
priest with parts of the temple is correct, then it is natural that the
priest's clothing was also of the same colour as the various inner
furnishings of the temple (about 12 times parts of his attire are said
to be of 'blue and purple and scarlet' and his robe was all 'blue',
phrases also used to describe the curtains of the tabernacle; cf. also
'a blue cord' on the turban \[Exod. 28:37; 39:31\]).

I have argued in an earlier work that the jewels on the priest's
breast-piece, which were a small replica of the holy of holies,
symbolized the earthly or heavenly cosmos, and the same jewels are part
of the new city-temple in Revelation
21.[21](#appen11.html#NFIN24){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN24-1 .apnf}
Accordingly, one needs to picture the precious stones on the priest's
breast-piece set within the larger background of the long blue robe as
an apt model of the stars set within the cosmic tent of the dark bluish
heavens. Correspondingly, the same scene on a larger scale was depicted
with the seven 'luminaries' on the lampstand placed within the broader
backdrop of the sky-coloured curtains covering the inside of the
tent-like tabernacle. The seven lamps on the lampstand especially stood
out in the holy place since the four thick curtains so thoroughly
covered the tabernacle that no natural light would have come in unless
the curtain at the entrance were pulled back (Longman 2001: 55). Both
the priest and the tabernacle were designed to represent the creative
work of God 'who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads
them out like a tent to dwell in', and 'who has created . . . \[the\]
host' of stars to hang in (Is. 40:22, 26; similarly, Ps. 19:4b--5a: in
the 'heavens' God 'has placed a tent for the sun, which is as a
bridegroom coming out of his chamber').

It is, in fact, discernible that there are broadly three sections of the
priest's garment that resemble the three sections of the temple. First,
[]{#chap2.html#page_40}the outermost part at the bottom (the outer
court), on which were sewn 'pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet'
along 'with variegated
flowers'[22](#appen11.html#NFIN25){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN25-1 .apnf}
represented the fertile earth. Secondly, the main body of the bluish
robe (the holy place), within which and on the upper part of which are
set the jewels, symbolized the stars that are set in the sky. Thirdly,
the square ephod resembles the square holy of holies, within which were
placed the Urim and Thumim, stones representing God's revelatory
presence (the priest's crown with 'holy to the L[ORD]{.small}' inscribed
on it may represent the divine presence in heaven or above the ark in
the temple's sanctuary that the ephod symbolized). Given all this
symbolism, one can well understand the assertion in the *Letter of
Aristeas* that anyone who saw the fully attired high priest 'would think
he had come out of this world into another one' (99).

If the precious stones on the priest's breast correspond partly to the
lamps on the lampstand, as suggested above, then this identifies them
further with the heavenly luminaries, since we have seen that the
lampstand lights are likewise identified with the heavenly stars. This
link of the precious stones with the starry heavens may provide an
important clue to the significance of the precious stones and metals
that compose the temple itself. Why is the temple so heavily adorned
with these extremely valuable and shiny materials? Before answering this
question, it is important to highlight just how much the temple was
adorned with these expensive items.

The 'foundation' of the temple building (containing the holy place and
holy of holies) was laid with 'gold', 'silver', and 'precious stones':
'they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the
house' (1 Kgs. 5:17); 'and the inner sanctuary . . . he overlaid . . .
with pure gold . . . So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with
pure gold' (1 Kgs. 6:20--21). He also covered with gold the altar
(1 Kgs. 6:20), the cherubim around the ark (1 Kgs. 6:28), the floor of
the temple (1 Kgs. 6:30), and the engraved work on the temple doors
(1 Kgs. 6:35; see similarly 2 Chr. 3 -- 4). Indeed, '100,000 talents of
gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver' were 'prepared' for the
construction of the temple house (1 Chr. 22:14; likewise 1 Chr. 22:16;
29:2--7). First Chronicles 29:1--7 refers to 'gold . . . silver . . .
onyx stones and inlaid stones, stones of antimony, and stones of various
colors, and all kinds of precious stones' to be used for all the various
parts, pieces of furniture, and utensils of the
temple.[23](#appen11.html#NFIN26){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN26-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap2.html#page_41}Thus, the same precious stones and metals used in
the construction of the temple were also used in the fashioning of the
priest's clothing (e.g., in Exod. 28), enhancing the connection between
the two.[24](#appen11.html#NFIN27){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN27-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, the same precious stones are used to describe the heavenly
dwelling of God, further associating the same stones of the temple and
of the priestly raiment with the heavenly
sphere.[25](#appen11.html#NFIN28){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN28-1 .apnf}

How does the connection between the precious stones and the starry
heavens provide an important clue to the significance of the precious
stones and metals that were used to adorn the holy place and holy of
holies? It is likely that part of the reason for so many precious stones
and metals in one place is that they were intended to remind one of the
luminous splendour of the starry sky, which, we have seen, itself
pointed to God's transcendent glorious dwelling place that was concealed
from human sight (indeed, even today one of the main uses of our English
word 'metallic' is to indicate that which is 'shiny, glossy, gleaming,
lustrous', etc.).[26](#appen11.html#NFIN29){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN29-1
.apnf}

Another aspect of the stones on the priest's robe also suggests that the
function of such gems in the temple is to reflect divine, heavenly
glory. God commands Moses to 'make holy garments for Aaron . . . for
*glory and for beauty*' (Exod. 28:2; cf. likewise 28:40). The
description of the garments (Exod. 28:4--43) is dominated by
descriptions of precious stones or of gold cloth or metal that adorned
the robes.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN30){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN30-1 .apnf}
Certainly, therefore, the goal of the gold and stone-work of the robe
was included in the purpose of reflecting the 'glory and beauty',
presumably of God. The word for 'glory' (*kābôd*) is the typical word
for God's glorious theophanic revelation of himself to Israel at Sinai,
at the tabernacle and at the end of time. The word for 'beauty'
(*tip'ārâ*) []{#chap2.html#page_42}is less often used. Not
insignificantly, in the midst of a description of the gems and valuable
metals composing the temple (2 Chr. 3:4--10), this word is chosen to
explain why the precious stones were so heavily used in constructing
Solomon's temple: Solomon 'adorned the house with precious stone for the
purpose of *beauty*' (2 Chr.
3:6).[28](#appen11.html#NFIN31){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN31-1 .apnf} The
common use of this word for the purpose of the stones on the priest's
clothing and the stones of the temple further indicates the same
function of the two: they were to reflect glorious beauty.

Interestingly, this word 'beauty' is also associated with description of
the heavenly light-sources as metaphors for God's beauteous glory. The
Isaiah 60 prophecy of Israel's restoration in the new creation is
significant in this respect, since it combines the mention of precious
metals in relation to 'beautifying' the temple and God, whose lustrous
beauty is compared to the light of the sun and moon. God's end-time
glorious presence over Israel is described as 'light' that 'has risen'
in the midst of 'darkness', so that Israel might experience 'the
brightness of . . . rising' (Is. 60:1--3). At this time, the nations
will bring riches (including 'gold') in order to 'beautify' God's
'glorious house' (60:5--7), and they will bring 'their silver and their
gold with them, for the name of the L[ORD]{.small} your God \[i.e., the
temple where God
dwelt\][29](#appen11.html#NFIN32){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN32-1 .apnf} . . .
because *he has beautified* you' (i.e., caused his splendorous beauty to
reflect on Israel; 60:9). The 'wealth of the nations' will pour in to
Israel '*To beautify* the place of My sanctuary . . . /And *make* the
place of My feet *glorious*' (Is.
60:11--13).[30](#appen11.html#NFIN33){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN33-1 .apnf}
Isaiah 60:16--17 reiterates the same theme: 'You will also suck the milk
of nations . . . Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of
iron I will bring silver', which, again, contributes to the goal of
divine 'beautification' (Is. 60:19: 'you will have God . . . for your
*beauty*'). However, instead of explicitly viewing this divine beauty as
being centred in the end-time temple, as earlier in the chapter, it is
spoken of as replacing the sun and the moon and shining on Israel in a
greater way than these former light-sources had ever done:

::: cita
::: stroplg
[]{#chap2.html#page_43}^19^'No longer will you have the sun for light by
day,

Nor for brightness will the moon give you light;

But you will have the L[ORD]{.small} for an everlasting light,

And your God for your *beauty*.

^20^'Your sun will set no more,

Neither will your moon wane;

For you will have the L[ORD]{.small} for an everlasting light,

And the days of your mourning will be finished.'
:::

::: cita_source
(Is. 60:19--20)
:::
:::

Here we find God's 'beauty' explicitly compared to the splendour of the
sun and moon, though his brightness is incomparably greater, so that the
chapter ends with astronomical metaphors as it began (note 'light',
'brightness', and 'rising' in 60:1--3). And, again, the result of this
will be that God 'may be beautified' (verbal form of *tip'ārâ*; 60:21).
Thus, Isaiah 60 repeatedly refers to God's 'beauty' being expressed as a
supernova-like sun and moon primarily in his eschatological sanctuary
and outwards, *toward which the bringing in of precious metals
contributes*.[31](#appen11.html#NFIN34){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN34-1 .apnf}
The main light sources of the old creation were representations, though
only faintly, of the glorious light that God would shine in the new
creation.

It is unlikely to be a coincidence that the precious metals of the new
creational temple listed in Revelation 21:18--20, which allude partly to
the jewels of the priestly attire in Exodus 28:17--20 (see Beale 1999a:
1080--1088), function to reflect God's glory (especially in light of
4:3, 9--11 and 21:11), and that they are directly followed by allusions
to the same Isaiah texts crucial to the directly preceding discussion
(Is. 60:3, 5, 11, 19) (see Beale 1999a: 1093--1101). Revelation 21 makes
the same connections that we have pursued within the Old Testament
itself. Accordingly, Isaiah appears to have considered that Israel's
earthly temple could be called 'beautiful' (Is. 64:11)
[]{#chap2.html#page_44}because it was a reflection of God's 'beautiful
habitation' that was in 'heaven' (Is. 63:15), which would eventually
descend to fill the earth with divine glory (Is. 64:1--3;
66:1--2)[32](#appen11.html#NFIN35){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN35-1 .apnf} and of
which Revelation is the fuller explanation.

The following considerations further support the conclusion that the
metals in the temple were intended to recall the starry heavens and,
ultimately, the luminous glory of God to which the stars themselves
pointed. First, the precious materials adorn only the temple house
proper and not any part of the courtyard. This fits with our
identification of the holy place with the starry sky and inner room
there as the unseen heavenly domain. On the other hand, the only metal
used in the courtyard is the less expensive and less radiant bronze
(e.g., the altar is made of bronze), which is also the only area of the
temple complex that common Israelite worshippers could enter (Poythress
1991: 16).

Secondly, Scripture itself describes part of God's glory in his heavenly
palace or temple through portrayals of precious stones. The first such
depiction occurs at the Sinai theophany: when Moses and the elders of
Israel saw God in the cloud at the top of Mount Sinai, 'under his feet
there appeared to be constructed tile-work of sapphire, *as clear as the
body of the heavens*'[33](#appen11.html#NFIN36){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN36-1
.apnf} (Exod. 24:10; cf. 19:16--20). Here we find a conglomeration of
precious stone describing the divine environment of God's heavenly
temple that had temporarily descended to the top of Sinai (and we shall
propose in a following chapter that Sinai was conceived of as a
temple).[34](#appen11.html#NFIN37){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN37-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, this gem-like pavement is said to be 'as clear \[or 'pure'
blue\] as the body of the heavens'. Thus, the blue colour of the stone
is comparable to the majestic appearance of the heavens (see also
Cassuto 1967: 314).

Likewise Ezekiel's description of the heavenly dimension that
corresponded to the earthly temple includes virtually the same reference
as found in the Exodus 24 passage: 'now above the vault of heaven
\[firmament\] that was over the heads' of the living cherubim 'there was
something resembling a throne, like sapphire in appearance', which
itself was under a human-like depiction of God (Ezek. 1:26). Ezekiel
10:1 has an almost identical description, though there 'something like a
sapphire stone . . . resembling a throne' was not
[]{#chap2.html#page_45}above but '*in* the vault of heaven that was over
the heads of the cherubim'. Ezekiel 1:27--28 describes the divine figure
itself 'like glowing metal that looked like fire . . . and there was a
radiance around Him. As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a
rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was
the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the L[ORD]{.small}.' It
is clear that the sapphire is not only directly compared to the
appearance of the heavens but is associated with another startling
feature of the sky: the brilliant colours of a rainbow reflective of the
sun. Furthermore, the sapphire is part of the immediate heavenly
surroundings that, like the 'glowing metal', reflected the radiance of
the divine glory.[35](#appen11.html#NFIN38){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN38-1
.apnf} The precious stones in Revelation also describe the radiant glory
of God's dwelling in the heavenly temple (Rev. 4:3; 21:11, 18--20).

Therefore, though every part of the preceding analysis about the
astronomical significance of the precious metals and stones will not
necessarily be equally persuasive, it is plausible to understand that
the gleaming stones and metals composing the temple and the priest's
garments functioned to remind one of the sparkling stars in the heavens,
which themselves pointed to God's glorious presence in his invisible
heavenly temple-court.

## Judaism's view of the symbolism of the temple {.int_niv1}

Jewish interpreters of the Old Testament reflect on the temple and
understand it and develop it in ways that are similar to and consistent
with our above analysis. What was more implicit in the Old Testament
portrayal of the temple becomes explicitly drawn out by commentators in
Judaism.

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-004 .niv2}
### Symbolism of particular parts of the temple {.int_niv2}

Somewhat similar to our above analysis of the symbolism of the three
parts of the temple, Josephus understood the tripartite structure of the
tabernacle to signify 'the earth \[= outer court\] and the sea \[= inner
court\], since these . . . are accessible to all; but the third portion
\[= holy of holies\] he reserved for God alone, because heaven also is
inaccessible to men' (*Ant*. 3.181; cf. 3.123). Likewise, in support of
the []{#chap2.html#page_46}idea that the outer court was associated with
the visible sea, *Midrash Rabbah Numbers *13:19 says, 'the court . . .
encompassed the Tabernacle as the sea encompasses the
world'.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN39){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN39-1 .apnf} In
support of the idea that the outer court represented the earthly
habitation, one of the early Aramaic Bibles says that Moses was to 'set
up the courtyard round about for the sake of the merits of the fathers
of the world who surround the people of the house of Israel round about'
(Exod. 40:8 of *Tg. Pseudo-Jonathon Exodus*).

Early Judaism also makes explicit the biblical implication about the
lampstand by directly asserting that the seven lamps on the lampstand
symbolized the planets (Josephus, *Ant*. 3.145; *War* 5.217; Philo,
*Rer. Div. Her.* 221--225; *Vit. Mos.* 2.102--105; *Quaest. Exod.*
2.73--81; Clement of Alexandria, *Stromata*, 5.6) or heaven (Philo,
*Rer. Div. Her*. 227). These lamps are also equated with the 'lights in
the expanse of heaven' from Genesis
1:14--16.[37](#appen11.html#NFIN40){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN40-1 .apnf}

In addition, Josephus and Philo discuss a number of ways in which the
tabernacle or temple, or parts of it, symbolically reflect the cosmos
(Philo, *Vit. Mos.* 2.71--145; cf. *Plant*. 47--50; *Spec. Leg.* 1.66;
Josephus, *Ant*. 3.123, 179--187). They also observe that the outer veil
of the holy place and curtains of the tabernacle and temple were made to
reflect the four elements of the cosmos: earth, air, water and fire
(Philo, *Quaest. Exod.* 2.85; *Vit. Mos.* 2.87--88; Josephus, *War*
5.212--214; *Ant*.
3.183).[38](#appen11.html#NFIN41){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN41-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, the 'tapestry' hanging over the outer entrance into the
temple 'typified the universe' and on it 'was portrayed a panorama of
the heavens' (Josephus, *War* 5.210--214). Indeed, all of the curtains
in the temple contained 'colours seeming so exactly to resemble those
that meet the eye in the heavens' (Josephus, *Ant*. 3.132). Likewise,
the veil symbolizes the airy covering of the earth that separates the
changeable part of the world beneath from the unchanging heavenly region
(Philo, *Quaest. Exod.* 2.91). The curtains of the temple were woven of
things []{#chap2.html#page_47}that resembled the elements of which the
world was made, since the created world itself was the macrocosmic
temple after which Israel's small temple was modelled (Philo, *Quaest.
Exod.* 2.85). These observations support the larger point strongly
suggested in the Old Testament descriptions that the temple is a
small-scale image of the entire universe, especially the visible and
invisible heavenly dimensions.

In reflecting on the overall significance of the tabernacle, Josephus
says, 'every one of these objects \[of the tabernacle\] is intended to
recall and represent the nature of the universe' (*Ant*. 3.180).

### Symbolism of the priest's robe in relation to the temple {.int_niv2}

Just as Judaism further developed the Old Testament perspective on the
heavenly significance of the temple curtains, so likewise do Jewish
commentators develop further the biblical notion of the meaning of the
priest's attire. Both Josephus and Philo understand the jewels on the
priestly breast-piece to be symbolic of the twelve
constellations.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN42){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN42-1 .apnf}
Josephus (*War* 4.324) affirms that priests are referred to as leading
the 'cosmic worship' (*tēs kosmikēs thrēskeias*). Likewise, both
Josephus and Philo understand the garments of the high priest to
symbolize the whole cosmos (Philo, *Vit. Mos.* 2.117--126, 133--135,
143; Josephus, *Ant.* 3.180, 183--187). For example, Philo says
explicitly that the high priest 'represents the world' and is a
'microcosm' (or 'small world', *brachys kosmos*; so *Vit. Mos.* 2.135).
In addition, he states that the priest's 'long robe and ephod' were
'woven . . . to represent the universe' (*Vit. Mos.* 2.143), and the
'sacred vesture was designed' to be 'a copy of the universe' (Philo,
*Spec. Leg.* 1.95). The 'garments' that the priest 'puts on as raiment
are the world' (*Fug.* 110) and 'is a copy and replica of the whole
heaven' (*Som*. 1.215).

Other sectors of Judaism held virtually the same view of the priest's
clothing. *Wisdom of Solomon* 18:24 (2nd century [BC]{.small} -- 1st
century [AD]{.small}) likewise understands the high priest's garment and
jewels to be symbolic of the entire cosmos: 'in the long garment was the
whole world, and in the four rows of the stones was the glory of the
fathers'. The reference to the 'glory of the fathers' is also an
allusion to the blessing upon Abraham's seed that would result in
blessing to the whole world (so also 18:22). One of the Aramaic
translations of Exodus 28:17 and 39:10 affirms a cosmic symbolism of the
stones: the []{#chap2.html#page_48}'four rows of precious gems \[were\]
corresponding to the four corners of the
world'.[40](#appen11.html#NFIN43){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN43-1 .apnf}

Comparable to the emblematic meaning of the curtains of the tabernacle
and temple, Philo held that the priest's 'gown is all of violet, and is
thus an image of the air; for the air is naturally black' (*Vit. Mos.*
2.118). Josephus similarly says the 'blue' of the 'high priest's tunic .
. . signifies' the 'arch of heaven' and his 'head-dress appears . . . to
symbolize heaven, being blue' (*Ant.* 3.184, 186).

Therefore, early Judaism clearly understood the priests' clothing to be
a microcosm of the entire creation. The most likely reason for this is
because they also believed the priestly attire was a microcosm of the
temple itself, which was also a small model of the entire cosmos.

## Conclusion: symbolism of the temple in the Old Testament and Judaism {.int_niv1}

Taking all of the preceding data into consideration, the three parts of
Israel's temple represented the three parts of the cosmos: the outer
court symbolized the visible earth (both land and sea, the place where
humans lived); the holy place primarily represented the visible heavens
(though there was also garden symbolism); the holy of holies stood for
the invisible heavenly dimension of the cosmos where God
dwelt[41](#appen11.html#NFIN44){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN44-1 .apnf}
(apparently not even the high priest who entered there once a year could
see because of the cloud from the incense which he was to put on the
fire; cf. Lev. 16:32).[42](#appen11.html#NFIN45){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN45-1
.apnf} As we will see more fully later, this understanding of the temple
as a small model of the entire cosmos is part of a larger perspective in
which the temple pointed forward to a huge worldwide sanctuary in which
God's presence would dwell in every part of the cosmos. The conception
also is a linchpin for better understanding why John later pictures the
entire new heavens and earth to be one mammoth temple in which God
dwells as he had formerly dwelt in the holy of holies.

[]{#chap2.html#page_49}This cosmic perspective of the temple is
discernible in the Old Testament, and it is developed in Judaism. Before
concluding this section, a word is in order about the evidence adduced
from the Jewish authors Philo and Josephus. While it is true that Philo
and Josephus had varying interpretations of the temple symbolism, their
views intersect at significant points. Furthermore, they both testify to
a general cosmological understanding of the temple held by mainstream
contemporary Jewish thought, especially where their views overlapped.
Philo himself says that his symbolic understanding of the lampstand was
generally acknowledged during his time (*Quaest. Exod.* 2.78; cf. also
*Rer. Div. Her.* 224).[43](#appen11.html#NFIN46){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN46-1
.apnf} That their perspective was probably not idiosyncratic is
suggested also by recalling that other Jewish sources testify to the
same cosmic viewpoint (the earliest being Wisdom, followed by the Targum
and then the profusion of references in the later midrashic and Talmudic
literature). Though every one of their detailed symbolic identifications
is unlikely to be correct, their approach generally represented an
accurate understanding of the Old Testament temple's emblematic meaning.

Among the admittedly few *explicit* biblical passages supporting the
cosmic temple thesis (Levenson 1984: 289--298), Levenson offers Isaiah
6:3: 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the L[ORD]{.small} of hosts, The whole earth
is full of His glory.' He contends that this 'glory' is the divine
radiance by which God manifests his presence in the temple. The
significance of Isaiah's vision of the luminescent smoke filling the
temple (6:4) is explained by the seraphim to mean that the whole world
manifests Yahweh's cultic heavenly glory that has unique correspondence
in the earthly temple. Isaiah 6:3b could well be rendered 'the fullness
of the whole earth is his glory' (an alternative rendering proposed by
Levenson and the [NASB]{.small}), that is, the entire world reflects
God's glory in the
temple.[44](#appen11.html#NFIN47){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN47-1 .apnf} In the
same way that God's glory (*kābôd*) filled both the tabernacle and
temple at the conclusion of their construction, Isaiah 6:3 affirms with
the same terms that God's glory fills the entire cosmos (Levenson 1984:
289). While Levenson grants that the biblical evidence is 'muted and
implicit', the Old Testament 'evidence is not quite so lacking as one
would think at first glance' (Levenson 1984: 286).

[]{#chap2.html#page_50}In the light of all the above evidence, R. E.
Clements's conclusion about similar evidence is cautious and judicious:

::: cita
Not all of these supposed symbolic references of features of the temple
are convincing, but the essential claim that the temple and its
furnishings did possess cosmic, or naturalistic, symbolism must be
upheld. Such features were designed to stress the divine power over the
created order, and to establish the temple as a source of blessing for
the land and people of Israel. The underlying idea was that the temple
was a microcosm of the macrocosm, so that the building gave visual
expression to the belief in Yahweh's dominion over the world . . . We
need not suppose that every Israelite worshipper was conscious of this .
. . Thus the temple building . . . signified the cosmic rule of God who
was worshipped there . .
.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN48){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN48-1 .apnf}
:::

I have tried to discuss the symbolic meaning of the temple as a
miniature model of the cosmos by observing features of the structure
itself and by tracing the use of words and concepts about the temple
that occur elsewhere in the Old Testament in other contexts. As Vern
Poythress has concluded at the end of his study of the temple, 'we must
of course recognize that some associations and connections are more
obvious than others, and that we may possibly be wrong about some
details. But the overall picture emerges clearly' (Poythress 1991: 39).

## Israel's temple in the light of the Ancient Near Eastern view of the earthly temple as a reflection of the heavenly or cosmic temple {.int_niv1}

Some scholars like de Vaux (1965: 328--329) allege that early Judaism's
explicit cosmic understanding of the temple was a late
[]{#chap2.html#page_51}allegorical development. A good response to this
may be found not only in the evidence from the Old Testament itself but
also the observation that Ancient Near Eastern archaeology and texts
portray ancient temples as microcosms of heavenly temples or of the
universe in a manner similar to that of the Old
Testament.[46](#appen11.html#NFIN49){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN49-1 .apnf} It
is now widely known that archaeological ruins and texts from the Ancient
Near East portray ancient temples as small models of heavenly temples or
of the universe conceived of as a temple.

As noted in the introduction to this chapter, we should not think that
Israel's temple was like her pagan neighbours because she merely copied
the religious traditions around her. The likeness should be viewed, at
least, from two perspectives. First, the similarity is intended at times
to be a protest statement that, while the pagan nations think that they
have cornered the market on divine revelation from their gods who dwell
in their temples, in fact, their gods are false and their temples purely
idolatrous institutions, which are really the den of demons (Deut.
32:17; Ps. 106:37; 1 Cor. 10:19--20). From another angle, it is
appropriate to ask whether or not there was anything in ancient pagan
religion and its institutions that resembled the truth about the true
God and his designs for humanity. Certainly, there was not special
revelation that these nations had received in order that they would come
into saving relation to the true God. Nevertheless, just as the image of
God is not erased but distorted in unbelieving humanity, it is plausible
that some of the affinities in ancient pagan beliefs and religious
institutions to that of Israel's may be due to the fact that they are
garbled, shadowy representations about the being of the biblical God and
of his design for his dwelling place.

Reminding ourselves about these perspectives, we proceed to investigate
the Ancient Near Eastern beliefs about the temples that housed their
gods.

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-006 .niv2}
### General symbolism of the temple {.int_niv2}

One of the best examples of cosmic symbolism of temples is the notion in
the *Enuma Elish* 6.113, where it is said concerning the building of
Marduk's temple, 'He shall make on earth the counterpart of what he
brought to pass in
heaven.'[47](#appen11.html#NFIN50){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN50-1 .apnf}
Likewise, the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III restored a temple for the
god Amon and made it 'like the []{#chap2.html#page_52}heavens' (Breasted
1906: 2:239 §601; see also 240 §604). And Ramses III (1195--1164
[BC]{.small}) affirmed about his god: 'I made for thee an august house
in Nubia . . . the likeness of the heavens' (Breasted 1906: 4:123 §218;
see also 2:240 §604). The same Pharaoh said of an Amon temple, 'I made
for thee an august palace . . . like the great house of \[the god\] Atum
which is in heaven.'[48](#appen11.html#NFIN51){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN51-1
.apnf} It was not unusual for Egyptian temples to be called 'heaven' on
earth (see Keel 1985: 172 for several examples).

One of the earliest Mesopotamian accounts of a temple being closely
associated with the heavens is that found in the commemoration of King
Gudea's building and dedication of a temple in Lagash for the god
Ningirsu (c. 2112--2004 [BC]{.small}). 'The building of the temple' was
done 'according to its holy star(s)' (Averbeck 2000: 421) and the
builders 'were making the temple grow (high) like a mountain range;
making it float in mid-heaven like a cloud . . .' (428). The new temple
was like 'brilliant moonlight . . . shining. It illuminated the land,
(and) . . . rivaled the newborn Suen (the moon god)' (430). This is a
theme that spans the centuries in the ancient world. Almost two
millennia later, in a hymn to Mar, the god of the kingdom of Rashu and
Arashu (near Babylonia and Elam, third century [BC]{.small}), there is
the exhortation 'Oh, let them build, in heaven, your house, concealed,
with stars.'[49](#appen11.html#NFIN52){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN52-1 .apnf}
Similarly, the Sumerian *Keš Temple Hymn* portrays the 'temple, at its
top rising like the sun, at its bottom setting like the moon', and it
refers to the 'temple' as that 'which sketches the outlines of heaven
and earth' (lines 50 \[cf. 87\], 5, in Sjöberg et al. 1969: 170, 172,
176).

The most explicit Old Testament parallel to these references is
Psalm 78:69, noted earlier: 'And He built His sanctuary like the
heights,/Like the earth which He has founded *forever* \[or from
eternity\].' Similarly, Solomon's description of the temple is quite
similar to that of King Gudea's temple, which was clearly compared to
the heavens and its light sources: 'the L[ORD]{.small} has said that He
would dwell in the thick cloud. I have surely built Thee a lofty house'
(1 Kgs. 8:12--13; recall the comparable portrayal of the builders of
Gudea's temple, who 'were making the temple grow (high) . . . making it
float in mid-heaven like a cloud'). Like Israel's temple, in some way
the temples of Marduk, Amon and other gods were designed to symbolize
not merely heaven but the entire cosmos.

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-007 .niv2}
### []{#chap2.html#page_53}Symbolism of particular parts of the temple {.int_niv2}

Not only were temples as a whole designed to portray the cosmos, but
various parts of earthly temples were made to resemble aspects of the
entire earth, conceived of as a huge cosmic temple. For instance, the
arboreal lampstand of Israel's temple was analogous to the portraits of
and actual presence of trees in ancient temples that were viewed as
'cosmic trees', symbolizing the life-essence of the entire world. In
particular, taken together with other cultic appurtenances of cosmic
symbolism, the tree image pointed to the temple as 'the cosmic center of
the universe, at the place where heaven and earth converge and thus from
where God's control over the universe is
effected'.[50](#appen11.html#NFIN53){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN53-1 .apnf} The
metaphorical picture is that of a huge tree atop a cosmic mountain whose
height reaches heaven, whose branches encompass the earth, and whose
roots sink down to the lowest parts of the
earth.[51](#appen11.html#NFIN54){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN54-1 .apnf} This
tree was the central life-giving force for the entire creation (there is
portrayal of such trees in Dan. 4; Ezek. 17; 19;
31).[52](#appen11.html#NFIN55){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN55-1 .apnf}

Similarly, the bronze 'sea' basin in the courtyard of Israel's temple
finds striking correspondence to ancient temples of the Levant, which
also have artificial replicas of seas, symbolizing either the chaotic
forces stilled by the god or the waters of life at the cosmic
centre.[53](#appen11.html#NFIN56){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN56-1 .apnf} In
still other respects ancient temples reflected cosmic
symbolism.[54](#appen11.html#NFIN57){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN57-1 .apnf}
Temples were symbolically the 'embodiment of the cosmic mountain'
representing the original hillock first emerging from the primordial
waters at the beginning of creation; these waters themselves were
symbolized in temples together with fertile trees receiving life from
such waters.[55](#appen11.html#NFIN58){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN58-1 .apnf}

The names of various Mesopotamian temples also express specific
[]{#chap2.html#page_54}notions about their 'cosmological place and
function' and hence symbolic significance (George 1993: 59). There are
many examples of temples repeatedly being called such names as 'House
like Heaven', 'House of Heaven and Underworld', 'House, Bond of the
Land', 'Apsu \['fresh water or sea'\]-House', 'House of the Mountains',
'House of the Pure New Moon',
etc.[56](#appen11.html#NFIN59){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN59-1 .apnf} That
'Apsu' was 'appointed . . . for shrines' (*Enuma Elish* 1.76) suggests
that cultic places typically were intended to derive their sacred water
from rivers but likely also that temples were to be closely associated
and symbolically identified with cosmic water.

One of the famous Mesopotamian inscriptions, portraying the Babylonian
King Nabuapaliddin entering a temple, combines some of the prominent
symbolic elements noted so far in identifying the temple with the
cosmos: the seven main light-sources seen by the naked eye (sun, moon,
Venus, and four other planets), a palm pillar and an ocean (Keel 1985:
172--174). Similarly, a wall painting from Mari pictures a temple
containing trees, four cherubim, two mountains at its base, four streams
and plants growing out of the streams (Keel 1985: 142--143). There is
thus abundant evidence from the ancient world that temples symbolized
the cosmos in various ways.

Temples in the Ancient Near East also generally exhibited the same
three-part structure as found in Israel's
temple,[57](#appen11.html#NFIN60){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN60-1 .apnf} often
with the similar symbolic significance: outer court = the visible sea
and earth where humans live; an inner court inside a building = the
visible heavens (and also garden terrain); and a holy of holies = the
dwelling of the god. For example, Egyptian cult complexes from the New
Kingdom period (1570 [BC]{.small}) onwards exhibited an increasing
gradation in sacredness beginning with the outer court and proceeding to
a zone of greater holiness and then climaxing in an inner womb-like
sanctuary. For the Egyptians 'the temple was . . . the cosmos in
microcosm'.[58](#appen11.html#NFIN61){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN61-1 .apnf} The
[]{#chap2.html#page_55}outer court had its outer wall constructed of mud
bricks from the Nile that were patterned to look like waves of sea or
lake water. There was also a pond or small lake for ceremonial washing,
representing primeval waters (Wilkinson 2000: 72). There were scenes on
the gateways of the Pharaoh's victories over enemies and of his skill in
hunting, typical scenes of the world and the king's rule over it. All
Egyptians, regardless of societal rank, could come into this outer
section, as was also the case in Israel's temple courtyard (this likely
included women,[59](#appen11.html#NFIN62){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN62-1 .apnf}
who were later sequestered into an additional court outside the original
outer court in Herod's redevelopment of the temple).

The second zone of sacredness in Egyptian temples was ornamented with
solar images. The two trapezoidal pylon towers forming the gateway
leading into it symbolized the peaks of mountains that were on the
eastern horizon where the sun rose daily (could this be the symbolism of
the two mammoth pillars leading into the Israelite temple's holy place?
See 1 Kgs. 7:15--22). Battle and hunting scenes were on the inside of
the outer courtyard wall and on the external side of the gate leading
into the second court. All of these images were transitional indicators
between the earthly symbolism of the outer region to that of the next
inner sphere, which apparently symbolized the visible heavens (stars,
moon and sun were also inscribed on ceilings, though whether this
included the most holy sanctum is not
clear).[60](#appen11.html#NFIN63){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN63-1 .apnf}
Likewise, the east--west orientation of the axial path, which led to the
innermost sanctum, signified the daily circuit of the sun and had solar
images along its route. The entire temple complex also symbolized the
horizon, where the sun rose and set.

Intriguingly, like the holy place in Solomon's temple, so the second
section of Egyptian temples contained garden imagery: bases of walls
symbolized the swamp, columns represented plants, ceilings signified the
sky, and the floors the
earth.[61](#appen11.html#NFIN64){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN64-1 .apnf} The
temple façade had designs of lily and papyrus plants and its columns
were adorned with images of palms, papyrus, lotus and
reeds.[62](#appen11.html#NFIN65){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN65-1 .apnf} If the
two big columns at the outer porch of the holy place did not symbolize
mountains at the horizon, then, in the light of the Mesopotamian and
Assyrian []{#chap2.html#page_56}(see Bloch-Smith 1994: 19, 22--27), as
well as Egyptian,
Persian[63](#appen11.html#NFIN66){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN66-1 .apnf} and
Syro-Phoenician[64](#appen11.html#NFIN67){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN67-1 .apnf}
evidence, perhaps they represented giant trees, since they were
ornamented with vegetation (clusters of pomegranates and lilies) at the
top.

Depictions of garden imagery in the second part of the temple might seem
to contradict the prior conclusion that the second sacred space in both
Israel's and pagan temples primarily symbolized the visible heaven. As
we will see at the conclusion of this chapter, especially with respect
to Israel's temple, this is not necessarily inconsistent with the star
imagery of the holy place, since it was also intended to mimic the
Garden of Eden, which we will argue was the 'holy place' in the first
primeval temple (e.g., the lampstand with seven lamps representing
luminaries also alluded to the 'tree of life' in Eden). Nevertheless,
there probably was some overlap of symbolism in the various sections of
these temples for other reasons, so that while it is difficult to draw
hard and fast distinctions between them, the broad symbolic divisions
probably remain valid.

### Symbolism of precious metals in temples {.int_niv2}

As we have discussed above, the precious metals used in the construction
of Israel's temple had a sheen that reflected light, apparently designed
in part to remind one of the reflection of the sun, moon and stars in
the heavens (see the discussion above and 1 Chr. 29:2--8; 2 Chr. 3:3--9;
4:20--22; for all the precious metals used; likewise for the inner
furnishings of the tabernacle, see Exod. 26:32; 31:4; 35:32; 36:36).

Descriptions of other temples in the ancient orient suggest further that
the precious metals in Israel's temple possessed cosmic significance.
Royal inscriptions of Assyria regularly compare the inside of renovated
or newly built temples to the heavenly abode of the
deities.[65](#appen11.html#NFIN68){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN68-1 .apnf}
Assyrian kings used precious metals to decorate the interiors of temples
in order to produce a shining glimmer like the heavens above (Niehaus
forthcoming). The Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I (1115--1077
[BC]{.small}) declared that 'the great gods . . . commanded me to
rebuild their shrine . . . Its interior I decorated like the interior of
[]{#chap2.html#page_57}heaven. I decorated its walls as splendidly as
the brilliance of rising stars . .
.'[66](#appen11.html#NFIN69){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN69-1 .apnf} A later
Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal (668--627 [BC]{.small}), said, 'The
sanctuaries of the great gods, my lords, I restored with gold (and)
\[silver\] I decked . . . Esarra . . . I made shine like the writing of
heaven. Every kind of gold (and) silver adornment of a temple I \[ma\]de
. . .' (Peipkorn 1933: 28--29 \[i. 16--23\]).

Nearly identical descriptions are found of the interior of Egyptian
temples. Thutmose III (1490--1436 [BC]{.small}) built an inner sanctuary
for the god Amon and called it, 'His-Great-Seat-is-Like-the-Horizon-of
Heaven'. Likewise, 'its interior was wrought with electrum' in order to
serve as an imitation of the light reflected from the heaven itself
(Breasted 1906: 2:64 §153). Even the liturgical furniture of this
sanctuary was composed of precious metals for the same purpose: 'a great
vase of electrum . . . silver, gold, bronze, and copper . . . the Two
Lands were flooded with their brightness, like the stars in the body of
Nut \[i.e., the sky goddess\], while my statue followed. Offering-tables
of electrum . . . I made . . . for him . . .' (2:68 §164; likewise, with
respect to Amen-hotep II \[1439--1406 [BC]{.small}\], on which see 2:318
§806). Similarly, the Pharaoh Pi-ankhi I (720 [BC]{.small}) created
court furnishings of a temple composed 'of gold like the horizon of
heaven' (4:495 §970) (recall that the inside furniture and utensils of
Israel's temple were covered with precious metal according to 1 Kgs.
6:20--28; 7:48--51).

Queen Hatshepsut (1486--1468 [BC]{.small}) constructed a temple for Amon
with a floor of silver and gold, and said, 'its beauty was like the
horizon of heaven' (2:156
§375).[67](#appen11.html#NFIN70){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN70-1 .apnf} Along
virtually identical lines, Amen-hotep III (1398--1361) built a temple in
Karnak for the deity Amon and constructed it 'of gold . . . unlimited in
malachite and lazuli; a place of rest for the lord of gods, made like
his throne that is in heaven' (2:355 §881); and about the temple of the
same god in Thebes, the same Pharaoh said, 'it resembles the horizon in
heaven when Re rises therein' (2:356 §883). The temple 'ceiling is
painted blue for the sky and is studded with a multitude of golden
stars' (Nelson 1994: 47, 48).

So also Ramses I (1303--1302 [BC]{.small}) constructed 'a temple like
the horizon of heaven, wherein Re \[rises\]' (Breasted 1906: 3:36 §79).
The Pharaoh Seti I (1302--1290 [BC]{.small}) built for the underworld
god Osiris 'a temple like heaven; its divine ennead are like the stars
in it; its []{#chap2.html#page_58}radiance is in the faces (of men) like
the horizon of Re rising therein at early morning' (3:96--97 §232 and
§§236--237). This temple was also referred to as 'a house like the
heavens, its beauty illuminating the Two Lands' (3:98 §240.12; see also
Ismail 2002: 158, with respect to a temple at Karnak). Ramses II, a
successor to Seti, observed about the temple at Karnak that 'its august
columns are of electrum, made like every place that is in heaven. (It
is) mistress of silver, queen of gold, it contains every splendid costly
stone' (3:218 §512; sim. 3:217
§510).[68](#appen11.html#NFIN71){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN71-1 .apnf}
Similarly, Ramses III built doors to a temple with precious stones 'like
the double doors of heaven' (4:122 §216).

This evidence from Mesopotamia and Egypt suggests to some degree that
just as Ancient Near Eastern temples used precious metals to adorn their
temples, the precious metals of Israel's temple also had heavenly
symbolism. Interestingly, even the clothing of Egyptian priests was like
that of Israel's priests, representing both the inner sanctuary and the
heavens (Bryan 2002:
130).[69](#appen11.html#NFIN72){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN72-1 .apnf}
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-009 .niv2}
### Conclusion {.int_niv2}

Evidence from the ancient cultures surrounding Israel points further in
the direction that Israel's tabernacle and temple reflect the cosmos and
that the cosmos itself appears to be a massive temple or will become
such in the future. The Ancient Near Eastern temples are also compatible
with the earlier conclusion that the three sections of Israel's temple
represented the three parts of the
cosmos.[70](#appen11.html#NFIN73){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN73-1 .apnf} The
outer court []{#chap2.html#page_59}symbolized the visible earth (land,
sea, the place of human habitation); the holy place primarily
represented the visible heavens (though garden imagery was included to
recall Eden, which, we will see, was the primeval equivalent of the
later holy place); the holy of holies stood for the invisible heavenly
dimension of the cosmos where God
dwelt.[71](#appen11.html#NFIN74){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN74-1 .apnf}

These commonalities with Israel's temple reflected partial yet true
revelation, though insufficient for a personal knowledge of God. Yet
Israel's temples are not like her neighbours merely because they
reflected some degree of perception about the true reality of God's
dwelling, but because Israel's temple was intended to be viewed as the
true temple to which all other imperfect temples aspired. Israel's
temple was likely a protest statement against all other pretenders, of
whom she was quite aware. In order to make an effective polemical
statement there had to be similarities with the temples of her
neigh-bours, but there also had to be differences. We have discussed the
similarities above. It is appropriate here briefly to highlight the
differences.

One of the major differences is that, whereas in the inner sanctuary of
the pagan temple there was an idol, there was no such thing in the holy
of holies, since God's being cannot be seen, much less an image of it
reproduced by human craft. In addition, while there were a variety of
temples for various gods in each pagan nation, in Israel there was only
one temple, since there was only one true God. Furthermore, in contrast
to priests of other religions who practised magic rituals (incantations,
divination etc.) to manipulate the gods, Israel's priests, indeed all
Israelites, were forbidden to participate in such practices, since God
could not be manipulated. The pagan priests' main function revolved
around caring for and feeding their god in the temple, but Israel's God
had no needs, so that priests only served God through various rituals
designed for worship of the sovereign, self-existing deity that he
was.[72](#appen11.html#NFIN75){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN75-1 .apnf}

Similarly, the gods of the nations needed 'housing' for rest but God
himself says that no human-made structure could adequately be a
[]{#chap2.html#page_60}dwelling for him (cf. 1 Kgs. 8:27; Is. 66:1, on
the latter of which see the next chapter). One reason for this is that,
as we have already hinted and will see later, Israel's temple pointed to
the end-time goal of God's presence residing throughout the entire
cosmos, not merely in one little, isolated structure. The pagan temples
had no such eschatological purpose as a part of their symbolism.

Finally, though parts of Israel's temple, like the neighbouring pagan
temples, symbolized the starry heavens, that symbolism is not
highlighted as much. Why? We believe the reason to be that Israel wanted
to make it clear that she did not worship the stars as gods. Therefore,
while the stellar symbolism is discernible in Israel's temple, it is not
as ornate and ostentatious as in temples dedicated to the sun god and
other astronomical deities. Nevertheless, the cosmic symbols that are
present indicate that Israel's temple was a small model of the heavens
and earth, which points to the end-time goal of God's presence dwelling
throughout the creation and no longer only in the back room of the
temple.

## Divine 'rest' after creating the cosmos and after constructing the sanctuary {.int_niv1}

Levenson summarizes previous research on the Pentateuch and observes
that the creation of the cosmos, the making of the tabernacle and the
building of the temple 'are all described in similar, and at times
identical language'. The reason for the similarity is to indicate 'that
the temple and the world were considered congeneric' (Levenson 1984:
286). Levenson even notes that the similarity is a distillation 'of a
long tradition in the ancient Near East, which binds Temple building and
world building' (1984:
287--288).[73](#appen11.html#NFIN76){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN76-1 .apnf} Such
a connection is also linked to divine 'rest', which occurs subsequently
to the work of creating.

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-010 .niv2}
### God's 'rest' after creating the world, the tabernacle and the temple {.int_niv2}

John Walton has observed a link between creation and the tabernacle. In
this respect, he cites M. Fishbane, following M. Buber, who observes
significant parallels between the creation account and that of the
construction of the tabernacle (Walton 2001: 149) (e.g., cf.
[]{#chap2.html#page_61}respectively Gen. 1:31; 2:1; 2:2; 2:3 with Exod.
39:43; 39:32; 40:33; 39:43). Fishbane notes that Moses' work of
constructing the tabernacle is patterned after God's creation of the
cosmos, using the same language: 'Thus, "Moses saw all the work" which
the people "did" in constructing the tabernacle; "and Moses completed
the work" and "blessed" the people for all their labors' (Fishbane 1979:
12). Fishbane concludes that the tabernacle's construction was
intentionally portrayed in the image of the world's creation.

More specifically, both accounts of the creation and building of the
tabernacle are structured around a series of seven acts: cf. 'And God
said' (Gen. 1:3, 6, 9, 14, 20, 24, 26; cf. vv. 11, 28, 29) and 'the
L[ORD]{.small} said' (Exod. 25:1; 30:11, 17, 22, 34; 31:1, 12)
(Sailhamer 1992: 298--299). In the light of observing similar and
additional parallels between the 'creation of the world' and 'the
construction of the sanctuary', J. Blenkinsopp concludes that 'the place
of worship is a scaled-down cosmos' (1992:
217--218).[74](#appen11.html#NFIN77){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN77-1 .apnf}

Levenson also suggests that the same cosmic significance is to be seen
from the fact that Solomon took seven years to build the temple (1 Kgs.
6:38), that he dedicated it on the seventh month, during the Feast of
Booths (a festival of seven days \[1 Kgs. 8\]), and that his dedicatory
speech was structured around seven petitions (1 Kgs. 8:31--55). Hence,
the building of the temple appears to have been modelled on the
seven-day creation of the world, which also is in line with the building
of temples in seven days elsewhere in the Ancient Near East (Levenson
1988: 78--79). Just as God rested on the seventh day from his work of
creation, so when the creation of the
tabernacle[75](#appen11.html#NFIN78){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN78-1 .apnf} and,
especially, the temple are finished, God takes up a 'resting place'
therein.[76](#appen11.html#NFIN79){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN79-1 .apnf} For
example, Psalm 132:7--8, 13--14 says,

::: stroplg
^7^Let us go into His dwelling place;

Let us worship at His footstool.

^8^Arise, O L[ORD]{.small}, to Thy resting place;

Thou and the ark of Thy strength . . .

[]{#chap2.html#page_62}^13^For the L[ORD]{.small} has chosen Zion;

He has desired it for his habitation.

^14^'This is My resting place forever;

Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.'
:::

Therefore, 'the temple and the world stand in an intimate and intrinsic
connection. The two projects cannot ultimately be distinguished or
disengaged. Each recounts how God brought about an environment in which
he can rest' (Levenson 1984: 288).

Indeed, in addition to the clear affirmation of Psalm 132, there are
other Old Testament passages indicating that part of the purpose of the
temple is as a divine resting place. Among other references in this
respect are 1 Chronicles 28:2 (David intended 'to build a house of rest
for the ark . . . of the L[ORD]{.small}'), Isaiah 66:1 ('Where then is a
house you could build for Me?/And where is My resting place?'), 2
Chronicles 6:41 ('arise, O L[ORD]{.small} God, to Thy resting place,
Thou and the ark of Thy might'; cf. also the apocryphal Judith 9:8, 'Thy
sanctuary . . . the tabernacle where Thy glorious name
rests').[77](#appen11.html#NFIN80){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN80-1 .apnf}

God's rest both at the conclusion of creation in Genesis 1 -- 2 and
later in Israel's temple indicates not mere inactivity but that he had
demonstrated his sovereignty over the forces of chaos (e.g., the enemies
of Israel) and now has assumed a position of kingly rest further
revealing his sovereign power. Similarly, as we will also see below in
citations of the *Enuma Elish* and other sources, the building of a
shrine for divine rest occurs only after the powers of chaos have been
defeated.

Accordingly, it is likely not coincidental that David initially
conceived of building God a temple only after 'the L[ORD]{.small} had
given him rest on every side from all his enemies' (2 Sam. 7:1--6;
following Levenson 1988: 107). David prepares for the building of the
temple (1 Chr. 21:18 -- 29:30), but he does not construct it because he
had been 'a man of war' and had 'shed blood' (1 Chr. 22:8; 28:3);
furthermore, he did not build the temple because, while there was 'rest'
externally, there was still political unrest internally that needed to
be quelled before Solomon could assume the throne and then build the
temple (1 Kgs. 1 -- 2).

[]{#chap2.html#page_63}Consequently, Solomon decides to 'build a house
for the name of the L[ORD]{.small}' when he recognizes that 'now the
L[ORD]{.small} my God has given me rest on every side' (1 Kgs. 5:4--5;
so almost identically 1 Chr. 22:9--10, 18--19; 23:25--26; cf. 1 Kgs.
8:56). And, in fact, when God promises that Solomon 'will build a house
for My name', it is directly preceded and followed by the phrase 'I will
establish . . . his kingdom' (2 Sam. 7:12--13), thus underscoring the
close relation of temple building and complete sovereign rest as a
result of defeating all
enemies.[78](#appen11.html#NFIN81){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN81-1 .apnf}

Exodus 15:17 confirms this by saying that God would bring Israel to 'the
place, O L[ORD]{.small}, which Thou hast made for Thy dwelling, the
sanctuary, O L[ORD]{.small}, which Thy hands have established. *The LORD
shall reign forever and ever*.' God's dwelling in Israel's temple was
conceived as the rest of a divine king who had no worries about
opposition. God's *sitting* in the temple is an expression of his
sovereign rest or reign. This is underscored by the repeated phrase 'who
is enthroned above the cherubim' (2 Sam. 6:2; 2 Kgs. 19:15; 1 Chr. 13:6;
Pss. 80:1; 99:1), which includes reference to God's actual presence in
the temple as a reflection of his reign in the heavenly realm.
Psalm 99:1 even more clearly asserts, 'The L[ORD]{.small} reigns . . .
He is enthroned above the cherubim.' Just as God 'ascended and sat in
the heights of the universe \[to reign\]', after he completed the
creation (*The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan* 1), so he would ascend
to the temple and reign from there, after he subdued all Israel's
enemies (Levenson 1988:
108).[79](#appen11.html#NFIN82){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN82-1 .apnf} In like
manner, the repeated image of God 'sitting on a throne' is another
picture of the sovereign who is resting (the phrase occurs approximately
35 times in the Old Testament, usually with respect to Israel's human
kings; cf., e.g., Ps. 47:8: 'God reigns over the nations, God sits on
His holy throne').

### The Ancient Near Eastern concept of tabernacles in relation to temples, overcoming opposition and consequent divine 'rest' {.int_niv2}

With respect to the overcoming of opposition followed by
temple-building, the reason for the transition from Israel's tabernacle
to the []{#chap2.html#page_64}temple is important. It has become
apparent that the tabernacle was modelled for polemical purposes, at
least in part, on mobile Egyptian military tent camps that consisted of
almost exactly the same three-part structure with the same measurements
and that was oriented eastward (courtyard, inner reception area and the
innermost chamber, where an image of the divine Pharaoh was flanked by
two winged creatures!) There is even evidence that the Egyptian military
tent was surrounded by troops divided into four units similar to the
four distinct units of Israel's tribes that camped around the tabernacle
(Num. 2). Just as the divine Pharaoh led his army into battle, so
likewise did Yahweh, though he was the true god dwelling in his
tabernacle in contrast to Pharaoh's idolatrous tent. Therefore, Israel's
tabernacle may well have been conceived to be a travelling war
headquarters from where the Lord directed the troops until all
opposition was put
down.[80](#appen11.html#NFIN83){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN83-1 .apnf} When the
enemies are defeated, then a more permanent dwelling can be built to
signify God's sovereign 'resting' from opposition, as happened during
Solomon's reign.

### The Ancient Near Eastern concept of gods 'resting' after creating the world and the temple {.int_niv2}

Walton notes how well God's 'rest' in Israel's temple corresponds to the
purpose of temples in the Ancient Near East, which enhances the
conclusions of the preceding discussion. In particular, the *Enuma
Elish* narrates that the lack of rest among the gods results in a
battle. The 'higher' god Apsu complains to Tiamat about the lower gods:

::: cita
::: stroplg
Their ways have become very grievous to me,

By day I cannot rest, by night I cannot sleep.

I shall abolish their ways and disperse them.

Let peace prevail, so that we can sleep.

::: cita_source
(*Enuma Elish*
1.37--40)[81](#appen11.html#NFIN84){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN84-1 .apnf}
:::
:::

After defeating Tiamat, Marduk reorganizes the cosmos and the lesser
gods under his sovereignty, concluding with the building of Babylon
conceived as a shrine-like temple in which the gods can find rest:

::: cita
::: stroplg
[]{#chap2.html#page_65}We will make a shrine, which is to be called by
name

'Chamber that shall be Our Stopping Place,'

we shall find rest therein.

We shall lay out the shrine, let us set up its emplacement,

when we come thither . . . we shall find rest therein.

When Marduk heard this,

His features glowed brightly, like the day,

Then make Babylon the task that you requested,

Let its brickwork be formed, build high the shrine.
:::

::: cita_source
(*Enuma Elish*
6.51--58)[82](#appen11.html#NFIN85){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN85-1 .apnf}
:::
:::

Similarly, in the Sumerian narrative of Gudea's building a temple for
the god Ningirsu, the purpose of the temple was to establish a place of
rest for the god and his consort (Walton 2001:
151).[83](#appen11.html#NFIN86){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN86-1 .apnf} And when
the Sumerian god Ningirsu enters the temple built for him, he is
portrayed as a 'warrior' and 'king' (Cyl. B 5.1--19) (Averbeck 2000:
431). His majestic inactivity shows that the powers of chaos have been
ruled over, that stability in his kingdom has been achieved, and no
further exertion on his part is needed to achieve victory.

After the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses had built a temple for the god Ptah,
he made an image of the deity, set it in the most inner holy chamber,
and exclaimed that now the god was 'resting upon its \[the temple's\]
throne' (Breasted 1906: 3:181 §412). This theme occurs repeatedly in
Egypt.[84](#appen11.html#NFIN87){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN87-1 .apnf} Another
passage in the *Enuma Elish* (1.73--76) pertaining to divine rest, not
apparently noticed by commentators, explains that after the god Ea
defeats other divine opponents, he rests in a shrine:

::: stroplg
After Ea had vanquished (and) subdued his enemies,

Had established his victory over his foes,

(And) had peacefully rested in his abode,

He named it *Apsu* and appointed (it) for
shrines.[85](#appen11.html#NFIN88){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN88-1 .apnf}
:::

[]{#chap2.html#page_66}Similarly, another text (6.8, 35--36) in the same
work affirms that 'after Ea . . . had created mankind . . . they had
imposed the service of the gods upon them' for the purpose that the gods
'may be at rest'.

Consequently, 'in the Ancient Near East as in the Bible, temples are for
divine "rest", and divine rest is found in sanctuaries or sacred space'
(Walton 2001: 151).[86](#appen11.html#NFIN89){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN89-1
.apnf} The pagan religious material suggests further that after God
overcame chaos and created the world and after he overcame Israel's
enemies and built the temple, he 'rested' as a true sovereign on his
throne in contrast to the pretending, false deities whom pagan
worshippers believed had done the same.

## Israel's earthly tabernacle and temple as reflections and recapitulations of the first temple in the Garden of Eden {.int_niv1}

In addition to the notion that the earthly temple reflected the
heavenly, cosmic temple, Revelation 22:1ff. appears to be aware of an
earlier interpretation of Eden as a sanctuary. Following the lead of
John's allusion to Genesis 2 -- 3 that is woven into his depiction of
the city-temple, it will be instructive to go back and study this
beginning narrative of sacred history. Such a study will reveal hints
that the Garden of Eden was the first archetypal temple in which the
first man worshipped
God.[87](#appen11.html#NFIN90){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN90-1 .apnf}

### The Garden as the unique place of God's presence {.int_niv2}

Israel's temple was the place where the priest experienced God's unique
presence, and Eden was the place where Adam walked and talked with God.
The same Hebrew verbal form (stem) *mithallek* (hithpael) used for God's
'walking back and forth' in the Garden (Gen. 3:8), also describes God's
presence in the tabernacle (Lev. 26:12; Deut. 23:14 \[15\]; 2 Sam.
7:6--7).
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-014 .niv2}
### The Garden as the place of the first priest {.int_niv2}

Genesis 2:15 says God placed Adam in the Garden 'to cultivate \[i.e.,
work\] it and to keep it'. The two Hebrew words for 'cultivate and keep'
are usually translated 'serve and guard \[or keep\]' elsewhere in the
Old
[]{#chap2.html#page_67}Testament.[88](#appen11.html#NFIN91){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN91-1
.apnf} It is true that the Hebrew word usually translated 'cultivate'
can refer to an agricultural task when used by itself (e.g., 2:5; 3:23).
When, however, these two words (verbal \[*'ābad* and *šāmar*\] and
nominal forms) occur together in the Old Testament (within an
approximately 15-word range), they refer either to Israelites 'serving'
God and 'guarding \[keeping\]' God's word (approximately 10 times) or to
priests who 'keep' the 'service' (or 'charge') of the tabernacle (see
Num. 3:7--8; 8:25--26; 18:5--6; 1 Chr. 23:32; Ezek.
44:14).[89](#appen11.html#NFIN92){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN92-1 .apnf}

The Aramaic translation of Genesis 2:15 (*Tg. Neofiti*) underscores this
priestly notion of Adam, saying that he was placed in the Garden 'to
toil in the Law and to observe its commandments' (language strikingly
similar to the above Numbers' references; likewise *Tg. Pseudo-Jonathon
Genesis* 2:15). Verse 19 of this Aramaic translation also notes that in
naming the animals Adam used 'the language of the
sanctuary'.[90](#appen11.html#NFIN93){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN93-1 .apnf}
Later Jewish and early Christian tradition make affirmations consistent
with the notion that part of Adam's function was to worship
God.[91](#appen11.html#NFIN94){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN94-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap2.html#page_68}The best translation of Adam's task in Genesis
2:15 is 'to cultivate (work) it and to keep it \[the Garden\]'.
Regardless of the precise translation, however, the preceding
observations suggest that the writer of Genesis 2 was portraying Adam
against the later portrait of Israel's priests, and that he was the
archetypal priest who served in and guarded (or 'took care
of'[92](#appen11.html#NFIN95){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN95-1 .apnf}) God's
first temple.[93](#appen11.html#NFIN96){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN96-1 .apnf}
While it is likely that a large part of Adam's task was to 'cultivate'
and be a gardener as well as 'guarding' the garden, that all of his
activities are to be understood primarily as priestly activity is
suggested not only from the exclusive use of the two words in contexts
of worship elsewhere but also because the garden was a sanctuary, as we
will argue throughout this segment. If this is so, then the manual
labour of 'gardening' itself would be priestly activity, since it would
be maintaining the upkeep and order of the sanctuary.

After telling Adam to 'cultivate' and 'guard/keep' in Genesis 2:15, God
gives him a specific 'command' in verse 16. The notion of divine
'commanding' (*[ṣ]{.mev1}āwâ*) or giving of 'commandments'
(*mi[ṣ]{.mev1}wôt*) not untypically follows the word 'guard/keep'
(*šāmar*) elsewhere, and in 1 Kings 9:6, when both 'serving' and
'keeping' occur together, the idea of 'commandments to be kept' is in
view. The 1 Kings passage is addressed to Solomon and his sons
immediately after he had 'finished building the house of the
L[ORD]{.small}' (1 Kgs. 9:1): if they do 'not *keep* My commandments . .
. and *serve* other gods . . . I will cut off Israel from the land . . .
and the house \[temple\] . . . I will cast out of My sight' (1 Kgs.
9:6--7). Is this a mere coincidental connection with Genesis 2:15--16?

Hence, it follows naturally that after God puts Adam into the Garden for
'cultivating/serving and keeping/guarding' (v. 15) that in the very next
verse God would command Adam to keep a commandment: 'and the
L[ORD]{.small} God commanded the man . . .' The first 'torah' was that
'From any tree of the Garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that
you eat from it you shall surely die' (Gen. 2:16--17). Accordingly,
Adam's disobedience, as Israel's, results in his being cut
[]{#chap2.html#page_69}off from the sacred land of the Garden. This is
an indication that the task of Adam in Genesis 2:15 included more than
mere spadework in the dirt of a garden. It is apparent that priestly
obligations in Israel's later temple included the duty of 'guarding'
unclean things from entering (cf. Num. 3:6--7, 32, 38; 18:1--7), and
this appears to be relevant for Adam, especially in view of the unclean
creature lurking on the perimeter of the Garden and who then enters.
Interestingly, priests of ancient pagan temples were also to 'guard the
temple' and to kill
intruders,[94](#appen11.html#NFIN97){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN97-1 .apnf} as
well as 'guard' and pass on sacred texts (Finnestad 1997: 228).

Adam's priestly role of 'guarding' (*šāmar*) the garden sanctuary may
also be reflected in the later role of Israel's priests who were called
'guards' (1 Chr. 9:23) and repeatedly were referred to as temple
'gatekeepers' (repeatedly in 1 and 2 Chronicles and Nehemiah: e.g., 1
Chr. 9:17--27) who 'kept watch \[*šāmar*\] at the gates' (Neh. 11:19),
'so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean' (2 Chr. 23:19).
Consequently, the priestly role in both the Garden and later temple was
to 'manage' it by maintaining its order and keeping out uncleanness. The
picture is that of a 'warden' who 'keeps charge of the temple' (cf.
Ezek. 40:45; 44:14) or manages a sacred ward (indeed, the [AV]{.small}
of Neh. 12:45 says that temple priests '*kept* the *ward* of their
God').[95](#appen11.html#NFIN98){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN98-1 .apnf}

Interestingly, when the second temple is destroyed, the priests are
portrayed as saying to God, 'Guard your house yourself, because, behold,
we have been found to be false stewards' (*2 Baruch* 10:18; so also
*Midrash Rabbah Leviticus* 19:6). One early Jewish commentary summarizes
Adam's role accordingly: 'And you \[God\] said that you would make a man
for this world as a guardian over your \[God's\] works' (*2 Baruch*
14:18, apparently alluding to Gen. 2:15).

There may also be significance that the word used for God 'putting' Adam
'into the garden' in Genesis 2:15 is not the usual Hebrew word for 'put'
(*s´ûm*) but is the word typically translated as 'to rest' (*nûah*).
[]{#chap2.html#page_70}The selection of a word with overtones of 'rest'
may indicate that Adam was to begin to reflect the sovereign rest of God
discussed above and that he would achieve a consummate 'rest' after he
had faithfully performed his task of 'taking care of and guarding' the
garden. This is in line with the 'rest' that God promises later to
Israel if they live faithfully in the Promised Land (which, as we will
see, is repeatedly compared to the Garden of
Eden).[96](#appen11.html#NFIN99){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN99-1 .apnf} That
this verb (in its hiphil or hophal causative form) was intentionally
chosen is pointed to further by the observation that it is used
elsewhere to refer to the installation of sacred furniture (2 Chr. 4:8)
and divine images into temples (2 Kgs. 17:29; Zech. 5:5--11) and
especially of God's 'resting place' (so the noun form) in his heavenly
palace-temple (Ps. 132:7--8, 14; Is.
66:1).[97](#appen11.html#NFIN100){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN100-1 .apnf} Thus,
the implication may be that God places Adam into a royal temple to begin
to reign as his priestly vice-regent. In fact, Adam should always best
be referred to as a 'priest-king', since it is only after the 'fall'
that priesthood is separated from kingship, though Israel's
eschatological expectation is of a messianic priest-king (e.g., see
Zech. 6:12--13).
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-015 .niv2}
### The Garden as the place of the first guarding cherubim {.int_niv2}

When Adam failed to guard the temple by sinning and letting in a foul
serpent to defile the sanctuary, he lost his priestly role, and the
cherubim took over the responsibility of 'guarding' the Garden temple:
God 'stationed the cherubim . . . *to guard* the way to the tree of
life' (so Gen. 3:24; see also Ezek. 28:14,
16).[98](#appen11.html#NFIN101){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN101-1 .apnf} The
guarding function of the cherubim probably did not involve gardening but
keeping out the sinful and unclean, which suggests that Adam's original
role stated in Genesis 2:15 likely entailed much more than cultivating
the soil, but also 'guarding' the sacred space.

The guarding role of the cherubim plausibly became memorialized in the
tabernacle when God commanded Moses to make two statues of cherubim and
stationed them on either side of the 'ark of the
[]{#chap2.html#page_71}covenant' in the 'holy of holies' (Exod.
25:18--22). The same arrangement was also part of the design of
Solomon's temple (1 Kgs. 8:6--7). The reliefs of carved cherubim
together with ornamental palm trees and calyxes that were on the inner
walls of the holy place of Solomon's temple (1 Kgs. 6:29) and on its
doors (1 Kgs. 6:32--35) may also reflect the primeval cherubim whose
duty it was to patrol the entrance leading to 'the tree of life' (Ezek.
41:18 is even more explicit: at the entrance of and on the walls of the
holy place there were carved 'cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree
was between cherub and cherub'). This point becomes more significant if
our following point is viable: that the lampstand in the holy place was
intended to represent the ancient 'tree of
life'.[99](#appen11.html#NFIN102){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN102-1 .apnf}

### The Garden as the place of the first arboreal lampstand {.int_niv2}

The 'tree of life' itself is a good candidate to be considered as the
model for the lampstand placed directly outside the 'holy of
holies'.[100](#appen11.html#NFIN103){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN103-1 .apnf} The
lampstand in the tabernacle and temple looked like a small, flowering
tree with seven protruding branches from a central trunk, three on one
side and three on the other, and one branch going straight up from the
trunk in the middle. Exodus 25:31--36 pictures the lampstand having a
flowering and fructifying appearance of a tree with 'bulbs and flowers',
'branches', and 'almond blossoms' (likewise, Josephus, *Ant*. 3.145).

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-017 .niv2}
### The Garden as formative for garden imagery in Israel's temple {.int_niv2}

That the Garden of Eden was the first sacred space is also suggested by
observing that Solomon's temple was described with botanical and
arboreal imagery that gave it a garden-like appearance. The account in 1
Kings 6 -- 7 of the temple construction includes a proliferation of
garden-like descriptions of the interior, much of which are descriptions
of carvings, structures or pieces of furniture covered with precious
metals: wood-carved 'gourds and open flowers' (1 Kgs. 6:18), 'palm trees
and open flowers' (1 Kgs. 6:29, 32, twice mentioned), 'pomegranates
numbered two hundred in rows around both capitals' on the two doorway
pillars (1 Kgs. 7:20; cf. likewise, 7:18--19), on the top of which were
a 'lily design' (1 Kgs. 7:22); the bronze sea in the courtyard had two
rows of 'gourds' under its brim, which was 'made
[]{#chap2.html#page_72}. . . like a lily blossom' (1 Kgs. 7:24--26);
'four-hundred pomegranates' around the two capitals of the pillars
(1 Kgs. 7:42); ten (!) lampstands that were configured like trees with
blossoms (1 Kgs. 7:49), thus resembling a small orchard (note the later
*Testament of Adam* 4:7, which says that in Zech. 1:8--11 the prophet
saw 'trees' in the heavenly 'tabernacle'; cf. also Ps. 74:3--7 which
includes portrayal of a 'thicket of trees' in Israel's sanctuary; cf.
similarly *y. Yoma*
4:4).[101](#appen11.html#NFIN104){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN104-1 .apnf}

Accordingly, subsequent Old Testament literature identifies Solomon's
temple (Pss. 52:8; 92:13--15; Lam. 2:6) and Israel's eschatological
temple (Is. 60:13, 21) with a 'garden' or garden-like depictions in
order to identify them with
Eden.[102](#appen11.html#NFIN105){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN105-1 .apnf}
Appropriately, Solomon himself is portrayed as an Adamic figure, the
ideal botanist, who lectured about 'trees, from the cedar that is in
Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall' (1 Kgs. 4:33a).

### Eden as the first source of water {.int_niv2}

Just as a river flowed out from Eden (Gen. 2:10), so the post-exilic
temple (*Letter of Aristeas*, 89--91) and the eschatological temple in
both Ezekiel 47:1--12 and Revelation 21:1--2 have rivers flowing out
from their centre (and likewise Rev. 7:15--17 and probably Zech.
14:8--9).[103](#appen11.html#NFIN106){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN106-1 .apnf}
Indeed, Ezekiel generally depicts latter-day Mount Zion (and its temple)
with descriptions of Eden in an attempt to show that the promises
originally inherent in Eden would be realized in the fulfilment of his
vision (Levenson 1976: 25--53). Fertility and 'rivers' are also
descriptions of Israel's temple in Psalm 36:8--9:

::: stroplg
[]{#chap2.html#page_73}They drink their fill of the abundance of Thy
house \[temple\];

And Thou dost give them to drink of *the river of Thy*

*delights* \[literally, 'the river of your Edens'\].

For with Thee is *the fountain of
life*;[104](#appen11.html#NFIN107){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN107-1 .apnf}

In Thy light we see light \[perhaps a play of words on the light

from the lampstand in the holy place\].
:::

Jeremiah 17:7--8 also compares those 'whose trust is the L[ORD]{.small}'
to 'a tree planted by the water, that extends its roots by a stream',
with the result that 'its leaves will be green' and it will not 'cease
to yield fruit' (cf. also Ps. 1:2--3). Then verses 12--13 refer to 'the
place of our \[Israel's\] sanctuary' and virtually equates it with 'the
fountain of living water, even the
L[ORD]{.small}'.[105](#appen11.html#NFIN108){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN108-1
.apnf}

### The Garden as the place of precious stones {.int_niv2}

Genesis 2:12 says that 'good gold' and 'bdellium and onyx stone' were in
'the land of Havilah', apparently where Eden was or, at least, to which
it was close. Of course, various items of tabernacle furniture were made
of gold, as were the walls, ceiling and floor of the holy of holies in
Solomon's temple (1 Kgs. 6:20--22; for 'gold' in the tabernacle see
Exod. 25:11--39). Furthermore, the onyx stones decorated both the
tabernacle and temple, as well as the high priestly garments (Exod.
25:7; 28:9--12, 20; 1 Chr. 29:2). Gold and onyx are also found together
on the priest's clothing (Exod. 28:6--27) and are mentioned together as
composing parts of the temple (1 Chr. 29:2). Thus, the common feature of
precious stones further associates the Garden with the later temple.
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-020 .niv2}
### The Garden as the place of the first mountain {.int_niv2}

The prophet Ezekiel portrays Eden as being on a mountain (Ezek. 28:14,
16). Israel's temple was on Mount Zion (e.g., Exod. 15:17), and the
end-time temple was to be located on a mountain (Ezek. 40:2; 43:12; Rev.
21:10).
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-021 .niv2}
### The Garden as the first place of wisdom {.int_niv2}

The ark in the holy of holies, which contained the Law (that led to
wisdom), echoes the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (that also
[]{#chap2.html#page_74}led to wisdom). Both the touching of the ark and
the partaking of the tree's fruit resulted in death.
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-022 .niv2}
### The Garden as the first place with an eastern facing entrance {.int_niv2}

The entrance to Eden was from the east (Gen. 3:24), which was also the
direction from which one entered the tabernacle and later temples of
Israel, and would be the same direction from which the latter-day temple
would be entered (Ezek. 40:6).
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-023 .niv2}
### The Garden as part of a tripartite sacred structure {.int_niv2}

It may even be discernible that there was a sanctuary and a holy place
in Eden corresponding roughly to that in Israel's later temple. The
Garden should be viewed as not itself the source of water but adjoining
Eden because Genesis 2:10 says, 'a river flowed out of Eden to water the
garden'.

Therefore, in the same manner that ancient palaces were adjoined by
gardens, 'Eden is the source of the waters and \[is the palatial\]
residence of God, and the garden adjoins God's
residence.'[106](#appen11.html#NFIN109){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN109-1 .apnf}
Similarly, Ezekiel 47:1 says that water would flow out from under the
holy of holies in the future eschatological temple and would water the
earth around. Similarly, in the end-time temple of Revelation 22:1--2
there is portrayed 'a river of the water of life . . . coming *from the
throne of God and of the Lamb*' and flowing into a garden-like grove,
which has been modelled on the first paradise in Genesis 2, as has been
much of Ezekiel's portrayal.

If Ezekiel and Revelation are developments of the first garden-temple,
which we will argue later is the case, then Eden, the area where the
source of water is located, may be comparable to the inner sanctuary of
Israel's later temple and the adjoining garden to the holy
place.[107](#appen11.html#NFIN110){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN110-1 .apnf} Even
aside from these later biblical texts, Eden and its adjoining garden
formed two distinct regions. This is compatible with our further
identification of the lampstand in the holy place of the temple with the
tree of life located in the fertile plot outside the inner place of
God's presence. Additionally, 'the bread of the presence', also in the
holy place, which provided food for the priests, would
[]{#chap2.html#page_75}appear to reflect the food produced in the Garden
for Adam's sustenance (Walton 2001: 182).

I would add to this that the land and seas to be subdued by Adam outside
the Garden were roughly equivalent to the outer court of Israel's
subsequent temple, which would lend further confirmation to the above
identification of Israel's temple courtyard being symbolic of the land
and seas throughout the
earth.[108](#appen11.html#NFIN111){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN111-1 .apnf} Thus,
one may be able to perceive an increasing gradation in holiness from
outside the garden proceeding inward: the region outside the garden is
related to God and is 'very good' (Gen. 1:31) in that it is God's
creation (= the outer court); the garden itself is a sacred space
separate from the outer world (= the holy place), where God's priestly
servant worships God by obeying him, by cultivating and guarding; Eden
is where God dwells (= the holy of holies) as the source of both
physical and spiritual life (symbolized by the waters).
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-024 .niv2}
### Ezekiel's view of the Garden of Eden as the first sanctuary {.int_niv2}

In the light of these numerous conceptual and linguistic parallels
between Eden and Israel's tabernacle and temple, it should not be
unexpected to find that Ezekiel 28:13--14, 16, 18 refer to 'Eden, the
garden of God . . . the holy mountain of God', and also alludes to it as
containing 'sanctuaries', which elsewhere is a plural way of referring
to Israel's tabernacle (Lev. 21:23) and temple (Ezek. 7:24; so also Jer.
51:51). The plural reference to the one temple probably arose because of
the multiple sacred spaces or 'sanctuaries' within the temple complex
(e.g., courtyard, holy place, holy of
holies).[109](#appen11.html#NFIN112){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN112-1 .apnf} It
is also probable that the Greek Old Testament version of Ezekiel 28:14
and 16 views the glorious being who had 'fallen' to be Adam: 'From the
day that you were created you were with the cherub' (v. 14); 'you
sinned; therefore, you have been cast down wounded from the mount of God
\[where Eden was\]' (v. 16). Ezekiel 28:13 pictures Adam dressed in
bejewelled clothing like a priest (28:13), which corresponds well to the
reference only five verses later to Eden as a holy sanctuary. Ezekiel
28:18 is probably, therefore, the most explicit place
[]{#chap2.html#page_76}anywhere in canonical literature where the Garden
of Eden is called a
temple.[110](#appen11.html#NFIN113){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN113-1 .apnf}
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-025 .niv2}
### The Ancient Near Eastern concept of temples in association with garden-like features {.int_niv2}

Gardens not untypically were part of temple complexes in the Ancient
Near East (Stager 1999: 193). For example, Ramses III of Egypt created
'gardens' in the deity's 'house' (Breasted 1906: 4:148 §274) and 'made
to grow the pure grove of thy \[the deity's\] temple . . . with
gardeners to cultivate it . .
.'[111](#appen11.html#NFIN114){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN114-1 .apnf}

The earlier-mentioned elements of a garden-like atmosphere, rivers and
precious stones in common between Eden and Israel's temple occur also in
the Ancient Near East. There one can find the combined mention of a
temple, trees, rivers, subterranean waters, jewels and divine activity
as a description of one cultic place. An apt example comes from a
Sumerian-Akkadian text:

::: cita
In Eridu the black tragacanth tree grew in a pure place it was created.
Its appearance is lapis lazuli stretched out on the Apsu \[fresh water
or sea\] of \[the god\] Ea-his promenade in Eridu filled with abundance
. . . its shrine is the bed of Nammu. In the holy temple in which like a
forest it casts its shadow, into which no one has entered, in its midst
are \[the gods\] Shamash and Tammuz, in between the mouths of the two
rivers.[112](#appen11.html#NFIN115){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN115-1 .apnf}
:::

This ancient pagan text shows that Ancient Near Eastern gods were also
conceived of as dwelling in watery abodes or at the source
[]{#chap2.html#page_77}of headwaters from which fertile areas were
watered: the gods Shamash and Tammuz dwelt in the 'midst' of 'the holy
temple' 'in between the mouths of the two rivers'. The Canaanite god El
is also a good example of this (see Walton 2001: 167): the god's
permanent 'tent' dwelling was at 'the headwaters of the Euphrates
River'.[113](#appen11.html#NFIN116){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN116-1 .apnf}

A further observation can be made with particular reference to common
tree-like images in both Eden and Israel's temple. In the light of
Mesopotamian,
Assyrian,[114](#appen11.html#NFIN117){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN117-1 .apnf}
Egyptian, Persian[115](#appen11.html#NFIN118){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN118-1
.apnf} and
Syro-Phoenician[116](#appen11.html#NFIN119){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN119-1
.apnf} evidence about columns in ancient buildings and temples having a
tree-like appearance, the two large columns at the outer porch of the
holy place, perhaps represented giant trees, since, as we saw above,
they were ornamented with vegetation (clusters of pomegranates and
lilies at the top). Possibly, they corresponded to the two well-known
trees of 'life' and 'knowledge' in the Garden of
Eden.[117](#appen11.html#NFIN120){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN120-1 .apnf} The
Sumerian *Keš Temple Hymn* depicts the temple not only as 'green in its
fruit' but also 'a boxwood tree bearing its crown to the sky, like a
poplar . . . like the Mountain, green as the sky' (Sjöberg et al. 1969:
169, 171, lines 40, 67--69).

Possibly, these affinities between Eden and pagan garden-like divine
dwellings were intended to indicate that God's depiction in Eden is a
polemic against the similar depiction of pagan gods. More precisely, the
polemical force may focus on the original description of the first
garden-like temple for the true God, of which the pagan versions are
faint imitations.

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-026 .niv2}
### Early Judaism's view of the garden as the first sanctuary {.int_niv2}

Judaism in various ways also understood the Garden to be the first
sanctuary in line with the above Old Testament evidence. Comment has
already been made on a little of this evidence in the preceding
paragraphs.

First, Adam was considered to be a priest, serving God in the sanctuary
of Eden. The book of *Jubilees* (160 [BC]{.small}) represents an early
Jewish interpretation of Adam as a priest in an arboreal temple. When he
was cast out of the garden, he offered the sweet savoury offering
[]{#chap2.html#page_78}(composed of the very same elements used only in
the later temple) that he apparently had formerly been offering
(*Jubilees* 3:27). *Jubilees* 4:23--25 likewise portrays Enoch offering
'the incense which is acceptable . . . in the evening (at) the holy
place', after he was caught up 'into the Garden of Eden'. Rabbinic
interpretation also links Adam's expulsion from the garden to being cast
out of the temple and to the destruction of Israel's later temple
(*Midrash Rabbah Genesis*
21:8).[118](#appen11.html#NFIN121){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN121-1 .apnf}

Perhaps the earliest (160 [BC]{.small}) and clearest example of
Judaism's identification of Eden as a sanctuary is *Jubilees* 8:19: 'And
he \[Noah\] knew that the Garden of Eden was the holy of holies and the
dwelling of the Lord. And Mount Sinai (was) in the midst of the desert
and Mount Zion was in the midst of the navel of the earth. The three of
these were created as holy places, one facing the other.' This is quite
interesting because it links the Garden as a temple with, not only
Sinai, but also the temple in Jerusalem. *Testament of Levi* 18:6, 10
and *1 Enoch* 24 -- 27 also closely associate God's temple with imagery
of the Garden of
Eden.[119](#appen11.html#NFIN122){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN122-1 .apnf}

Similarly striking is the Qumran community's identification of itself as
the 'Temple of Adam \[or Temple of Humankind\]' (*miqdaš
'ādām*[120](#appen11.html#NFIN123){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN123-1 .apnf} in
4QFlor 1, 6, referring to a future time in the community's history) and
'an Eden of glory \[bearing\] fruits \[of life\]' (1QH 8.20, though cf.
8.4--23).[121](#appen11.html#NFIN124){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN124-1 .apnf}
Similarly, 1QS 8.5 identifies the community as 'the House of holiness
for Israel' and 'the company of the Holy of Holies for Aaron' and 'an
everlasting planting', the latter a reference to the Garden of
Eden.[122](#appen11.html#NFIN125){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN125-1 .apnf}
Another Dead Sea Scroll text (4Q418, frag. 81 = 4Q423 8 + 24?) refers to
Adam's descendants who, in contrast to him, will obey and walk in an
'eter\[nal\] plantation' (lines 13--14). They will serve him 'by
consecrating yourself to him, in accordance to the fact that he has
placed you as a Holy of Holies []{#chap2.html#page_79}\[over
all\][123](#appen11.html#NFIN126){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN126-1 .apnf} the
earth, and over all the angels . . .' (line 4). This passage closely
associates a cultivated garden-like plot of land with those who dwell in
it, who have been placed there as a 'holy of holies' and who are to
extend their holy sphere over all the earth.

Early Jewish commentators also compared either the tree of life with
Israel's temple or Eden with the later lampstand. The early Jewish book
of *1 Enoch* says the tree of life would be transplanted from Eden,
which was on a 'high mountain', to the 'Holy Place beside the temple of
the Lord' in Jerusalem (*1 Enoch* 24 -- 25), implying that the tree's
former location in Eden was also a
sanctuary.[124](#appen11.html#NFIN127){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN127-1 .apnf}
This also comes close to identifying the tree with the lampstand that
was also in the 'Holy Place'. The Qumran *Hymn Scroll* makes a similar
identification: 'I will shine with a *seven-fold li* \[*ght*\] in the
*E* \[*den*[125](#appen11.html#NFIN128){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN128-1 .apnf}
which\] Thou has \[m\]ade for Thy glory' (1QH 7.24, my italics). The
righteous person of Qumran is compared to the seven lamps of the
lampstand shining in the Garden of Eden.

Jewish sources also associate the precious stones in Havilah, where Eden
was or was near, with Israel's later priests and
temple.[126](#appen11.html#NFIN129){#chap2.html#ap_NFIN129-1 .apnf}
:::

::: {#chap2.html#niv2-027 .niv2}
### Conclusion {.int_niv2}

The cumulative effect of the preceding parallels between the Garden of
Genesis 2 and Israel's tabernacle and temple indicates that Eden
[]{#chap2.html#page_80}was the first archetypal temple, upon which all
of Israel's temples were based. Some of the similarities drawn may not
be as strong as others, but when all are viewed together they have a
significant collective effect, pointing to Eden as the first temple in
garden-like form. We are not left, however, with a collection of
similarities that show how comparable Eden is to a temple. Indeed,
Ezekiel 28 explicitly calls Eden the first sanctuary, which
substantiates that Eden is described as a temple because it is the first
temple, albeit a 'garden-temple'. Early Judaism confirms this
identification. Indeed, it is probable that even the similar Ancient
Near Eastern temples can trace their roots back to the original primeval
garden.

## Humanity's kingly and priestly role in serving God in the temple {.int_niv1}

It is particularly interesting that among the preceding cultic
affinities drawn between Eden and Israel's temple was the observation
that the word-pair usually translated as 'cultivate' (*'ābad*) and
'keep' (*šāmar*) occur together in the Old Testament elsewhere referring
only either to Israelites 'serving' God and 'guarding' (keeping) God's
word (approximately 10 times), or to priests who 'keep' the 'service'
(or 'charge') of the tabernacle (5 times). Genesis 1 -- 2 not only
portrays Adam as a kingly gardener and watchman but does so in language
that rings with the notion of worshipful obedience. Consequently, we
concluded in the last chapter that Adam is being portrayed as a priest
in this task.

## The cosmic expansion of the garden sanctuary through Adam's rule as a priest-king in God's image {.int_niv1}

Not only was Adam to serve as a priest-king in the initial stage of the
Edenic sanctuary, but Genesis 1:28 affirms that he was also to subdue
the entire earth: 'And God blessed them . . . "Be fruitful and multiply,
and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and
over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the
earth."' Genesis 1:27 provides the means by which the commission and
goal of verse 28 was to be accomplished: humanity will fulfil the
commission by means of being in God's
image.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN130){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN130-1 .apnf} They
were to reflect God's kingship by being his vice-regents on earth.
Because Adam and Eve were to subdue and rule 'over all the earth', it is
plausible to suggest that they were to extend the geographical
boundaries of the []{#chap3.html#page_82}garden until Eden covered the
whole earth.[2](#appen11.html#NFIN131){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN131-1 .apnf}
They were on the primeval hillock of hospitable Eden, outside of which
lay the inhospitable land. They were to extend the smaller liveable area
of the garden by transforming the outer chaotic region into a habitable
territory.

In actuality, Adam, as God's vice-regent, and his progeny were to put
'the finishing touches' on the world God created in Genesis 1 by making
it a liveable place for humans. The penultimate goal of the Creator was
to make creation a liveable place for humans in order that they would
achieve the grand aim of glorifying him. This penultimate goal of making
the whole earth habitable would appear to be confirmed by Isaiah 45:18:
'God . . . formed the earth and made it . . . and did not create it a
waste place, but formed it *to be inhabited*' (likewise cf. Ps. 115:16).
God's ultimate goal in creation was to magnify his glory throughout the
earth by means of his faithful image-bearers inhabiting the world in
obedience to the divine mandate.

As we will see below, this is consistent with the notion in Babylonian
and Egyptian tradition of people being created to serve their god in a
temple and extend that god's glorious light by building more temples or
widening the borders of an original temple. In Adam's case, however, it
is more probable that he was to spread God's luminescent presence by
extending the boundaries of the original Edenic temple outward into the
earth. Furthermore, in contrast to Ancient Near Eastern accounts, God
did not create Adam and Eve because he was tired of the drudgery of
providing for himself, but that humanity would reflect his glorious
image in extending his sacred presence outward into the wider regions of
the earth (Walton 2001: 186).

In this regard, Genesis 1:26--27 says four times that God made Adam in
his 'image' or 'likeness', and Genesis 2 says God placed him into the
garden-like sanctuary. Ancient kings would set up images of themselves
in distant lands over which they ruled in order to represent their
sovereign presence. For example, after conquering a new territory, the
Assyrian king Shalmanesar 'fashioned a mighty image of my majesty' that
he 'set up' on a black obelisk, and then he virtually equates his
'image' with that of 'the glory of Assur' his god (Frankfort 1954: 90
and plate 93). Likewise, Adam was created as the image of the divine
king to indicate that earth was ruled over by Yahweh (von Rad 1962:
146--147). In the light of Genesis 1:26--28, []{#chap3.html#page_83}this
meant the presence of God, which was initially to be limited to the
garden temple of Eden, was to be extended throughout the whole earth by
his image bearers, as they themselves represented and reflected his
glorious presence and attributes.

The following parallels from Assyria and Egypt (discussed below) show
that typically images of gods were placed in the god's temple and that
kings were viewed as living images of a god. Against this background and
in the light of Genesis 1:26--28, Adam's commission to 'cultivate' (with
connotations of 'serving') and 'guard' in Genesis 2:15 as a priest-king
is probably part of the commission given in
1:26--28[3](#appen11.html#NFIN132){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN132-1 .apnf}
Hence, Genesis 2:15 continues the theme of subduing and filling the
earth by humanity created in the divine
image.[4](#appen11.html#NFIN133){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN133-1 .apnf} This
'ruling' and 'ubduing' 'over all the earth' is plausibly part of a
functional definition of the divine image in which Adam was made, though
there is likely an additional ontological aspect of the 'image' by which
humanity was enabled to reflect the functional
image.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN134){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN134-1 .apnf} Just as
God, after his initial work of creation, subdued the chaos, ruled over
it and further created and filled the earth with all kinds of animate
life, so Adam and Eve, in their garden abode, were to reflect God's
activities in Genesis 1 by fulfilling the commission to 'subdue' and
'rule over all the earth' and to 'be fruitful and multiply' (Gen. 1:26,
28).[6](#appen11.html#NFIN135){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN135-1 .apnf}

In the light of the above, one can conclude that Adam's kingly and
priestly activity in the garden was to be a beginning fulfilment of the
commission in 1:28 and was not to be limited to the garden's original
earthly boundaries but was to be extended over the whole world. In
particular, for example, Adam's speaking and naming of the animals (Gen.
2:19) expresses part of his rule over the creation and reflects God's
naming of parts of creation in Genesis 1 through his creative
speech.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN136){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN136-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap3.html#page_84}Similarly, that Adam and Eve were to become 'one
flesh' in 2:24 is certainly part of the beginning of the commission to
be 'fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth', further underscoring
that humanity's function in the image of God as 'male and female' (Gen.
1:27)[8](#appen11.html#NFIN137){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN137-1 .apnf} was to
be extended until the earth was filled with people performing this
function. Accordingly, a significant increase in population would
necessitate an expansion of the original sacred habitable dwelling of
the first primal
couple.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN138){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN138-1 .apnf} In
this regard, Matthew 19:4--6 (= Mark 10:6--9) is one of the earliest
texts relating Genesis 1:27 to Adam and Eve in
Eden:[10](#appen11.html#NFIN139){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN139-1 .apnf}

::: cita
^4^And He \[Jesus\] answered and said, 'Have you not read, that He who
created them from the beginning made them male and female \[Gen. 1:27\],
^5^and said, "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother,
and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh"?
\[Gen. 2:24\] ^6^'Consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh.
What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.'
:::

Jesus identifies humans as 'male and female' in the image of God (Gen.
1:27) who were to begin to fulfil their commission in the Garden by
maintaining their unity. Reproducing offspring in God's image is a
natural implication of the first couple's unity.

John Walton, I have found, corroborates this link between Genesis
1:26--28 and Genesis 2:15ff., contending that Adam was much more than a
gardener but was to maintain the created order of the sacred space of
the sanctuary. He also concludes that such maintenance indicates that
the 'cultivating' and 'guarding' of Genesis 2:15 is an expression of the
'subduing and ruling' of chapter 1 (Walton 2001:
174).[11](#appen11.html#NFIN140){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN140-1 .apnf}

Consequently, as observed earlier, Adam's priestly role in the
[]{#chap3.html#page_85}Garden was to 'manage' or 'care' for it by
maintaining its order and keeping out uncleanness. This included
'gardening' but likely went beyond it to managing the affairs of the
sacred place where God's presence dwelt and maintaining its orderliness
in contrast to the disordered space outside. This management included
'guarding' Eden from the threat of unclean things entering into it and
corrupting it. And would not this management also logically include
Adam's teaching of God's Law (from Gen. 2:16--17) to Eve in order that
they both would help one another to obey, so that spiritual chaos might
not set in? The picture, therefore, is that of a 'warden' managing a
sacred ward. As the first couple had children, it is certainly plausible
to suggest that the management of the Garden extended to teaching them
God's Law and serving God by obeying it. Furthermore, Walton observes
that

::: cita
if people were going to fill the earth \[according to Genesis 1\], we
must conclude that they were not intended to stay in the garden in a
static situation. Yet moving out of the garden would appear a hardship
since the land outside the garden was not as hospitable as that inside
the garden (otherwise the garden would not be distinguishable). Perhaps,
then, we should surmise that people were gradually supposed to extend
the garden as they went about subduing and ruling. Extending the garden
would extend the food supply as well as extend sacred space (since that
is what the garden represented). (2001: 186)
:::

The intention seems to be that Adam was to widen the boundaries of the
Garden in ever increasing circles by extending the order of the garden
sanctuary into the inhospitable outer
spaces.[12](#appen11.html#NFIN141){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN141-1 .apnf} The
outward expansion would include the goal of spreading the glorious
presence of God. This would occur especially by Adam's progeny born in
his image and thus reflecting God's image and the light of his presence,
as they continued to obey the mandate given to their parents and went
out to subdue the outer country. The original purpose of an expanding
Eden will be supported by our next chapter which will be exclusively
dedicated to tracing other passages primarily in the Old Testament and,
secondarily, in early Judaism, both of which interpret the Garden in
this manner.

[]{#chap3.html#page_86}The psalmist, commenting on the purpose of Adam
and humanity in Psalm 8, also indicates that the ultimate goal of
humanity was to fill the whole earth with God's glory. The psalm begins
in verse 1 and concludes in verse 9 with the same stated goal: 'O
L[ORD]{.small}, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth.'
This 'majesty' is God's glorious 'splendor' (cf. v. 1). The goal of
divine splendour is to be achieved 'in all the earth' by humanity whom
God 'has crowned with glory and majesty' by making him in his image (v.
5). In particular, Psalm 8 says God's glory is to be spread throughout
the earth by humanity 'ruling' over all 'the works of Thy \[God's\]
hands' (vv. 6--8). Included in this rule was making 'the enemy and
revengeful cease' (v. 2), which the Aramaic translation of the psalm
identifies with the 'author of enmity', the devil.

Genesis 1:28 is best taken as a command, possibly with an implied
promise that God will provide the ability to humanity to carry it
out.[13](#appen11.html#NFIN142){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN142-1 .apnf} A
medieval rabbinic commentary expresses well the aspect of 'mandate'
involved in the verse:

::: cita
the rationale of the commandment is that the world should be settled,
because God . . . desires its settlement, as it is written, 'He did not
create it a waste but formed it for habitation' \[Is. 45:18\]. And this
is a great commandment for whose sake there []{#chap3.html#page_87}exist
all of the other commandments, for they were given to human beings and
not to the ministering angels . . . And he who does not fulfill it
annuls a positive commandment . . . because he himself demonstrates that
he does not wish to fulfill God's desire to settle his world (Sefer
ha-Hinnukh).[14](#appen11.html#NFIN143){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN143-1 .apnf}
:::

Adam, however, failed in the task with which he was commissioned, which
includes permitting entrance into the Garden to an antagonistic and
unclean being. Though Genesis 2 -- 3 does not explicitly say that Adam's
'ruling and subduing' task was to guard the garden from the satanic
snake, our overall discussion so far in this chapter together with the
conclusion of the preceding chapter points to this (see Kline 1989:
54--55, 65--67). Thus, Adam did not guard the Garden but allowed
entrance to a foul snake that brought sin, chaos and disorder into the
sanctuary and into Adam and Eve's lives. He allowed the Serpent to 'rule
over' him rather than 'ruling over' it and casting it out of the Garden.
Rather than extending the divine presence of the garden sanctuary, Adam
and Eve were expelled from it. Consequently, Adam and Eve disobey God's
mandate in Genesis 1:28 (and, if 1:28 includes an implicit promise to
provide them ability to obey, it is not fulfilled).

## The Ancient Near Eastern concept of the cosmic expansion of temples through the rule of priest-kings in the image of a deity {.int_niv1}

As we commented in the last chapter, it should not be surprising to find
some parallels to biblical ideas in the literature of ancient cultures
surrounding Israel. The biblical writers were sometimes aware of the
ideas reflected in this literature and sometimes intentionally presented
their versions as the true ones in contrast and even contradiction to
the others. The narrative of creation, especially the creation of
humanity, would have been a prime place to point out the unique witness
of biblical revelation. On the other hand, the very fact that this
revelation is being set against the same general pagan conceptions means
that there will also be some similarities between the two
[]{#chap3.html#page_88}which mutually interpret one another. And, as we
have noted earlier, the fact that unbelieving humanity is still in the
image of God, distorted as that image is, indicates that their
conceptions about the nature of deity and of humanity contains some
truth. That unregenerate humanity can still have some glimmers of such
truths is part of God's grace in natural revelation (e.g., see Rom.
1:20, in the context of idolatry).

For example, the notion that Adam was set in a sanctuary as a royal
'image' of his God is an ancient concept found even outside Israel. The
following examples of this show how natural it is that images of a god
are placed in a temple after it has been
constructed.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN144){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN144-1 .apnf}
Ashurbanipal II (883--859 [BC]{.small}) 'created an icon of the goddess
Ishtar . . . from the finest stones, fine gold . . . (thus) making her
great divinity resplendent', and he 'set up in (the temple) her dais
\[throne platform\] (with the icon) for eternity (Grayson 1996:
296--297).' The resplendent glory of the image was to reflect the
luminescent glory of the goddess herself. Accordingly, the light of the
deity was to shine out from the temple into the faces of humanity.
Consequently, the idols in Assyria were made of precious metals in order
to reflect the heavenly glory of the god they
Represented.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN145){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN145-1 .apnf}

We have already had occasion to observe that Pharaoh Seti I (1302--1290
[BC]{.small}) built for the underworld god Osiris 'a temple like heaven;
its divine ennead are like the stars in it; its radiance is in the faces
(of men) like the horizon of Re rising therein at early
morning'.[17](#appen11.html#NFIN146){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN146-1 .apnf} The
Egyptians believed that the sun god, Re, would empower other lesser
deities to enter stone images placed in temples (Budge 1951: 164--166).
Accordingly, an inscription from the Pyramid Age affirms that the
Creator Ptah 'fashioned the \[lesser\] gods . . . He installed the gods
in their holy places . . . he equipped their holy places. He made
likenesses of their bodies . . . Then the gods entered into their bodies
of every wood and every stone and every metal' (Breasted 1959:
46).[18](#appen11.html#NFIN147){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN147-1 .apnf} Ramses
III (1195--1164 [BC]{.small}) said that in the temple of the sun god,
Re, he 'fashioned the gods in their mysterious forms of gold, silver,
and every costly stone . . .' (Breasted 1906: 4:143
§250).[19](#appen11.html#NFIN148){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN148-1 .apnf}
Indeed, 'the King []{#chap3.html#page_89}is a sacred image, the most
sacred of the sacred images of the Great One . . .' (Faulkner 1969: 82
\[Utterances 273--274, §407\]).

The Egyptian king is not merely a 'sacred image' of the deity (Faulkner
1969: 82), but he is a *living* image of the
god.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN149){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN149-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, other Egyptian texts say that the god 'Horus has acted on
behalf of his spirit in you \[the Pharaoh\]' (Faulkner 1969: 122
\[Utterance 370, §647\]), and one king is recorded as saying, 'I am the
essence of a god, the son of a god, the messenger of a god' (Faulkner
1969: 160 \[Utterance 471,
§920\]).[21](#appen11.html#NFIN150){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN150-1 .apnf}
Perhaps most striking, because of its similarity to Genesis 1:26, is the
statement by Ramses II (1290--1224 [BC]{.small}) about his relationship
to his god:[22](#appen11.html#NFIN151){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN151-1 .apnf}
'I am thy son whom thou hast placed upon thy throne. Thou hast assigned
to me thy kingdom, thou hast fashioned me in thy likeness and thy form,
which thou hast assigned to me and has created' (Breasted 1906: 3:181
§411). In addition, Ramses II was even to build temples for the gods:
the creator god Ptah said to the same Pharaoh, 'thou buildest their
\[the lesser gods\] holy places . . .' (1906: 3:179 §406). In this task,
as well as others in relation to the temple, the Egyptian king also
served as a priest performing rituals (Shafer 1997: 22--23; Finnestad
1997: 229). In the context of an inscription about a temple for the god
Amun, the god is recorded as calling the king Amenhotep 'My son . . . My
living image' (Lichtheim 1976: 46).

The Genesis portrayal of humans being created in the image of God and
being placed in the sanctuary of Eden is even generally in line with the
Ancient Near Eastern practice in which images of the god were placed in
a *garden-like* temple. There is a fascinating parallel from
Mesopotamia, where 'the creation, animation and installation of divine
images followed a strictly specified set of rites' (Beckerleg 1999:
310). A series of rituals were acted out in the workshop of a craftsman,
at a riverbank, in an arboreal garden and finally, in a temple. Through
the rituals the inert image of a god was born, brought to life, clothed
and changed into a living manifestation of the god. The image was then
installed in a temple. Likewise, God formed Adam in his 'workshop' (Gen.
2:7a), he was transmuted into a living person by God's breath (Gen.
2:7b), and was fully brought to life (Gen. 2:7c). Next, he was installed
in the Garden (Gen. 2:15) (Beckerleg 1999: 310). Such a background
suggests further that []{#chap3.html#page_90}Adam was a living 'image'
of the true God, not of a false pagan deity and, as such, was placed
into the garden temple.

As an image of the true God, in contrast to Ancient Near Eastern
priest-kings, Adam's royal and priestly service in the Eden temple and
his temple-expanding task also find further striking parallel in Ancient
Near Eastern literature. Again, these similarities are only imperfect
shadows of the genuine task described in Genesis 1 -- 2. With regard to
Adam's role as a human priest-king, the notion of a human king created
for the purpose of serving gods in a temple appears in an Akkadian
prayer employed in dedicating the foundation stone of a temple:

::: cita
::: stroplg
When Anu, Enlil and Ea had a first idea of heaven and earth,

They found a wise means of providing support for the gods:

They prepared, in the land, a pleasant dwelling,

And the gods were installed in this dwelling: their principal temple.

Then they entrusted to the king the responsibility

of assuring them their regular choice offerings.

And for the feast of the gods, they established the

required food offering!

The gods loved this dwelling!
:::

::: cita_source

The Babylonian *Enuma Elish* asserts that Marduk would 'create Man!
(Upon him) shall the services of the gods be
imposed'[23](#appen11.html#NFIN152){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN152-1 .apnf}
(6.7--8; twice more in the immediate context it is said that Ea 'had
created mankind' and 'imposed the services of the gods upon them that
they may be at rest' \[6.33--36\]) (Heidel 1942: 46). Such 'services'
most likely are conceived of as being performed within the gods' temple,
since the 'service' enables the gods to be at 'rest', a rest that we
have seen occurs uniquely in a temple (on which see the above discussion
of *Enuma Elish* 6.51--58). Another cosmological Akkadian text affirms
that Ea 'created the king, for the mainten\[ance of the temples\]; \[He
created\] mankind for the doi\[ng of the service of the gods
(?)\].'[24](#appen11.html#NFIN153){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN153-1 .apnf} A
similar passage says, 'let us create mankind. The service of the gods be
their []{#chap3.html#page_91}portion.' Then the kind of 'service'
humanity is to perform is explained:

::: cita
::: stroplg
To place the hoe and the basket

Which is fit to be an exalted sanctuary,

To mark off field from field . . .

To make the field of the Anunnaki produce plentifully,

To increase the abundance in the land . . .

To pour out cold water

In the great house of the gods, which is fit to be an exalted sanctuary.
:::

::: cita_source
(Heidel 1942: 69--70)
:::
:::

This text may refer to agricultural work within a temple or to an actual
construction of a temple. The former appears to be the case because 'the
exalted sanctuary' is in existence before humanity's creation (1942: 69,
line 10) and because the directly following context of the quotation
describes only horticultural tasks. It is not clear whether humanity
performs this 'service' both inside and outside the sanctuary, or
whether the whole earth is considered a sanctuary in which the work on
earth is performed. If the latter, the service in the sanctuary is to be
performed throughout the entire earth. If the former, the work on earth
is in some way inextricably linked with service in the sanctuary. Thus,
these Babylonian texts provide background consistent with the notion
that Adam's agricultural role in Eden, as the first human, was a kingly
and priestly function associated with service in a temple.

A similar text to the preceding, again from the Babylonian *Enuma Elish*
(6.107--130), clarifies that cultic 'service' in an initial sanctuary
was to be widened to include 'service' within other sanctuary-shrines
throughout the land and likely beyond:

::: stroplg
Let him \[Marduk\] exercise shepherdship over mankind, \[his\]
crea\[tures(?)\].

Let them provide for their maintenance (and) let them take care of their
sanctuaries . . .

[]{#chap3.html#page_92}A likeness of what he made (?) in heaven \[let
him make (?)\] on earth.

Let him teach mankind to fear him (?).

Let the subjects be ever mindful of their god (and) their goddess . . .

Let offerings be brought for their god and goddess;

Let their god not be forgotten, (but) let them support (him).

Let them make their land shine by building shrines for themselves.

Let mankind stand (in awe) before our god . . .

Let his ways shine forth in glory . . .

In the brightness of his \[Marduk's\] bright light let them walk about
constantly.

(upon) the people, whom he created . . .

He imposed the services of the gods . . .
:::

Not only was humanity's 'temple service' to extend beyond only one
sanctuary-shrine to others but, as this occurred, the glorious light of
the god would shine forth further because the human servants continued
to perform their cultic tasks in 'fear' of and faithfully in the
presence of their god.

Perhaps not coincidentally, a similar extension of temple boundaries is
observable in Egypt from the First Intermediate Period (c. 2200) and
onward; unlike the preceding Babylonian example of extending by building
numerous sanctuaries, this involves the extension of the boundaries of
only one temple:

::: cita
'We find the yearning for limitation side by side with the desire to
transcend and dissolve all boundaries.' By expanding a divine cult
complex, a king \[Pharaoh\] resolved this tension creatively,
simultaneously transcending old limits and establishing new ones. As
each king pushed the perimeter of walls and courtyards farther and
farther in to what had previously been secular space, the area of the
sacred was greatly
extended.[25](#appen11.html#NFIN154){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN154-1 .apnf}
:::

The process of temple expansion represented an attempt to extend the
space of existing order into the outer chaotic sphere (Hornung 1992:
116--118). In addition to widening a temple horizontally, the Egyptians
also built various levels skyward as well as into
subterra[]{#chap3.html#page_93}nean areas (Shafer 1997: 7). Such a
phenomenon of outward extension may be due to the Egyptian belief that
at the beginning of creation a small hillock arose, from which grew the
entire creation. Since, as we saw in chapter 1, the temple symbolized
the entire cosmos, and in particular the holiest place was conceived of
as resting on this primordial
mound,[26](#appen11.html#NFIN155){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN155-1 .apnf} it
would have made sense for kings to want to continue to extend the
boundaries of their temples ever outward, in imitation of the cosmos
that was expanded in the beginning by the Creator. The floor level of
the temple gradually got higher as one approached the sanctuary in order
to signify the primeval mound (Wilkinson 2000: 77).

The Egyptians employed other architectural features to portray the
temple as a kind of expanding new creation. The temple pylons pictured
the divine Pharaoh defeating his enemies, just as the Creator of the
world had overcome chaos and 'expanded the territory of cosmos'
(Finnestad 1997: 210). Imitation of the original cosmic expansion was
also reflected by making the holiest place the narrowest and smallest
part of the temple complex, with ever-widening sacred spaces as one
proceeded into the outer courts (1997: 210). Just as light flashed over
the earth at the beginning of creation, so the king-priest's
representation of the god in relation to the temple was to shine out
divine light increasingly throughout the earth (1997: 205--206, 213).
The divine light of Isis is said to illumine 'the Two lands with her
radiance, and fill\[s\] the earth with gold-dust', so that 'her radiance
\[is\] inundating the faces' (1997: 213).

These examples of expanding temples were imperfect echoes of the
original commission to the first human priest-king to subdue and rule
over the earth and fill it with God's glory by widening the primal
garden sanctuary. Genesis 1 -- 2 also stands as a polemic against all
imperfect attempts to fulfil this commission apart from faithful service
to the true God.

As we will see, after Adam's failure to fulfil God's mandate, God raises
up other Adam-like figures to whom his commission is passed on. We will

In fact, the same commission given to the patriarchs is restated
numerous times in subsequent Old Testament books both to Israel and the
true eschatological people of God. Like Adam, Noah and his children also
failed to perform this commission. God then gave the essence of the
commission of Genesis 1:28 to Abraham (Gen. 12:2; 17:2, 6, 8, 16;
22:18), Isaac (26:3--4, 24), Jacob (28:3--4, 14; 35:11--12; 48:3,
15--16), and to Israel (see Deut. 7:13 and Gen. 47:27; Exod. 1:7; Ps.
107:38; and Is. 51:2, the latter four of which state the beginning
fulfilment of the promise to Abraham in
Israel).[27](#appen11.html#NFIN156){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN156-1 .apnf} The
commission of Genesis 1:28 involved the following
elements:[]{#chap3.html#page_96}

 

1.  'God blessed them';

2.  'be fruitful and multiply';

3.  'fill the earth';

4.  'subdue' the 'earth';

5.  'rule over . . . all the earth' (so Gen. 1:26, and reiterated in
    1:28).

 

The commission is repeated, for example, to Abraham: (1) 'I will greatly
*bless you*, and (2) I will greatly *multiply your seed . . .* (3--5)
and *your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies* \[= 'subdue and
rule'\]. And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be *blessed
. . .'* (Gen.
22:17--18).[28](#appen11.html#NFIN157){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN157-1 .apnf}
God expresses the universal scope of the commission by underscoring that
the goal is to 'bless' 'all the nations of the earth'. It is natural,
therefore, that in the initial statement of the commission in Genesis
12:1--3 God commands Abraham, 'Go forth from your country . . . and so
be a blessing . . . and in you all the families of the earth shall be
blessed.'

Commentators apparently have not noticed something very interesting:
that the Adamic commission is repeated in direct connection with what
looks to be the building of small sanctuaries. Just as the Genesis 1:28
commission was initially to be carried out by Adam in a localized place,
enlarging the borders of the arboreal sanctuary, so it appears to be not
accidental that the restatement of the commission to Israel's patriarchs
results in the following:

 

1.  God appearing to them (except in Gen. 12:8; 13:3--4);

2.  they 'pitch a *tent*' (literally a 'tabernacle' in [LXX]{.small}),

3.  on a mountain;

4.  they build 'altars' and worship God (i.e., 'calling on the name of
    the L[ORD]{.small}', which probably included sacrificial offerings
    and prayer \[Pagolu 1998: 62\]) at the place of the restatement;

5.  the place where these activities occur is often located at 'Bethel'
    -- the 'House of God' (the only case of altar-building not
    containing these elements nor linked to the Genesis 1 commission is
    Gen. 33:20).

 

The combination of these five elements occurs elsewhere in the Old
Testament only in describing Israel's tabernacle or
temple\![29](#appen11.html#NFIN158){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN158-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap3.html#page_97}Therefore, though 'occasions for their sacrifices
were usually a theophany and moving to a new place' (Pagolu 1998: 85),
there seems to be more significance to the construction of these
sacrificial sites. The patriarchs appear also to have built these
worship areas as impermanent, miniature forms of sanctuaries that
symbolically represented the notion that their progeny were to spread
out to subdue the earth from a divine sanctuary in fulfilment of the
commission in Genesis
1:26--28.[30](#appen11.html#NFIN159){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN159-1 .apnf}
Though they built no buildings, these patriarchal sacred spaces can be
considered 'sanctuaries' along the lines comparable to the first
non-architectural sanctuary in the Garden of Eden. It will also be
important to recall later that a holy piece of geography or a sacred
area can be considered a true 'sanctuary' or 'temple' even when no
architectural building is constructed there.

These informal sanctuaries in Genesis pointed then to Israel's later
tabernacle and temple from which Israel was to branch out over all
[]{#chap3.html#page_98}the earth. Not many commentators hold this view.
After writing the first draft of this chapter, I found that A. Pagolu is
perhaps most clearly in agreement (1998: 70). He says that Isaac's
building of an altar at Beersheba was because that place already 'had a
tradition as a patriarchal sanctuary', as a result of Abraham's similar
earlier cultic activities, and, Pagolu contends, Jacob's subsequent
similar activities appear to confirm this (for Abraham's activities at
Beersheba, see Gen. 21:33; 22:19, and for Jacob's, see Gen. 46:1--14).
Pagolu adds that, in addition to Isaac building this site because of a
divine theophany and moving to a new area for the purpose of worship,
'it is possible to suggest that building an altar at Beer-sheba, the
southernmost border of the promised land, may have represented not only
a claim to the land but also a legitimation of the sanctuary for later
Israel' (1998: 70).[31](#appen11.html#NFIN160){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN160-1
.apnf}

G. Vos agrees that the theophanies at these altar sites prepared for the
more permanent theophany at the Jerusalem temple. He makes the
astounding and, as far as I can tell, unique claim that these episodes
not merely point to a future and greater temple but represent 'the
renewal of the paradise-condition and as such presages a full future
paradise. It points to the new world' (2001:
85--86).[32](#appen11.html#NFIN161){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN161-1 .apnf}

That these miniature sanctuaries adumbrated the later temple is also
suggested by the facts that 'before Moses the altar was the only
architectural feature marking a place as holy' and that later 'altars
were incorporated into the larger \[structural\] sanctuaries, the
tabernacle and the temple' (Longman 2001:
16).[33](#appen11.html#NFIN162){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN162-1 .apnf} The
small sanctuary in Bethel also became a larger sanctuary in the northern
kingdom of []{#chap3.html#page_99}Israel, though it subsequently became
idolatrous and was rejected as a true shrine of Yahweh
worship.[34](#appen11.html#NFIN163){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN163-1 .apnf}

The result of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob building altars at Shechem,
between Bethel and Ai, at Hebron, and near Moriah was that the terrain
of Israel's future land was dotted with shrines. This pilgrim-like
activity 'was like planting a flag and claiming the land' (Longman 2001:
20; sim. Pagolu 1998:
70)[35](#appen11.html#NFIN164){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN164-1 .apnf} for God
and Israel's future temple, where God would take up his permanent
residence in the capital of that
land.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN165){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN165-1 .apnf} Thus,
all these smaller sanctuaries pointed to the greater one to come in
Jerusalem.[37](#appen11.html#NFIN166){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN166-1 .apnf}
The patriarchs were like people climbing a tall mountain for the first
time and planting the national flag to indicate that the climber's
native land had first conquered the mountain.

### []{#chap3.html#page_100}Abraham at the mountains of Bethel and Moriah {.int_niv2}

Abraham, after receiving the Genesis 1 promissory commission, went 'to
the mountain on the east of Bethel \['House of God'\], and pitched his
tent . . . and there he built an altar to the L[ORD]{.small} and called
upon the name of the L[ORD]{.small}' (Gen. 12:8; so likewise Gen.
13:3--4). Sometimes mention is made only of the commission and of the
tent and altar (Gen. 13:18; 26:24--25). Only an altar is cited together
with the promise in Gen. 22:9--18, though there the site is also called
'the mountain of God', a name often attached by synecdoche to Israel's
temples.[38](#appen11.html#NFIN167){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN167-1 .apnf} That
'Mount Moriah' is the site of Abraham's aborted sacrifice of Isaac and
apparently also the site of the Solomonic temple (2 Chr. 3:1) suggests
'that God had long intended that the temple would eventually be placed
in the vicinity of Jerusalem' (Longman 2001:
45).[39](#appen11.html#NFIN168){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN168-1 .apnf} The
observation that Mount 'Moriah' is mentioned elsewhere in the Old
Testament only in 2 Chronicles 3:1 serves to enhance this point: 'Then
Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount
Moriah . . .' (Vawter 1977: 257).

### Jacob at the mountain of Bethel {.int_niv2}

Though a 'mountain' or 'hill' is not explicitly associated with Bethel
in the Jacob narratives, it is likely the same or, at least, near the
same location of Abraham's earlier similar experiences (notice that 'go
up to Bethel' occurs twice in Gen. 35:1, 3 in the introduction to the
narrative of Jacob's experience at Bethel). When the divine promises of
blessing are first made to Jacob (28:13--14), they are preceded by his
dream of a 'stairway' connecting heaven and earth and angels ascending
and descending on it and God appearing beside it (28:12). Jacob responds
by saying, 'This is none other than the house of God, and this is the
gate of heaven' (28:17). He then sets up a 'pillar, and poured oil on
its top' (equivalent to building an altar) and names the place 'Bethel'
(28:18--19). He concludes by declaring that 'this stone,
[]{#chap3.html#page_101}which I have set up as a pillar, will be God's
house' (28:22). This statement indicates that from the stone a
sanctuary, indeed, a temple would arise (Westermann 1995:
459).[40](#appen11.html#NFIN169){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN169-1 .apnf} He
returns to 'Bethel' later (Gen. 35:1--15), and the text notes three
times that Jacob builds an 'altar' there (35:1, 3, 7, and 14; Jacob also
establishes a sacred 'pillar' in v. 14).

This episode further links the altar construction of the patriarchs with
the notion of 'temple', since Israel's later temple was the place in all
of the world where heaven was linked to the earth, particularly the
'holy of holies' that represented God's invisible presence in heaven. It
is helpful in this respect to recall that the ark of the covenant in the
holy of holies was considered God's 'footstool', conjuring up the
picture of God sitting on his throne in heaven with his legs extending
to Israel's temple on earth (Is. 66:1; Acts 7:49; cf. also Ps. 99:5;
110:1; a 'footstool' was attached to Solomon's 'throne' in imitation of
God's throne \[2 Chr. 9:18\]). Indeed, Bethel became the site of 'the
ark of the covenant of the L[ORD]{.small}' during the time of the
judges, continuing apparently into the time of Samuel. This means, of
course, that the tabernacle was likewise there, since Phineas, Aaron's
grandson, served as high priest at Bethel, and Israel 'offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings' during his tenure (see Judg. 20:18--28; 1
Sam. 7:16; 10:3).

The holy site established by Jacob at 'Bethel' near 'Haran' in Genesis
28 and 35 is the clearest of the patriarchal sanctuary building
episodes, which is enhanced by its location at or near the second altar
built by Abraham (cf. Gen. 12:8, where the vicinity of 'Bethel \[House
of God\]' and 'Haran' \[Gen. 12:4\] are also mentioned). In this
respect, Genesis 28:11 introduces the narrative there by saying, Jacob
'came to *the* place \[*māqôm*\]', which may indicate that this site was
already considered holy because of Abraham's repeated earlier worship
there, which itself is twice referred to as 'the place \[*māqôm*\]' in
Genesis 13:3--4 (e.g., note 'the place of the altar' in
13:4).[41](#appen11.html#NFIN170){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN170-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap3.html#page_102}The associations with a temple in Genesis 28 are
enhanced by the Ancient Near Eastern associations of 'stairway-like'
structures that connected heaven to earth, allowing heavenly beings to
descend and dwell in a
temple.[42](#appen11.html#NFIN171){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN171-1 .apnf} The
tower of Babel in Genesis 11 may well have been an example of such
temple-like towers. In fact, the similarities between the tower of Babel
and Genesis 28 suggest that the latter is the true 'counterpoint' to the
former, which was a vain attempt to experience God's
presence.[43](#appen11.html#NFIN172){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN172-1 .apnf}

In keeping with the thesis that the patriarchal shrines both recalled
the original temple in Eden and anticipated the tabernacle and temple,
it is not likely coincidental that in the seven instances where the
patriarchs build their holy places, 'tree\[s\]' are present or close by
on four occasions (Gen. 12:6; 13:18; 22:13;
35:8),[44](#appen11.html#NFIN173){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN173-1 .apnf} though
all of them probably had a significant arboreal feature in their
midst.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN174){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN174-1 .apnf} In the
light of the links with Genesis 1 -- 2 noted above, the common feature
of a tree next to these worship sites, where humans experience God's
[]{#chap3.html#page_103}presence, might well evoke 'the tree of life' in
the Garden of Eden (Longman 2001:
21).[46](#appen11.html#NFIN175){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN175-1 .apnf}

### Jewish views of Jacob's temple-building activities in Genesis 28 {.int_niv2}

*Jubilees* 32:16--32 is the earliest Jewish commentary (2nd century
[BC]{.small}) identifying Jacob's building activities at Bethel as
temple construction: 'Jacob planned to build up that place and to build
a wall around the court, and to sanctify it, and make it eternally
holy.'[47](#appen11.html#NFIN176){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN176-1 .apnf}

With respect to the expectation of Israel's eschatological temple, the
Qumran Temple Scroll says, 'during the day of \[the new\] creation . . .
I \[God\] shall create my temple, establishing it for myself for ever,
*in accordance with the covenant which I made with Jacob at Bethel*'
(11Q19 29:8--9, my translation)! The 'covenant' refers to the threefold
promise God made to Jacob at Bethel, which, as we have seen, is the
reapplication of the Adamic commission: (1) that God would 'be with'
Jacob and his seed and 'keep' them and 'bring them back' (2) in order to
possess the promised land (Gen. 28:13, 15); (3) that his seed would
'spread out' to the four points of the compass, so that 'in you and your
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed' (28:14).

Thus, Qumran interprets that the future establishment of Israel's
eschatological temple will be the fulfilment of this threefold promise
and repeated Adamic
commission.[48](#appen11.html#NFIN177){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN177-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, this will take place at the time of the new 'creation', as
a recapitulation of the primal Edenic temple within which Adam and his
seed should have carried out their commission by spreading out over the
earth. Quite intriguingly, Philo, the first-century philosophical
theologian, understands the incipient sanctuary building episode at
Bethel to have fulfilment throughout the earth in *all saints* who
become cleansed by []{#chap3.html#page_104}God's word and, consequently,
'become a house of God, a holy temple, a most beauteous abiding-place'
(*Som*. 1.148--149).[49](#appen11.html#NFIN178){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN178-1
.apnf}

For all or some of these reasons, the Aramaic translation of the Old
Testament identifies the place of God's appearance to Jacob as a
'sanctuary' (*Tg. Pseudo-Jonathon Genesis* 28:11, 17; *Tg. Neofiti 1
Genesis* 28:22 \[literally, 'a house of holiness'\]). Later Judaism
identified the stone that Jacob set up as a sacred 'pillar' to be the
foundation stone of Solomon's temple (*Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer* 35) and
of the temple to be built at the time of Israel's restoration (cf.
*Midrash Tanhuma Genesis* 6:20; likewise *b. Pesachim*
88a).[50](#appen11.html#NFIN179){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN179-1 .apnf}

Thus, Judaism even more explicitly identifies Jacob's building
activities in Genesis 28 to be the beginning stages of temple
contruction.

### Noah on Mount Ararat {.int_niv2}

Though Noah precedes Abraham and his sons, it is more instructive for
our purposes to discuss his significance now, rather than earlier,
against the background of what took place with Abraham and his
descendants. That 'Noah built an altar to the L[ORD]{.small}' (Gen.
8:20), also in direct connection with God's reapplication of the Adamic
commission (Gen. 9:1, 7; cf. 8:17), indicates that this also may have
been an even earlier inchoate temple-building event. The following
observations enhance this suggestion. First, he 'offered burnt offerings
on the altar'. Second, these offerings were a 'soothing aroma' before
the Lord. The only other place where 'burnt offerings' (in singular) are
a 'soothing aroma' to God are the offerings in the
tabernacle.[51](#appen11.html#NFIN180){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN180-1 .apnf}
Third, Noah offers these sacrifices on a mountain (in the mountain range
of Ararat). Fourth, the distinction between 'clean and unclean' animals
is made for the first time here in the Bible (Gen. 7:2, 8), and only
'clean' animals could be offered as a sacrifice (Gen. 8:20). The only
other situation where a distinction between 'clean and unclean' animals
is made is in the context of requirements of those who want to gain
access to the outer court of the tabernacle (Lev. 11:47; 20:25; Deut.
12:15, 22).[52](#appen11.html#NFIN181){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN181-1 .apnf}

::: {#chap3.html#niv2-033 .niv2}
### []{#chap3.html#page_105}Israel at the mountain sanctuary of Sinai {.int_niv2}

Israel's encounter with God at Mount Sinai also appears to be another
experience of worship at a sacred location that approximates a temple
site. First, some of the same things seen with the sanctuary building of
the patriarchs appear here too. For example, Israel is to worship on a
mountain (Exod. 3:12), though Sinai is never called 'house of God'. In
addition, the Sinai episode exhibits other features typically associated
with Israel's later tabernacle or temple.

First, Sinai is called 'the mountain of God' (Exod. 3:1; 18:5; 24:13), a
name associated with Israel's temple on Mount
Zion.[53](#appen11.html#NFIN182){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN182-1 .apnf}

Second, just as with the tabernacle and temple, so Mount Sinai was
divided into three sections of increasing sanctity: the majority of the
Israelites were to remain at the foot of Sinai (Exod. 19:12, 23), the
priests and seventy elders (the latter functioning probably as priests)
were allowed to come some distance up the mountain (Exod. 19:22; 24:1),
but only Moses could ascend to the top and directly experience the
presence of God (Exod. 24:2).

Third, just as an altar was in the outermost section of the temple, so
an altar was built at the lowest and least sacred part of Sinai, where
Israel 'offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace
offerings to the L[ORD]{.small}. And Moses took half of the blood and .
. . sprinkled \[it\] on the altar' (Exod. 24:5--6). The temple
atmosphere of this text is apparent from observing that the phrase
'burnt offering\[s\]' occurs approximately thirty-eight times together
with 'peace offerings' in the Old Testament, and the vast majority refer
to sacrifices in the tabernacle or temple (though even some of the
remaining uses may be linked to a sanctuary setting: e.g., Judg. 20:26;
21:4; 1 Sam. 10:8; 13:9). Likewise, the majority of the numerous uses of
each of the two phrases by themselves refer to the same temple context.

Fourth, not only does the top part of Sinai approximate the holy of
holies because only Israel's 'high priest', Moses, could enter there,
but it was the place where God's theophanic 'cloud' and presence 'dwelt'
(Exod. 24:15--17; for Moses as a 'high priest' see Philo, *Vit. Mos.*
2.75). Significantly, the only other times in all of the Old
[]{#chap3.html#page_106}Testament that God's presence is spoken of as a
'cloud dwelling' is with respect to God's presence above the tabernacle
(Exod. 40:35; Num. 9:17--18, 22; 10:12). Even the word 'dwell' (*šākan*)
could be rendered 'to tabernacle' (*miškān*) and the word 'tabernacle'
is the noun form of this verb (which is used with the verb in three of
the four preceding texts). So also, 1 Kings 8:12--13 says that God
'would dwell in the thick cloud' in the temple completed by Solomon.
Furthermore, the 'ten commandments' and the 'ark' are created at the top
of Sinai (Deut. 10:1--5), just as later they find their place in the
inner sanctum of the temple, once again in God's presence.

Fifth, earlier in Exodus God's presence at Sinai was depicted as a
'cassia tree \[*sěneh*, or 'bush'\] burning with fire, yet the cassia
tree was not consumed' (Exod. 3:2). In the light of the parallels
already adduced, this 'unconsumed burning tree' may be the proleptic
equivalent to the lampstand-like tree in the holy place on Mount Zion,
whose lamps burned
continually.[54](#appen11.html#NFIN183){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN183-1 .apnf}
Correspondingly, the ground around the burning tree is called 'the
place' of 'holy ground' (Exod. 3:5). The correspondence of this small
area at Sinai to the later 'holy place' is seen from the only other uses
of 'holy place' in Hebrew, four of which refer to the section of the
sanctuary directly outside the 'holy of holies' (Lev. 7:6; 10:17; 14:13;
24:9) and the remaining two refer to the temple in general (Ezra 9:8;
Ps. 24:3).

As in the case of the temporary patriarchal shrines, so the Siniatic
holy place is linked to development of the themes found in Genesis 1:28.
God sends Moses to deliver Israel out of Egypt's womb because the
embryonic seed of Jacob has come to full term, in fulfilment not only of
the Abrahamic promises but also of the promissory Adamic commission:
'But the sons of Israel were *fruitful* and *swarmed* greatly, and
*multiplied*, and became exceedingly numerous, so that *the land was
filled* with them.'[55](#appen11.html#NFIN184){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN184-1
.apnf}

In this respect, subduing the land of Canaan is also mentioned (Exod.
3:8, 17). Not surprisingly, there is also a link with the promise to
'Abraham, Isaac and Jacob' (Exod. 3:6,
15--16).[56](#appen11.html#NFIN185){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN185-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap3.html#page_107}In the light of the association of Sinai as a
temple, it may not be accidental that Revelation 11:19 later alludes to
the theophanic phenomena at Sinai in describing the opening of the
heavenly holy of holies at the end of history, when 'the ark of his
covenant' will be revealed ('there came about lightnings and sounds and
thunders').[57](#appen11.html#NFIN186){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN186-1 .apnf}

In this light, Sinai was an appropriate place for God to show to Moses
'the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture' in
order that they would construct it exactly as it was 'shown' to Moses
(Exod. 25:9; cf. 25:40). Hence, once Israel leaves the stationary
sanctuary of Sinai, the commission is passed on to them to build the
mobile tabernacle in order that God's glorious presence would continue
to 'dwell among them' during their wilderness wanderings (Exod. 25:8).
Indeed, it has been observed by others that the building of the
tabernacle itself appears to have been modelled on the tripartite
pattern of Sinai.[58](#appen11.html#NFIN187){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN187-1
.apnf} The building of the tabernacle would be a step towards the
construction of the immovable temple in Jerusalem.

::: {#chap3.html#niv2-034 .niv2}
### David and Solomon at Mount Moriah {.int_niv2}

What appears implicit with the patriarchs and with Moses at Sinai,
becomes explicit with Israel's tabernacle and temple. The first book of
Chronicles narrates David's preparations for building the temple that
Solomon will accomplish. David's preparatory actions include all the
same elements found with the small-scale temple building activities of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, which confirms that their building activities
were, indeed, miniature versions of, or pointers to, a later sanctuary.

 

1.  David begins the preparations on a mountain (Mount Moriah);

2.  David experiences a theophany (he sees 'the angel of the
    L[ORD]{.small} standing between earth and heaven'; so 1 Chr. 21:16;
    2 Chr. 3:1).

3.  At this site 'David built an altar to the L[ORD]{.small} . . .

4.  'and offered burnt offerings . . . And he called to the
    L[ORD]{.small}' (1 Chr. 21:26).

5.  Furthermore, David calls the place 'the house of the L[ORD]{.small}
    God' (1 Chr. 22:1) because this is the site of Israel's future
    temple to be prepared by David and built by Solomon (1 Chr. 22; 2
    Chr. 3:1).

 

[]{#chap3.html#page_108}Now we can see more clearly that the
altar-building activities of the patriarchs were constructions of
small-scale sanctuaries that find their climax with the larger-scale
construction of Israel's temple. The episode in 1 Chronicles 21
particularly mirrors the one with Jacob, where also God and angels
appear to him and a link between 'earth' and 'heaven' is
underscored.[59](#appen11.html#NFIN188){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN188-1 .apnf}
The reason why David performed priestly activities at this site was
twofold: first, because from that very site the temple of Israel was to
be built; second, because the 1 Chronicles 21 passage goes on to say
that 'the tabernacle . . . which Moses had made . . . and the altar of
burnt offering were in . . . Gibeon at that time' (21:29). This latter
point implies not only that David was not able to travel there to offer
sacrifices at the properly designated cultic place, but that a
transition from the movable tabernacle to the permanent temple has
begun. Mount Moriah was now becoming the designated place for sacrifice
because the temple would soon be built
there.[60](#appen11.html#NFIN189){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN189-1 .apnf}

As with the patriarchs, there are also links in the Davidic narrative
with Genesis 1:28, though not as explicitly. In direct connection with
David's preparations for the building of the temple in 1 Chronicles
29:10--12, he praises God: '*Blessed* art Thou, O L[ORD]{.small} . . .
Thine . . . is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory
and the majesty, indeed everything that is in *the heavens and the
earth*; Thine is the *dominion . . .* Thou dost exalt Thyself as head
over all . . . Thou dost *rule over all . . .* and it lies in Thy hand
to make great, and to strengthen everyone.'

David uses language synonymous to that of Genesis 1:28 to praise God
himself because he is the one who 'makes great and strengthens' his
human vice-regents to rule under his hand. Then Solomon is designated in
the following verses as the example *par excellance* of such a
vice-regent: 'Then Solomon sat on the throne of the L[ORD]{.small} as
king . . . And the L[ORD]{.small} highly exalted Solomon . . . and
bestowed on him []{#chap3.html#page_109}royal majesty which had not been
on any king before him in Israel' (29:23--25). It is probably not
accidental that a few verses earlier David refers explicitly to the
nation's identification with the patriarchs: he petitions 'the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers' to preserve the peoples' godly
desires and 'give to my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep \['guard'\]
Thy statutes . . . and to build the temple, for which I have made
provision' (29:18--19), perhaps echoing the first temple context of
Genesis 2:15--16: to 'guard' the garden sanctuary by following what God
'commanded'. Solomon completed the foundation-laying activities of his
father: 'Then Solomon began to build the house of the L[ORD]{.small} in
Jerusalem on Mount Moriah . . .' (2 Chr. 3:1).

Second Samuel 7 (= 1 Chr. 17) closely links the need to build a temple
(7:2--13) with the following aspects of Genesis 1:28: (1) ruling and
subduing (7:9--16), and (2) a blessing on God's kingly vice-regent
(7:29). It may also not be unexpected, therefore, that 2 Samuel 7:9, 'I
will make you a great name', would allude to Genesis 12:2, 'I will . . .
make your name great.' Accordingly, it is natural that the overall
purpose is linked to God giving 'rest' to Israel's king from his enemies
(7:1, 11). This prophecy is fulfilled only partially by Solomon,
however, since 2 Samuel 7:10--16 says that the coming kingdom and temple
will last for ever,[61](#appen11.html#NFIN190){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN190-1
.apnf} which was not true with Solomon's and his descendants' (Exod.
15:17--18 also affirms the same thing of the coming kingdom and,
implicitly, of the temple, to which allusion is made in 2 Sam. 7:10,
12--13 cf. also 2 Chron. 8:16 \[[LXX]{.small}\]).
:::

::: {#chap3.html#niv2-035 .niv2}
### Post-exilic Israel {.int_niv2}

That Noah, the patriarchs, Moses and David were building nascent temple
structures is further apparent from noticing that the same embryonic
temple-building pattern occurs when the remnant of Israel returns from
Babylon to reconstruct the temple. They (1) 'built the altar of the God
of Israel' on the 'foundation' of the former temple at Mount Zion (Ezra
3:2--3); and (2) began 'to offer burnt offerings' (Ezra 3:2), and
worshipped through the playing of music and by 'praising and giving
thanks' (Ezra 3:10--11). (3) They also refer to the structure as 'a
house to our God' (Ezra 4:3). In this situation,
[]{#chap3.html#page_110}however, there appear to be no clear references
to Genesis 1:28 nor the Abrahamic promises. And even before the
post-exilic temple was constructed, Ezekiel 11:16 says that though God
had exiled Judah and Benjamin to Babylon, 'yet I \[Yahweh\] was a
*sanctuary* for them a little while . . .' This suggests that the
presence of the Lord, which gave essential meaning to the temple,
continued with the faithful remnant in exile to form a veritable
invisible temple for them until they could return and begin building the
second temple (Clowney 1972: 163).

Like Solomon's temple, Israel's second temple did not fulfil the
prophecy of Exodus 15:17--18 and 2 Samuel
7:10--16.[62](#appen11.html#NFIN191){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN191-1 .apnf}
Therefore, Exodus 15, 2 Samuel 7 and subsequent prophets foresaw an
eschatological temple, the ideal descriptions of which both the first
and second temples fell short (followed by 2 Maccabees 1:27--29; cf. 2
Maccabees 2:17--18).[63](#appen11.html#NFIN192){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN192-1
.apnf} Not only were these two temples not eternal, but we will see
later that they could not fulfil the end-time expectations for other
reasons.
:::

::: {#chap3.html#niv2-036 .niv2}
### End-time Israel {.int_niv2}

Israel's prophesied eschatological temple has the same associations as
most of the preceding temple constructions. In Leviticus 26:6--12,
allusion is made to Genesis 1:28 in direct connection to the erection of
the tabernacle in Israel's midst: if Israel is faithful, they will
defeat their enemies in the land, and 'I will turn toward you and *make
you fruitful and multiply you*, and I will confirm My covenant with you
. . . Moreover, I will make My *tabernacle* among you . . . I will also
walk among you and be your God, and you will be My
people.'[64](#appen11.html#NFIN193){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN193-1 .apnf}

Ezekiel 36 -- 37 makes the same link: after promising that God would
restore Israel and 'multiply men', and make them 'increase and be
fruitful' (36:10--11), he also promises a 'multiplication' of
fruitfulness (36:29--30), so that Israel's formerly desolated land will
'become like the garden of Eden' in which God 'will increase their men
like a flock' (cf. 36:35--38). Then, in direct development of these
preceding ideas and of Leviticus 26:6--12
(!),[65](#appen11.html#NFIN194){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN194-1 .apnf} Ezekiel
37:26--28 again refers to []{#chap3.html#page_111}that aspect of the
promise of 'multiplying them' and ties it to Israel's
temple:[66](#appen11.html#NFIN195){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN195-1 .apnf} 'It
will be an everlasting covenant . . . And I will . . . multiply them,
and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever. My dwelling place \[or
'tabernacle'\] also will be over them; and I will be their God, and they
will be My people. And the nations will know that I am the
L[ORD]{.small} who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their
midst forever.'[67](#appen11.html#NFIN196){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN196-1
.apnf}

Strikingly, there is also an association of an eschatological Eden with
an end-time temple (Ezek. 36:35), which Ezekiel later identifies with
the latter-day temple in chapters 40 -- 48, and which is also depicted
with imagery from Eden (e.g., see 43:7--12). While Leviticus 26 and
Ezekiel 37 could be read as prophesying God's tabernacling presence in a
temple structure, it is just as possible, if not preferable, to
understand them as foretelling a time when the temple will be, not a
physical handmade house, but God's manifest presence alone that will
fill Israel (and the earth) as never before. Leviticus 26:11--12 could
imply this: 'moreover, I will make My *tabernacle among you . . .* I
will also *walk among you* and be your God, and you will be my people.'
God's tabernacling presence will abide with all his redeemed people. It
would be hard for God freely to 'walk among' his people if his
tabernacling presence were confined to a physical sanctuary, unless one
were to think of it more figuratively as when God's tabernacle sojourned
with Israel during her wilderness
wanderings.[68](#appen11.html#NFIN197){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN197-1 .apnf}
But, especially in light of its development in Ezekiel 37, the Leviticus
promise of God's 'walking among' the people likely expresses a more
ultimate personal and intense relationship than his present dwelling
with them within an encased structure.

What indicates that this tabernacle is not to be like the former,
smaller physical structures is the phrase in Ezekiel 37:27: 'My dwelling
place also will be *over* \[preposition *'al*\] them.' Apparently, at
the least, the new tabernacle will extend over all of God's people who
have been 'multiplied' and 'shall live on the land', that is, living
throughout the land of promise (on which see
[]{#chap3.html#page_112}37:24--28)\![69](#appen11.html#NFIN198){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN198-1
.apnf} That the temple's worldwide goal is being achieved is alluded to
in verse 28: 'the nations will know that I am the L[ORD]{.small}' (both
in judgment and in 'blessing' those who believe).

Along similar lines, Jeremiah 3:16--18 combines the commission found in
Genesis 1:28[70](#appen11.html#NFIN199){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN199-1 .apnf}
with the notion of a latter-day temple and makes explicit that God's
tabernacling presence would not be restricted to an inner cultic room:

::: cita
^16^'And it shall be in those days when you *are multiplied and
increased* in the land', declares the L[ORD]{.small}, 'they shall say no
more, "The ark of the covenant of the L[ORD]{.small}." And it shall not
come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they miss it, nor
shall it be made again. ^17^At that time they shall call Jerusalem "The
Throne of the L[ORD]{.small}", and all the nations will be gathered to
it, for the name of the L[ORD]{.small} in Jerusalem; nor shall they walk
anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart. ^18^In those days
the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will
come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your
fathers as an inheritance.'
:::

Israel will finally fulfil the Genesis mandate 'to multiply and
increase' at the time of her latter-day restoration (Jer. 3:16). The
fact that Gentiles will stream in suggests that they also will play a
role in fulfilling that commission. Though this fulfilment is coupled
with a promise of a future temple, it is one that will not be like any
earlier []{#chap3.html#page_113}structures. Not even the centrepiece of
the old temple, the ark of the covenant, will exist in the renewed
Jerusalem. Only God's presence will exist as the new sanctuary.

The ark represented the special manifestation of God's ruling presence
that extended from heaven to earth. The ark is repeatedly called God's
'footstool' (1 Chr. 28:2; Pss. 99:5; 132:7). The Israelites pictured God
to be sitting on a throne in heaven with his feet extending to the ark
as his footstool in the earthly temple (Is. 66:1, 'Heaven is My throne,
and the earth is My footstool'; 2 Kgs. 19:15; Lam. 2:1). Recall that a
'footstool' was attached to Solomon's 'throne' (2 Chr. 9:18), which was
modelled after the notion that the ark was the footstool of God's
heavenly throne.

Thus, the ark and God's heavenly throne were inextricably
linked.[71](#appen11.html#NFIN200){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN200-1 .apnf}
Jeremiah 3 says not that a future cultic structure in Jerusalem will be
the place of God's presence but the entire future Jerusalem itself will
be called 'the throne of the L[ORD]{.small}'. The reason for this is
that the essence of the old temple, God's ruling presence, will be
expressed in an unfettered way at the end time.

As we will see, the reason that the ark in the temple will have waned in
significance when the Genesis 1:28 commission is finally fulfilled is
that there will be a greater temple with a greater glory than a mere
physical one, not only expanding to encompass all of Jerusalem (thus the
point of Jer. 3:17) but the entire earth, as other biblical texts will
testify.[72](#appen11.html#NFIN201){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN201-1 .apnf}

### The differences between the commission to Adam and that passed on to his descendants {.int_niv2}

Despite the many similarities between the original commission in Genesis
1 and that given to Abraham and his Israelite seed, some differences
exist. Before Adam's disobedience, he would have fulfilled the 'subduing
and ruling' part of the commission by demonstrating sovereignty through
cultivating the earth and having mastery over all the creatures of the
earth, including the satanic 'serpent' who existed outside the Garden
and who would subsequently enter into it. After Adam's sin, the
commission would be expanded to include renewed humanity's reign over
unregenerate human forces arrayed against it. Hence, the language of
'possessing []{#chap3.html#page_114}the gate of their enemies' is
included, which elsewhere is stated as 'subduing the land' (note here
Num. 32:22, 'and the land is *subdued* before the L[ORD]{.small}', where
the same word \[*kābaš*\] is used for 'subdue' as in Gen. 1:28) (N. T.
Wright 1992a: 23). The mention of 'all the nations of the earth' being
'blessed' by Abraham's 'seed' alludes to a renewed human community
bearing God's image and 'filling the earth' with regenerated progeny who
also reflect God's image and shine out its luminosity to others in the
'city of man' who do not rebel and also come to reflect God. Thus, these
new converts are 'blessed' with the favour of God's presence and become
a part of God's ever-increasing kingdom.

Another difference in the repetition of the Genesis 1 commission is that
it is now stated formally as a
*promise*,[73](#appen11.html#NFIN202){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN202-1 .apnf}
with the commission being implied. That the aspect of the 'commission'
is still retained is apparent from the imperatives introducing the
commission in Genesis 12:1--3: 'Go forth from your country . . . be a
blessing.' The implication is that humanity cannot carry out this
commission on its own, but God will enable them in some way to perform
it (see also Gen. 17:1--7; 18:18--19).

God's assurance that 'I am with you' was not addressed to Adam or Noah,
and is not formulated until the promise is repeated to Jacob. This
assurance is the basis for God's promise and commission to spread out in
order that his tabernacling presence would spread (see with respect to
Isaac \[Gen. 26:24\], Jacob \[Gen. 28:15\] and Moses \[Exod. 3:12\]).
The divine assurance 'I am with you' is central to the task of extending
the 'temple' of God's presence, as is apparent from noticing that this
forms part of God's promise and commission to Isaac, to Jacob and to
Moses (again, see respectively Gen. 26:24; 28:15; Exod. 3:12). It was
this very presence that provided enablement of the task and assured the
fulfilment of the
promise.[74](#appen11.html#NFIN203){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN203-1 .apnf} In
response to God's presence, Israel was 'to walk in His ways and to keep
His commandments' in order to fulfil the original Adamic commission: to
'live and multiply, and that the L[ORD]{.small} your God may bless you
in the land where you are entering to possess it' (Deut. 30:16).
Ultimately, only if God 'circumcised their heart' would they be able to
love and obey him, continue in his presence, and inherit the promise and
truly 'live' (Deut. 30:5--6, 16).

[]{#chap3.html#page_115}Essentially the same formula is repeated to
Solomon. David says to his son, 'the L[ORD]{.small} be with you that you
may be successful, and build the house of the L[ORD]{.small} your God
just as He has spoken . . . Only the L[ORD]{.small} give you . . .
understanding . . . so that you may keep the law of the L[ORD]{.small}
your God' (1 Chr. 22:11--12). The promise formula occurs in direct
connection to Solomon building the temple.

God pronounces the same formula when he commissions Jeremiah and enables
him to be a 'prophet to the nations' (1:5) and 'to destroy and to
overthrow, to build and to plant' (1:10; for the formula, see 1:8, 19).
God speaks the same formula to Israel when he tells them that his
purpose in regathering them from exile was to renew their commission to
be a 'witness' to the nations about his purpose in creating 'new things'
(Is. 43:5--21).

It may not be coincidental that, after the return from Babylonian exile,
this formula is also applied twice to the remnant in the land to
encourage them to rebuild the temple (Hag. 1:13; 2:4). Haggai 2:5
elaborates the meaning of the formula: 'As for the promise which I made
you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit is abiding in your midst . .
.' (likewise, it is 'My Spirit' that Zech. 4:6--9 says will empower King
Zerubbabel to build the second temple). The promise referred to is
likely that made in Exodus 33:14--17:

::: cita
^14^And He said, 'My presence shall go \[with you\], and I will give you
rest.' ^15^Then he \[Moses\] said to Him, ^16^' . . . how then can it be
known that I have found favor in Thy sight, I and Thy people? Is it not
by Thy going with us, so that we . . . may be distinguished from all the
\[other\] people who are upon the face of the earth?'

^17^And the L[ORD]{.small} said to Moses, 'I will also do this thing of
which you have spoken . . .' (cf. also Exod. 34:9).
:::

Perhaps Haggai 2 also alludes to Exodus 19:5--6: 'you shall be My own
possession among all the peoples . . . you shall be to Me a kingdom of
priests . . .' The entire nation was to live in the midst of God's
presence, and were all to become like priests standing in the presence
of God in his temple and reflecting his glorious light, being
intermediaries for the nations living in darkness and apart from God.

Thus, Haggai 2 refers to a time when God will enable his people to build
his temple through the power of his Spirit, which is to be a fulfilment
of the promise in Exodus 33 and the promissory commission in Exodus 19.
In other words, Haggai 2 interprets the promise in the
[]{#chap3.html#page_116}two Exodus passages to be that of building God's
end-time temple among his people. Haggai's description of the temple to
be built goes well beyond the second temple that was eventually
constructed. Though the building project might look insignificant in
comparison to the earlier Solomonic temple, nevertheless, God promises
to make 'the latter glory of this house . . . greater than the former'
(Hag. 2:3--9). Since the building of the second temple did not excel the
glory of the Solomonic temple nor fulfil the expectation of Ezekiel's
prophesied, eschatological temple (see Ezek. 40 -- 48),
'intertestamental' Judaism naturally awaited a future eschatological
time when this would finally happen. Not only was the second temple
initially smaller than Solomon's but it did not last for ever, having
been destroyed in [AD]{.small} 70, thus causing a crisis in the way Jews
thought about the temple from then on.

Certainly Adam's obedience within the garden sanctuary was key to
carrying out his mandate by means of God's presence with him (recall
'God walking back and forth in the garden' \[Gen. 3:8\]). But there is
no scriptural record that God promised to him that his presence would
always be with him in carrying out his mandate. Indeed, God withdrew his
presence from Adam. As a result of sin, Adam was cast out of the
sanctuary of God's glorious presence and was not able to fulfil the
divine commission.

Just as in the case of Adam, Israel's obedience within their 'garden of
Eden' to the laws regulating the temple was a part of carrying out their
renewed commission as a corporate Adam. Israel's land is explicitly
compared to the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 13:10; Is. 51:3; Ezek. 36:35;
47:12; Joel 2:3) and is portrayed as very fruitful in order to heighten
the correspondence to Eden (cf. Deut. 8:7--10; 11:8--17; Ezek. 47:1--12)
(see Dumbrell 2002: 58--59). The Promised Land itself is called God's
'holy land' (Ps. 78:54; Zech. 2:12) because it was to be a Garden of
Eden on a grander scale (Dumbrell 2002: 58--61). The commission to have
dominion (Gen. 1:26--28), first expressed through Adam's role in Eden,
is expressed in Israel's temple that also represented God's cosmic rule
(Clements 1965:
67--73).[75](#appen11.html#NFIN204){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN204-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap3.html#page_117}This commission is expressed well in Exodus
19:6, a text alluded to earlier, which says of the whole nation, 'you
shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation'. They were to be
mediators in spreading the light of God's tabernacling presence to the
rest of the dark world. Such a connection of Genesis 1:28 to Eden and
the temple may have sparked off the following thought in the *Hymn
Scroll* of Qumran: 'my dominion shall be over the sons \[of the ear\]th
. . . I will shine with a seven-fold li\[ght\] in the E\[den
which\][76](#appen11.html#NFIN205){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN205-1 .apnf} Thou
hast \[m\]ade for Thy glory' (1QH 7.23--24, where the temple lampstand
with seven lamps is probably behind the image of the 'seven-fold
light').

Nevertheless, like Adam, Israel sinned and was cast away from God's
presence and out of the land. At the same time God withdrew his presence
from their temple (Ezek. 9:3; 10:4, 18--19; 11:22--23). The same thing
happened to restored Israel in [AD]{.small} 70, when the Romans
destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, though God's presence had long since
left that temple.[77](#appen11.html#NFIN206){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN206-1
.apnf} Thus, the promise of divine accompaniment to enable fulfilment of
the Genesis 1 mandate was not ultimately fulfilled in Abraham or any of
the physical descendants nor in Israel's temple but remained yet to be
realized.

### The commission as a mandate to witness {.int_niv2}

We briefly observed above that Abraham's descendants were to be a
renewed humanity. They were to bear God's image and 'fill the earth'
with children who also bore that image, being beacons of light to others
living in spiritual darkness. They were to be God's instruments through
whom God caused the light of his presence to shine in dark hearts of
people in order that they too might become part of the increasing
expansion of the temple's sacred space and of the kingdom. This is none
other than performing the role of 'witness' to God throughout the earth.

In fact, we can speak of Genesis 1:28 as the first 'Great Commission'
that was repeatedly applied to humanity. The commission was to bless the
earth, and part of the essence of this blessing was God's salvific
presence. Before the fall, Adam and Eve were to produce progeny who
would fill the earth with God's glory being
[]{#chap3.html#page_118}reflected from each of them in the image of God.
After the fall, a remnant, created by God in his restored image, were to
go out and spread God's glorious presence among the rest of darkened
humanity. This 'witness' was to continue until the entire world would be
filled with divine glory.

Israel's 'witness' as a corporate Adam was especially significant. In
this connection, the question of why the tabernacle was sometimes called
the 'tabernacle of testimony' (5 times: e.g., Exod. 38:21) or 'tent of
testimony' (5 times: e.g., Num. 9:15) needs
addressing.[78](#appen11.html#NFIN207){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN207-1 .apnf}
The most obvious answer is that the tabernacle housed the 'ark of the
testimony' (so 14 times: e.g., Exod. 25:22; 26:33--34). But why is the
ark referred to in this way? The reason is that the ten commandments are
sometimes called the
'testimony'.[79](#appen11.html#NFIN208){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN208-1 .apnf}
God gave the commandments to Moses at Sinai, and Moses placed them in
the ark. The ten commandments were called the 'testimony' because they
were written 'by the finger of God' (Exod. 31:18) and were the visible
evidence of God's truth and will. The Law was God's 'testimony because
it is his own affirmation relative to his very person and purpose'
(Schultz 1980: 650). Moreover, this 'testimony' functioned for the
nation as a 'witness' of God's saving acts (van Leeuwen 1997: 844). This
latter point is apparent by recalling that the ark was not only the
depository of the ten commandments (Exod. 25:16--22) but also directly
in front of the ark were placed items that recalled God's great acts on
behalf of Israel: the jar of manna (Exod. 16:31--36), a portion of
Moses' incense (Exod. 30:36) and Aaron's rod that budded (Num. 17).

Thus, the ten commandments reminded Israel not only of God's moral will
for them but of their deliverance from Egypt (Exod. 20:2), God's
creation of the world (Exod. 20:11), and of his presence with and
providential care of them in the wilderness. All of these items were an
evidential, legal 'testimony' of God's saving and preserving presence as
it had been manifested in various ways to
Israel.[80](#appen11.html#NFIN209){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN209-1 .apnf} The
emphasis on the divine presence with respect to the ark or tabernacle of
'testimony' is underscored by repeated statements that each of the four
holy items located at the place of the ark were in God's very
[]{#chap3.html#page_119}presence.[81](#appen11.html#NFIN210){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN210-1
.apnf} In this respect, the Hebrew of Exodus 30:36 refers to 'the
testimony in the tent of meeting, where I shall meet with you' (so also
Num. 17:4). The Hebrew expression 'tent of meeting' referred to 'the
appointed place where Yahweh will meet with
Moses'.[82](#appen11.html#NFIN211){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN211-1 .apnf} The
Greek Old Testament's substitution of 'testimony' for 'meeting'
indicates that the point of God's presence with Moses was that he would
'testify' to Moses about himself, his Law, and his redemptive deeds for
Israel, all of which have demonstrated his presence with the entire
nation.[83](#appen11.html#NFIN212){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN212-1 .apnf}

The legal nature of the 'testimony' is evident from observing that the
cognate noun *̒ēd* is almost always translated as 'witness' and occurs
typically in legal contexts (e.g., to find someone guilty of a crime in
Israel requires 'two witnesses'). A 'witness' (*martys*) 'testifies'
(*martyreō*) in court to confirm the truth of something (e.g., see the
[LXX]{.small} of Num. 35:30). Accordingly, when Israel would disobey
God's Law, 'the book of the law . . . beside the ark of the covenant'
would be 'a witness against' Israel (Deut. 31:26). Therefore, the two
tablets of the Law served as a daily reminder of the covenant between
Yahweh and Israel.

Presumably, part of the point of the repeated reference to the
'tabernacle of testimony' and the 'ark of testimony' is that Israel
herself was to accept God's 'testimony' and then bear witness to God's
saving presence with her in the past and present by declaring God's own
'testimony' to his Law and to the various redemptive acts performed on
their behalf.[84](#appen11.html#NFIN213){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN213-1 .apnf}
In addition, the nation was to be a 'testimony' by obeying the Law. All
of this would bear witness to the truth of God's
presence.[85](#appen11.html#NFIN214){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN214-1 .apnf}

Consequently, the way God's presence was to spread out from the holy of
holies was for his people to pay heed to his testimony deposited there
by giving testimony in word and obedient deed before the
[]{#chap3.html#page_120}nations to God's truth. If Israel did this, it
would show that God's presence was with them as the enabler of their
faithfulness. Deuteronomy 4:5--7 expresses this purpose well, especially
in linking Israel's understanding and obeying of God's law with his
presence, and thus implicitly with the role of witness:

::: cita
^5^'See, I \[Moses\] have taught you statutes and judgments just as the
L[ORD]{.small} my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land
where you are entering to possess it. ^6^'So keep and do them, for that
is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who
will hear all these statutes and say, "Surely this great nation is a
wise and understanding people." ^7^'For what great nation is there that
*has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on
Him*?'
:::

This is likewise closely linked with Exodus 33:14--17, where God tells
Moses that 'My presence shall go \[with you\]' and Moses responds by
saying that 'Thy going with us' will result in Israel being
'distinguished from all the people who are upon the face of the earth'.
After the restoration from Babylon, God commands Israel to be
'witnesses'[86](#appen11.html#NFIN215){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN215-1 .apnf}
to their 'knowledge' and 'belief' that God was the only true God, and
that he will express his divine omnipotence by again delivering Israel
out of a second bondage and performing a second exodus to the promised
land (Is. 43:10--12; 44:6--8).

That Israel was to be a 'witness' to the nations is implied at various
points (cf. Is. 43:9) but made explicit in Isaiah 55:4, where God says
that he had made David 'a witness to the peoples', a commission that
Israel should share. Israel's kings were to be leaders in bearing this
'testimony'.[87](#appen11.html#NFIN216){#chap3.html#ap_NFIN216-1 .apnf}
This commission was Israel's task to 'call' the nations to God (Is.
55:5). In order to accomplish this mission Israel was first to 'seek the
L[ORD]{.small} while He may be found' and 'call upon Him while He may be
near' (Is. 55:6).

However, just as Adam 'hid . . . from the presence of the
L[ORD]{.small}' (Gen. 3:8), thus ensuring failure to accomplish his
mission, Israel, as representative of God's true humanity, also
separated themselves from the divine presence and failed to carry out
the commission. Thus, it is not an overstatement to say that Israel was
conceived of []{#chap3.html#page_121}as a 'corporate Adam'. The nation's
task was to do what Adam had first been commissioned to do. Israel
failed even as had Adam. And like Adam, Israel was also cast out of
their 'garden land' into exile. Though a remnant of Israel returned from
exile, her failure to carry out the Adamic task continued until the
beginning of the first century [AD]{.small}.

# The expanding end-time purpose of temples in the Old Testament {.chap_tit}

::: dev
There are indications elsewhere in the Old Testament, which are
developed later by Jewish commentators, that Eden and the temple
signified a divine mandate to enlarge the boundaries of the temple until
they formed the borders around the whole earth. Sometimes the thought
may be that the entire land of Israel, conceived as a large Garden of
Eden, was to be expanded. The subject matter in the present chapter is
one of the strongest pieces of evidence substantiating our contention in
the preceding chapter that the boundaries of the Eden garden-sanctuary
and of Israel's temples were meant to be extended to encircle the entire
world. While the eschatological goal of the Old Testament was discussed
in the preceding chapter, here we will focus more explicitly on that
goal.

We will first survey a number of Old Testament passages where an
expanding end-time garden or temple is found, some of which should be
seen as the precursors, together with Genesis 1 -- 2, inspiring later
portrayals by Jewish writers, which we will survey toward the end of
this chapter.

### Numbers 24:5--9 {.int_niv2}

This passage has an abbreviated portrayal of an expanding garden, which
has affinities with our intial explanation of the original purpose of
Eden[1](#appen11.html#NFIN217){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN217-1 .apnf} sketched
out at the beginning of the preceding chapter:

^8^'God brings him out of Egypt . . .

He shall devour the nations who are his adversaries . . .

^9^'Blessed is everyone who blesses you,

And cursed is everyone who curses you.'
:::

On analogy with later Old Testament texts referring to the temple in the
plural, the same may well be the case in verse
5.[4](#appen11.html#NFIN220){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN220-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, when these two Hebrew words for 'tent' and 'dwelling' occur
together everywhere else in the Pentateuch (so 25 times up to Num. 24),
only once (Num. 16:27, in the plural) do they refer generally to
Israel's dwellings around the tabernacle, and twenty-four times they
refer to the
'tabernacle'.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN221){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN221-1 .apnf}
If 'tents' and 'dwellings' in Numbers 24:5 is a plural reference to the
tabernacle, this is another passage explaining Israel's
[]{#chap4.html#page_125}task by linking a portrayal of her as a
tabernacle[6](#appen11.html#NFIN222){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN222-1 .apnf}
with the picture of vegetation and waters spreading out over the earth.
Israel's 'tabernacle' is like 'palm trees that stretch out, like
gardens' that expand abundantly along river banks.

Strikingly, the Greek Old Testament translates the Hebrew of verse 6,
'like *aloes* planted by the L[ORD]{.small}', by 'as *tabernacles* \[or
tents\] pitched by the L[ORD]{.small}'. The Greek translation appears
interpretatively to identify the 'trees that stretch out like gardens'
(v. 6a) to form a veritable 'tabernacle\[s\]' (v. 6b). Is it too
speculative to say that part of the reason for the close association of
garden imagery with that of the tabernacle is due to the inextricable
link between the same images in Genesis 2, especially in view of the
echoes to the Adamic commission and Abrahamic promise in the following
verses?[7](#appen11.html#NFIN223){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN223-1 .apnf}

In this respect, it may not be inappropriate to jump ahead and take a
very brief glance at a relevant New Testament passage. The continued
reference to 'tabernacles' in the Greek Bible of Numbers 24:6 is
important to observe because the New Testament book of Hebrews (8:2)
alludes to this Greek Old Testament rendering of Numbers 24:6 to
describe 'the true tabernacle' in heaven, which it equates also with the
heavenly 'sanctuaries', also a plural reference to the one sanctuary,
just like that in Numbers 24:5, though the one in Hebrews refers to the
heavenly dimension:[8](#appen11.html#NFIN224){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN224-1
.apnf} the Messiah is 'a minister in the sanctuaries, and in the true
tabernacle, which the L[ORD]{.small} pitched, not man'. Thus, as we will
see in our later study of Hebrews, in addition to the Greek Old
Testament, we have a clear interpretation by the New Testament of the
garden language of Numbers 24:6 to be a reference to the 'tabernacle'.

The depiction of Numbers 24:5--8 is also associated with the Abrahamic
promise (cf. an increase of 'seed' in v. 7, and the 'blessing and
cursing' in v. 9 repeats Gen. 12:3b). There may also be an echo of the
original Adamic commission here (note 'king' and 'kingdom' in v. 7 and
'dominion' in v. 19).

The Aramaic Bibles of Judaism treat Numbers 24:6 along the same lines as
the Greek Old Testament. Remarkably, one Aramaic Bible
[]{#chap4.html#page_126}(*Tg. Neofiti*) understands the botanical phrase
'like aloes planted by the L[ORD]{.small}' to refer to the tabernacle:
'like the heavens which God has spread out as the house of his Shekinah
\[glorious dwelling\], so shall Israel live and endure for ever
beautiful . . . and exalted among his
creatures'.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN225){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN225-1 .apnf}
Here we have the astonishing picture of Israel's commission to spread
out over the earth being like the extension of the tabernacle of the
heavens that God spread out to house his glory. Another Aramaic Bible
(*Pseudo-Jonathon*) interprets the last phrase of verse 6 ('like cedars
beside the waters') in the following manner: 'They are exalted and
raised up over all the nations as the cedars of Lebanon which are
planted by the springs of water.'

### Ezekiel {.int_niv2}

The emerging domination of ungodly kingdoms over the world is sometimes
described with the imagery of the outgrowth of Eden's trees as a kind of
parody. Though the dominance of such kingdoms is a perversion of
humanity's commission to subdue the earth, they are portrayed with the
language of the growing primeval garden to underscore that they have
failed in executing the eschatological Adamic commission. Such
unbelieving empires plant gardens to 'enjoy the aesthetic without the
ethic'; they 'collectivize themselves . . . to seek a community without
a covenant' (Gage 1984: 60--61). Ezekiel's parody of the sinful Assyrian
world kingdom (Ezek. 31:3--16) is one of the best examples of this:

::: stroplg
^3^'Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon

With beautiful branches and forest shade,

And very high;

And its top was among the clouds.

^4^'The waters made it grow, the deep made it high.

With its rivers it continually extended all around its planting place,

[]{#chap4.html#page_127}And it sent out its channels to all the trees of
the field.

^5^'Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field,

And its boughs became many and its branches long

Because of many waters as it spread them out.

^6^'All the birds of the heavens nested in its boughs,

And under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth,

And all great nations lived under its shade.

^7^'So it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches;

For its roots extended to many waters.

^8^'The cedars in God's garden could not match it;

The cypresses could not compare with its boughs,

And the plane trees could not match its branches.

No tree in God's garden could compare with it in its beauty.

^9^'I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches,

And all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, were jealous
of it.

^10^'Therefore, thus says the Lord G[OD]{.small}, "Because it is high in
stature, and it has set its top among the clouds, and its heart is
haughty in its loftiness, ^11^therefore, I will give it into the hand of
a despot of the nations; he will thoroughly deal with it. According to
its wickedness I have driven it away. ^12^And alien tyrants of the
nations have cut it down and left it; on the mountains and in all the
valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all
the ravines of the land. And all the peoples of the earth have gone down
from its shade and left it. ^13^On its ruin all the birds of the heavens
will dwell. And all the beasts of the field will be on its fallen
branches ^14^in order that all the trees by the waters may not be
exalted in their stature, nor set their top among the clouds, nor their
well-watered mighty ones stand erect in their height. For they have all
been given over to death, to the earth beneath, among the sons of men,
with those who go down to the pit . . . ^16^ I made the nations quake at
the sound of its fall when I made it go down to Sheol with those who go
down to the pit; and all the well-watered trees of Eden, the choicest
and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the earth beneath."'
:::

Assyria is presented in the passage as growing to envelop the earth in
the way that Eden should have done (hence, Eden's trees are
[]{#chap4.html#page_128}portrayed as being envious of Assyria's arboreal
growth). However, the way Assyria accomplished the growth was unjust and
sinful. Therefore, her world-encompassing tree had to be cut down in
judgment, just as was Eden's. Daniel 4:10--12 depicts virtually the same
though more abbreviated picture of Babylon's world dominance. She is
portrayed as a huge tree in which 'was food for all'. The tree was
'visible to the end of the whole earth' and the branches spanned the
earth, so that all 'the beasts of the field found shade under it, and
the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches'. Like Assyria, the tree is
cut down in judgment because of pride and sinful disobedience to God.

The point of Ezekiel's portrayal about Assyria is to apply it to the
Egyptian kingdom and to foretell its same doom (Ezek. 31:2, 18). The
application of this world-expanding garden picture to Egypt is
intriguing in light of a fascinating feature of Egyptian religion that
we discovered in chapter 2. The Egyptians themselves believed that the
first hill of creation (i.e., their version of Eden) had been located in
Egypt and that all of creation had expanded out from their country.
Accordingly, their temples, which contained a profusion of gardenlike
scenes, symbolized such a cosmic expansion. They believed that their
kingdom should dominate and cover the world in imitation of the original
creation. The Egyptian temple was emblematic not only of past creation's
expansion but of the mandate to expand Egypt's kingdom under the
leadership of Pharaoh.

Ezekiel 17 and 19 depict Israel with the same image of the cosmic tree
that had begun to grow high from a garden but then was cut down. Unlike
Assyria, Babylon and Egypt, Israel had been directly commissioned by God
to perform the task of Genesis 1:28 by expanding their new Garden of
Eden, which, as we have seen, the Promised Land was sometimes called.
Unlike the optimistic outlook on the temple by some intertestamental
Jewish writers (e.g.,
*Sirach*),[10](#appen11.html#NFIN226){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN226-1 .apnf}
Ezekiel gives the divine 'bird's eye' view that Israel also had failed
in carrying out Adam's renewed commission. They had become as idolatrous
as the nations around them:

::: cita
^22^Thus says the Lord [GOD]{.small}, 'I shall also take a sprig from
the lofty top of the cedar and set it out; I shall pluck from the
topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I shall plant it on a high
and lofty mountain. ^23^ On the high mountain of Israel I shall plant
it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit,
[]{#chap4.html#page_129}and become a stately cedar. And birds of every
kind will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches'.
(Ezek. 17:22--23)
:::

::: stroplg
^10^'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,

Planted by the waters;

It was fruitful and full of branches

Because of abundant waters.

^11^'And it had strong branches fit for scepters of rulers,

And its height was raised above the clouds

So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.

^12^'But it was plucked up in fury;

It was cast down to the ground;

And the east wind dried up its fruit.

Its strong branch was torn off

So that it withered;

The fire consumed it.

^13^'And now it is planted in the wilderness,

In a dry and thirsty land.

^14^'And fire has gone out from its branch;

It has consumed its shoots and fruit,

So that there is not in it a strong branch,

A scepter to rule.' (Ezek. 19:10--14)
:::

In this light, and in view of our prior study of the patriarchal
altarbuilding activities, it is possible that Israel's repeated tendency
to build idolatrous altars on 'every high hill and \[under\] every leafy
tree' (Ezek. 20:28; so likewise 1 Kgs. 14:23; 2 Kgs. 17:10; Jer. 2:20;
3:6) was a sinful and perverted attempt to replicate the conditions of
Eden for which only judgment could come. Pre-exilic Israel had failed to
carry out the divine commission, and it remained for post-exilic Israel
to execute the mandate. Interestingly, Isaiah depicts eschatological
Israel as recovering the arboreal and floral features of the Garden of
Eden, so that it comes to be portrayed as a veritable 'temple
grove'.[11](#appen11.html#NFIN227){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN227-1 .apnf}

### Isaiah 54 {.int_niv2}

One of the greatest promises that restored Israel would finally obey God
and perform his will for the benefit of the world occurs in Isaiah 54.
This chapter sees that after the Babylonian exile Israel will be
[]{#chap4.html#page_130}restored and will complete the mission designed
for God's true humanity. Isaiah 54:2--3 says to the barren woman,
Jerusalem, 'Enlarge the place of *your tent* \[*'ohǒlēk*\];/Stretch out
the curtains of *your tabernacles* \[dwellings\] . . ./Lengthen your
cords,/And strengthen your pegs./For you will spread abroad to the right
and to the left./And your seed will possess \[[LXX]{.small} = inherit\]
nations.' This passage appears to develop the earlier mentioned
Abrahamic promise ('I blessed him and multiplied him', itself an
allusion to Gen. 1:28) in Isaiah 51:2, where God promises to restore and
create Israel 'like Eden . . . like the garden of the L[ORD]{.small}'
(Is. 51:3, alluding to Gen. 2). That Isaiah 51:2--3 combines references
to the Abrahamic promise (echoing Gen.
1:28)[12](#appen11.html#NFIN228){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN228-1 .apnf} and the
Garden from Genesis 2 may be a reflection of the same link inherent
originally between Genesis 1:28 and Genesis 2, for which we argued at
the beginning of chapter 3.

In addition to the possible links with Genesis 1 -- 2 via Isaiah 51,
further echoes to Genesis may also be present in Isaiah 54. Among all
the patriarchal promises, Isaiah 54:3 is a further elaboration
specifically on Genesis 28, since it is the only promise that contains
the precise wording that Abraham's 'seed' will 'spread out' to affect
the nations:[13](#appen11.html#NFIN229){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN229-1 .apnf}

In addition, Genesis 28 introduces the Bethel episode (28:10--22) with
the promise to Jacob that God would bless his 'seed', so 'that you may
possess the land of your sojournings' (Gen. 28:4), which confirms
further the allusion to Genesis 28:14 in Isaiah 54:3 (that concludes
with 'and your seed will possess
nations').[14](#appen11.html#NFIN230){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN230-1 .apnf}
The specific []{#chap4.html#page_131}allusion to Genesis 28:14 points to
the possibility that the Isaiah passage is concerned with expanding the
borders of the temple, since we have seen that, of all the patriarchal
accounts, the Bethel episode in Genesis 28 was the clearest example of
embryonic temple building with a view to further expansion. Since we
have already seen connections between Isaiah 51:2--3 (Abrahamic
blessing, multiplication, Garden of Eden) and
54:2--3,[15](#appen11.html#NFIN231){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN231-1 .apnf} it
is tempting to suggest that 51:1, which refers to God being 'the rock
from which you \[Israel\] were hewn, and . . . the excavation pit from
which you were dug', is an apt metaphor for the foundation-laying
activities of a
temple.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN232){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN232-1 .apnf}

Isaiah 54:1--3 also develops Isaiah 49:19--22. Both texts picture
Jerusalem as a 'barren' mother in exile, where she is given an abundance
of children, thus indicating her restoration and the ingathering of the
nations. Also, the influx of restored Israelites together with the
nations means that Jerusalem must be radically expanded. This growth is
explicit in 49:20, where the restored inhabitants proclaim, 'The place
is too cramped for me; make room for me that I may live here.' Isaiah
54:2--3 gives the prophetic response to this complaint: 'enlarge the
place of your tent; stretch out the curtains of your tabernacles . . .
For you will spread abroad to the right and to the
left.'[17](#appen11.html#NFIN233){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN233-1 .apnf}

The 'cramped place' in Isaiah 49:20 is either Jerusalem or perhaps the
land of Israel. On the other hand, the reference to Israel's 'tent'
(*skene* in [LXX]{.small}) in Isaiah 54:2 may connote more particularly
the 'tabernacle' (since that is its usual translation elsewhere) and its
eschatological expansion, which may well be tantamount to an expanding
latter-day Garden of Eden, which expands throughout Israel's land.
Indeed, the land itself comes to be explicitly identified
[]{#chap4.html#page_132}as Eden in Isaiah 51:3, probably because of the
widening scope of the tabernacle (the Greek Old Testament of Is. 54:2
has only *skēnē* instead of the Hebrew text's 'tent' and 'tabernacles',
thus identifying the two as the same reality). That a latter-day
tabernacle could be in mind in Isaiah 54:2 is further pointed to by
recalling that the plural 'tabernacles' (read by [MT]{.small} of Is.
54:2) elsewhere in the Old Testament can refer to Israel's one
tabernacle or temple (see above discussion of Num. 24:5).

The connections between tent, Jerusalem and Eden find confirmation in
Isaiah 33:20--21 ([LXX]{.small}), where latter-day 'Jerusalem' is 'a
rich city, *tabernacles* which shall not be shaken, *neither shall the
pins of her tabernacle* \[plausibly = Israel's future temple\] *be moved
for ever, neither shall her cords be at all broken*: for the name of the
Lord is great to you: you shall have a *place* \[*topos*\], even rivers
and wide and spacious channels'. Just as the tent of Isaiah 54:2--3 is
associated with a garden-like place (51:2--3) and a rich city
(54:11--12), so Isaiah 33 ([LXX]{.small}) presents the same picture.

That Isaiah 54:2--3 alludes to the temple is suggested further by the
observation that the majority of the ten times *topos* ('place') occurs
in direct connection to *skēnē* ('tabernacle') in the Old Testament
(Greek), the two are equated and refer to the tabernacle or temple:
Leviticus 6:9, 19; 8:31; 2 Samuel 6:17; 1 Chronicles 15:1; Psalm 41:5
(e.g., cf. 1 Chr. 15:1, 'David . . . prepared a *place* for the ark of
God, and made a *tent* for it'). Even two other references in Genesis
equate the word-pair in association with a sacred place of worship,
since the patriarchs set up altars at the 'place' where they erect a
'tent' (Gen. 13:3; 33:17--20). The other reference combining the two is
Jeremiah 10:20, which again equates the two and appears to refer to the
destruction of the temple (the [LXX]{.small} is clearer about this than
the [MT]{.small}).[18](#appen11.html#NFIN234){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN234-1
.apnf}

The image of end-time Jerusalem as a woman who has just married the Lord
(Is. 54:1, 4) and as a city with gates, foundations and walls made of
precious stones (54:11--13) enhances the possibility that Isaiah 54:2--3
alludes to an eschatological tabernacle-like temple and provided
stimulus for the expanded dimensions of John's city-temple
[]{#chap4.html#page_133}in Revelation 21. Thus, Revelation understands
Isaiah 54, partly at least, to be a prophecy of a grand end-time
city-temple.[19](#appen11.html#NFIN235){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN235-1 .apnf}

Likewise, later Jewish tradition understood Isaiah 54:1--3 to be
referring, at least in part, to Israel's
temple.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN236){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN236-1 .apnf} On
the basis of Isaiah 54:2 and Ezekiel 41:7 (both of which contexts are
alluded to in Rev. 21), some Jewish traditions expected a new Jerusalem
with radically escalated dimensions in order to hold all the redeemed
(e.g., by way of reference to Is.
54:2).[21](#appen11.html#NFIN237){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN237-1 .apnf} Other
expectations of a radically enlarged end-time Jerusalem can be found in
later Judaism.[22](#appen11.html#NFIN238){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN238-1
.apnf}

The expansion of the tabernacle in Isaiah 54:2--3 because of a
population increase is in line with our earlier discussion at the
beginning of chapter 3 that the garden sanctuary of Eden was to be
expanded by an increase in Adam's multitudinous progeny.

### Isaiah 66 {.int_niv2}

Isaiah 66:1 states, 'Thus says the L[ORD]{.small},/"Heaven is My throne,
and the earth is My footstool./Where then is a house you could build for
Me?/And where is a place that I may rest?"' The implied but unstated
answer is that *no* human structure can be adequate for God to reside
in. This passage appears to be an allusion to Solomon's prayer reported
in 2 Chronicles
6:18.[23](#appen11.html#NFIN239){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN239-1 .apnf} It is,
therefore, necessary first to review the Chronicles' passage that
records the entire account of the prayer. Solomon prays in 2 Chronicles
6:18, 'But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold,
heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain
Thee;[24](#appen11.html#NFIN240){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN240-1 .apnf} how
much less this house which I have []{#chap4.html#page_134}built.' This
prayer may imply that the earthly temple was not designed to be an
eternal structure but one which was only a temporary dwelling for God
during the Israelite theocracy. This could also be suggested from
observing that verses 32--33 say that Israel's temple had a universal
design: it was for 'foreigners' to 'pray toward this house . . . in
order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and
reverence you'.

This purpose of the temple may be formalized in Isaiah 56:7 that calls
the end-time temple 'a house of prayer for all the peoples', a passage
Jesus also will subsequently quote in highlighting the shortcomings of
Israel's second temple. We will have to wait until later to see that
this universal purpose for the nations will make the localized temple
obsolete, though we have already seen indications in Genesis 1 -- 2 and
elsewhere that the temple was meant to be expanded worldwide.

Isaiah 63:15 reinforces the notion that God's present true temple is
only in heaven: 'Look down from heaven, and see from your *lofty
dwelling place* \[*ze˘bûl* \] of holiness and glory' (i.e., the temple
in heaven) (Koehler and Baumgartner 1994: 263). The holy of holies
represented the invisible, heavenly temple and throne of God (= Is.
66:1a), and it was the actual place where the heavenly dimension
extended down to earth, that is, in Isaiah's language, it was God's
'footstool', which referred precisely to the ark of the
covenant.[25](#appen11.html#NFIN241){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN241-1 .apnf}

The desire that God's heavenly temple would descend and encompass the
earth may be expressed in Isaiah 64:1--2 (especially in the light of
63:15): 'O that Thou wouldst rend the heavens and come down, that the
mountains might quake at Thy presence \[cf. Exod. 19:18!\] . . . to make
Thy name known to Thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at Thy
presence!' This is a plea that there would be a new revelatory descent
of God's presence on analogy with his revelation at Sinai (which we have
argued was a mountain temple) and at the subsequent tabernacle at the
first Exodus to accomplish finally the divine intentions inherent in
that initial Exodus (Kissane 1943: 299). Part of these divine intentions
was that God's special revelatory presence would not be limited to the
tabernacle (and to Moses) but be extended to all of God's true people.
The universal goal of this revelation may be alluded to in Isaiah
66:18--21, where, apparently, God will make Gentiles into 'priests' and
'Levites' []{#chap4.html#page_135}(Young 1996: 535) who would serve in
the new, expanded temple. A similar prophecy that foreigners will be
priests in the temple appears in Isaiah 56:3--8.

Therefore, the future-oriented redemptive-historical 'new Exodus'
context of Isaiah 63 -- 66 (indeed, of chs. 40 -- 66) points strongly to
Isaiah 66:1 not being merely a reference to the fact that the *entire
present* cosmos is God's temple in which he dwells (*pace* Levenson
1984: 296), but that there will be a future new cosmos and temple that
God will create and in which he will dwell for ever, and which will be
an extension of the present *heavenly* temple. Additional analysis of
Isaiah 66 points further in this direction. Specifically, Isaiah 66:1--2
appears to develop 57:15:

Isaiah 57 is part of an eschatological prophecy about the temple
(developing 56:3--8). The passage appears to affirm that God will come
from his heavenly sanctuary and extend it to encompass humble saints.
Thus, Isaiah 66:1--2 is not a general theological statement detached
from redemptive history but is amplifying 57:15. In the time to come,
God will cause his heavenly temple to descend and to include 'the
afflicted and
smitten'.[26](#appen11.html#NFIN242){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN242-1 .apnf}
Consequently, Isaiah 66:2 []{#chap4.html#page_136}gives two reasons for
the implied negative answer to the preceding question in 66:1 (asked in
two different ways) about whether or not any human-made structure or any
part of the old creation could be an enduring dwelling for the eternal
God. The first reason is: 'for My hand made all these things,/Thus all
these things came into being \[by Me\]'. That is, since God is the
Creator, no particular part of his creation is big enough to contain his
presence, and certainly no part of the sin-tainted old
creation.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN243){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN243-1 .apnf}

This disjunction between the old, idolatrous world and God's coming new
world and temple is underscored by contrasting his 'humble and contrite'
people (66:2) with those who prefer to dwell with idols (66:3--5). These
idolaters profess faith but hate the true people of God, and they will
be judged by God from his heavenly temple (66:5--6). All idolatry must
be removed before the new creation is ushered in. The old 'sky will
vanish', 'the earth will wear out like a garment' (Is. 51:6), and 'all
the host of heaven will wear away' (Is. 34:4) because of sin (cf.
51:6--8, as well as 13:9--13 and 34:1--6). In contrast, God's eternal
saving presence will dwell openly again in the new 'Garden of Eden' (Is.
51:3 + 51:6--8).[28](#appen11.html#NFIN244){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN244-1
.apnf} Only an *entire new* creation can adequately house the Creator's
presence, which is why Isaiah 66:1--2 is sandwiched between two of the
most well-known new creation texts in all of the Old Testament: Isaiah
65:17 and 66:22. In fact, verses 1 and 2 are a continuation in some
manner of the new-creation prophecy that began back in
65:16.[29](#appen11.html#NFIN245){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN245-1 .apnf}

The second reason for the implied negative answer to the question of
66:1 must be seen in the light of the parallel to 57:15: in the new
creation God will enable 'the afflicted and smitten' to become part of
his new order by 'making them alive' (the Aramaic interprets this as
[]{#chap4.html#page_137}resurrected people in 57:16). Accordingly, God
also 'will dwell' with them, as he extends his heavenly temple to
include the new creation and those humans living in it. That is, not
only is everything in the old created order an inadequate container for
God's residence, but those from the old world who will be able to dwell
with him must be created anew and be made a part of the new creation.
Anticipating the events of the New Testament, one can see how suitable
it is to see 'the afflicted and smitten' Jesus as a good example of the
beginning fulfilment of this prophecy at his resurrection, as well as
his suffering servant Stephen.

That Isaiah 66:1--2 refers to an end-time temple is supported further by
Stephen's speech in Acts 7. Not coincidentally, Stephen quotes Isaiah
66:1 (Acts 7:49) as part of his answer to the charge that he had spoken
'against this holy place, and the Law' by saying that 'Jesus will
destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down . . .'
(Acts 6:13--14). This charge parallels the charge against Jesus in Mark
14:58: 'We heard Him say, "I will destroy this sanctuary made with
hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands."'
Hence, Stephen's comments relate to Jesus' building of the
eschatological temple that began with his earthly ministry and
especially his resurrection (so John 2:19--22), which in turn was an
escalated inauguration of the restoration promises to Israel, which had
begun only on a small scale with the return of a tiny remnant from
Babylon.[30](#appen11.html#NFIN246){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN246-1 .apnf}

Stephen proclaims that since Israel's physical temples were 'handmade'
(Acts 7:44--47), they could never be a permanent dwelling place for God.
His point of citing Isaiah 66:1 is to demonstrate that, just as God's
own hand created the first cosmos that had become tainted with idolatry
(cf. Acts 7:44--47 with 7:41--43 in contrast to 7:50), so God would
create a new, eternal creation and Jerusalem, not by human hands but by
his own hand (so Is. 65:17--19 and 66:22). And, Levenson has
argued[31](#appen11.html#NFIN247){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN247-1 .apnf} that
the new creation and Jerusalem in Isaiah 65:17--19 are likely equivalent
to the new temple, which may be correct. Levenson's conclusion is
pointed to further by Isaiah 66:21--23, where the coming 'new heavens
and the new earth' (v. 22) are given as the reason that God will 'take'
Gentiles 'for priests and for Levites' (v. 21). In other words, the
reason that Gentiles will be included as priests is because now the
place of true worship and temple service is not geographically located
in the old, temporal []{#chap4.html#page_138}Jerusalem but throughout
the entire earth, where 'all mankind will come to bow down before Me'
for ever (Is.
66:23).[32](#appen11.html#NFIN248){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN248-1 .apnf} This
is part of the reason inplied in Isaiah 66:2b that no earthly structure
could contain God's presence, since his presence is designed to be in
the midst of multitudes who could not fit into any human-made dwelling.

As discussed earlier, we may assume that God created the cosmos to be
his great temple in which he rested after his creative work.
Nevertheless, his special revelatory presence does not fill the entire
earth yet, since it was his intention that this goal be achieved by his
human vice-regent, whom he installed in the garden sanctuary to extend
the garden boundaries of God's presence worldwide. Adam, of course,
disobeyed this mandate, so that humanity no longer enjoyed God's
presence in the Garden, and the entire earth became infected with sin
and idolatry in a way it had not been previously, even while yet in its
still imperfected state.

Therefore, the statements about God's inability to dwell in any
structure on earth not only refers to the Creator's transcendence but
plausibly includes reference to the necessity for purification and
recreation before God's Shekinah presence, formerly restricted to heaven
and the earthly holy of holies, can dwell universally throughout
creation together with his multitudes of worshippers.

### Jeremiah 3 and related passages {.int_niv2}

We have seen in an earlier chapter that Jeremiah 3:16--18 combines the
Genesis 1:28 commission with the notion of an eschatological temple,
making plain that God's tabernacling presence would no longer be
restricted to an inner cultic room. It is instructive to cite this
passage again:

::: cita
^16^'And it shall be in those days when you *are multiplied and
increased* in the land,' declares the L[ORD]{.small}, 'they shall say no
more, "The ark of the covenant of the L[ORD]{.small}." And it shall not
come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they miss it, nor
shall it be made again.

^17^'At that time they shall call Jerusalem "The Throne of the
L[ORD]{.small}," and all the nations will be gathered to it, for the
name of the L[ORD]{.small} in Jerusalem; nor shall they walk any more
after the stubbornness of their evil heart.

[]{#chap4.html#page_139}^18^'In those days the house of Judah will walk
with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of
the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.'
:::

At the time of her end-time restoration, Israel will finally fulfil the
Genesis mandate 'to multiply and increase' (Jer. 3:16). The observation
that 'all the nations will be gathered to . . . Jerusalem' suggests that
they also will play a role in fulfilling that commission. This
fulfilment is combined with a promise of a future temple, but one that
will not be like Israel's prior temples. Not even the centrepiece of the
old temple, the ark of the covenant, will exist in the renovated
Jerusalem. Rather, the Lord's presence alone will be the new temple. The
ark represented the special manifestation of God's sovereign presence
that stretched to earth from heaven. The ark is repeatedly called God's
'footstool' (1 Chr. 28:2; Pss. 99:5; 132:7). Various Old Testament
passages picture God to be sitting on a throne in heaven with his feet
resting on the ark as his footstool in the earthly temple: Isaiah 66:1,
'heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool' (also 2 Kgs. 19:15;
Lam. 2:1). A 'footstool' was attached to Solomon's 'throne' (2 Chr.
9:18), which was modelled after the idea that the ark was the footstool
of God's throne in heaven.

Thus, the ark and God's heavenly throne were inseparably bound
together.[33](#appen11.html#NFIN249){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN249-1 .apnf}
Jeremiah does not say that a sacred structure *in* Jerusalem will be
built but that the future Jerusalem in its entirety will be called 'the
throne of the L[ORD]{.small}' because the essence of the old temple, the
divine rule, will be expressed in an unfettered way at the end time.
'*All* the city will have become throne, and hence there will be no
further need for a *separate throne*' (i.e., an 'ark' representing the
throne) (Woudstra 1970: 97, my emphasis). The same reality is probably
indicated in Ezekiel 40 -- 48, where the ark is absent from the temple
and the vision climaxes with the statement that the new Jerusalem will
be called 'the L[ORD]{.small} is there' (48:35). This finds a parallel
in the Ancient Near East, where description of a Sumerian 'temple' is
referred to twice as 'indeed, it is a city, who knows its interior?'
(*Keš Temple Hymn*, lines 58--59 in Sjöberg et al. 1969: 170--171).

Almost identically, Isaiah 4:5 states that at the end-time the whole
area of Zion will become a sanctuary: 'the L[ORD]{.small} will create
over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by
day, []{#chap4.html#page_140}even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming
fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy'. That Isaiah 4
refers to the entire area of Jerusalem becoming a
tabernacle[34](#appen11.html#NFIN250){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN250-1 .apnf} is
apparent from recalling that the 'fire' and 'cloud' were expressions of
God's presence both at Sinai (which we have seen was a mountain temple)
and in the tabernacle (Num. 9:15--16), and 'canopy' is an apt synonym
for 'tabernacle' (Woudstra 1970: 98--99). Isaiah 4:6 further points to
this connection by referring to the 'canopy' as a *sukkâ* ('booth'),
which can be a synonym for 'tabernacle' (2 Sam. 11:11; cf. Ps. 31:20;
Acts 15:16--18, quoting Amos 9:11--12).

The early Jewish apocalypse of *2 Baruch* also foresees a similar
reality: God showed to Moses 'the end of time . . . and then further,
also the likeness of Zion with its measurements which was to be made
after the likeness of the present sanctuary' (*2 Baruch* 59:4).
Latter-day Zion[35](#appen11.html#NFIN251){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN251-1
.apnf} was to be constructed according to the pattern of the tabernacle,
which is close to the idea expressed in Jeremiah 3. Comparably, Ezekiel
37:24--28 suggests, as we have observed in the previous chapter, that
the eschatological 'sanctuary' will not only extend over Jerusalem but
all of Israel's land of promise (as 37:24--25 implies; cf. esp. 37:27:
'My dwelling place also shall be over \[preposition *̒al* \] them')
(Woudstra 1970: 98). Ezekiel 37:28 even mentions a worldwide effect of
the temple, since as a result of the establishment of the temple 'the
nations will know that I am the L[ORD]{.small}'.

The reason the ark in the temple will have waned in significance when
the Genesis 1:28 commission is finally fulfilled is that there will be a
greater temple than a mere physical one, not only expanding to encompass
all of Jerusalem (thus the point of Jer. 3:17) but the whole world, as
texts analysed throughout this segment testify. This future temple will
be so incomparably greater than the former that God's people will not
even 'remember it nor shall they miss it' (Jer. 3:16). Furthermore, a
physical ark within a small localized temple 'shall not be made again'
because everything to which it pointed has been realized. Haggai 2:9
describes this same reality by saying 'the latter glory of this house'
will be 'greater than the former'. In this light, Jeremiah 3 is
affirming that once the greater glory of the eschatological temple
[]{#chap4.html#page_141}comes, one will not focus on the lesser glory of
the earlier temple, much less should one ever desire to rebuild
it.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN252){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN252-1 .apnf}

The phrase found in Jeremiah 3:16 'and it shall not come to mind, nor
shall they remember it' (with minor variants) is a way elsewhere of
saying that the greatness of the coming new creation will diminish the
memory of the former temple, Jerusalem, and old creation to a distant
memory, an afterthought. For example, after Isaiah 54:1--3 speaks of the
worldwide expansion of the tabernacle, in verse 4 it adds, 'but *you
will forget* the shame of your youth, and the reproach of your widowhood
*you will remember no more*'! That is, Israel's time of captivity would
be incomparable to the coming restoration of her new temple (54:1--3)
and new city (54:11--12) and of her own new creation (cf. 54:5 with
54:9--10). Isaiah 65:17--18 affirms the same reality: '*For behold, I
create new heavens and a new earth*;/And the former things *shall not be
remembered or come to mind*./But be glad and rejoice forever in what I
create;/*For behold, I create Jerusalem* for rejoicing,/And her people
for gladness.'

The same wording of 'not remembering or coming to mind' occurs as in
Jeremiah 3:16, and it is applied to the coming new creation. The future
new world will be so incomparable to the old world and its captivity
that God's people will no longer focus on the 'former things'.
Strikingly, these verses in Isaiah 65 do not appear to be speaking of a
new Jerusalem to be created in one geographical area of the new
creation. Rather, the prophesied 'new heavens and a new earth' of verse
17 may even be equated with the creation of the new Jerusalem in verse
18 (note the parallelism: 'For behold, I create' in both verses 17a and
18a).[37](#appen11.html#NFIN253){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN253-1 .apnf} Our
earlier analysis of Isaiah 54:1--3 confirms such an expansive
understanding of the future Jerusalem in 65:17--18. Isaiah 43:18--19a
also uses a similar negation to contrast the former creation with the
new: '*Do not call to mind the former things,/Or ponder things of the
past*./Behold, I will do something new,/Now it will spring forth;/Will
you not be aware of it?/I will even make a roadway in the
wilderness/Rivers in the desert.'

Therefore, when this emphatic negation of not remembering former
realities occurs in restoration contexts, it refers to the contrast
between the greatness of the coming new creation (especially the
[]{#chap4.html#page_142}expanded new Jerusalem) and Israel's former city
or temple. That such an expanded Jerusalem may be implied by Jeremiah
3:16--17 is suggested not only by its links to Isaiah's new creation
texts but also by realizing that a new Jerusalem the size of the old one
would not be large enough to contain 'all the nations' who 'will be
gathered' to it in the last
days.[38](#appen11.html#NFIN254){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN254-1 .apnf}

We will observe toward the end of this chapter the same irresistible
implication in the early Jewish work of *1 Enoch* 90 and its portrayal
of an expanded end-time temple. The same universal implication arises
from recalling that Jeremiah 3:16--17 also promises that the Genesis
1:28 commission will finally come to pass when Israelites and 'all the
nations' will 'be multiplied and increased' (so cf. v. 16 with v. 17) to
accomplish the goal of 'filling the earth' (Gen. 1:28) and 'ruling . . .
over all the earth' (Gen. 1:26). Just as a significant increase in
population would have necessitated an expansion of the first temple in
Eden following upon the first couple's obedience, so it is that when
God's people at last do what Adam and Eve should have done, an expansion
of the temple and Jerusalem will be required. This conclusion coalesces
with our assessment about Isaiah 4:5, Ezekiel 37:26--28 and Isaiah
54:2--3, which respectively refer to the tabernacle extending over
Jerusalem, the land of promise and the entire earth. The last two
passages even develop the original Genesis 1:28 commission.

### Zechariah 1 and 2 {.int_niv2}

Zechariah 1:16 predicts that God 'will return to Jerusalem' and that his
'house will be built in it . . . and a measuring line will be stretched
over Jerusalem'. The stretching out of the 'measuring line' after
mention of building the temple refers most likely to the construction of
the temple on a grander scale than formerly; that is, over the entire
site of latter-day Jerusalem. This fits well with Ezekiel 40 -- 46,
where an angelic figure repeatedly 'measures' the dimensions of the
temple that the prophet sees in a
vision.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN255){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN255-1 .apnf}
Zechariah 2 begins with a vision of 'a man with a measuring line in his
hand'. His purpose is 'to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and
how long it is' (2:2). The point of this vision is explained in verse 4:
'Jerusalem will be inhabited without []{#chap4.html#page_143}walls,
because of the multitude of men and cattle within it'. Apparently, the
borders of old Jerusalem will be expanded to make room for the many
people and their possessions that will dwell in it in the future.

The reason there will be no walls is that the Lord 'will be a wall of
fire around her, and . . . be the glory in her midst' (2:5). Thus,
Zechariah speaks not merely about the enlargement of Jerusalem but
refers to its entirety as a holy sanctuary in which God's flaming glory
will reside. Quite like Jeremiah 3:16--17, the Shekinah presence of God,
formerly sequestered in the old holy of holies, will burst forth from
the heavenly sanctuary and encompass the entire future new Jerusalem.
Zechariah 14:20--21 also suggests that the holiness, which was formerly
restricted to the temple, will spread throughout the future new
Jerusalem and Judah. 'God's fiery presence fills the eternal city to its
unwalled limits . . . it is in its entirety a temple, hence has no
temple within it' (Kline 2001: 76).

In response to this prophetic vision, captive Israel is exhorted to come
out of captivity (2:6--7) because God has determined that they return to
Zion and from there to 'spread them out as the four winds of the
heavens' (Kline 2001: 79). These commands again echo the commission that
Israel, as a corporate Adam, must spread out to subdue the earth and
fill it with his glory. God will judge Israel's captors, which
implicitly means their deliverance (2:8--9). Israel is to rejoice
because God 'will dwell in' Israel's 'midst' when they return (2:10).
The 'multitude of men' that will necessitate Jerusalem's enlargement in
2:4 is now defined in 2:11 as 'many nations' who 'will join themselves
to the L[ORD]{.small} . . . and will become *My
people*'*.*[40](#appen11.html#NFIN256){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN256-1 .apnf}
In addition, 2:11 repeats the theme from 2:10 that God 'will dwell in
your \[Israel's\] midst'. The repeated Hebrew verb 'dwell' (*šākan*) is
the typical word used for God's 'dwelling' in the tabernacle, and the
noun form of the verb is rendered 'tabernacle' throughout the Old
Testament.

The point is that Zechariah 2:11 has come full circle back to the
introductory note about the temple in 1:16. God will construct his
future temple on a huge scale, and his tabernacling presence will reside
with both Jews and Gentiles who trust in
him.[41](#appen11.html#NFIN257){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN257-1 .apnf} The last
phrase []{#chap4.html#page_144}of Zechariah 2 ('for he is aroused from
his holy habitation') suggests that his coming judgment has begun or is
imminent, and his heavenly tabernacling presence will descend once again
and fill Israel in a greater way than ever before.

::: {#chap4.html#niv2-045 .niv2}
### Daniel 2: an expanding worldwide kingdom {.int_niv2}

Also relevant for consideration is Daniel 2:34--35, 44--45, though there
is no apparent explicit reference to a temple but only God's kingdom.
King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that no-one save Daniel could interpret.
In his dream the king saw a giant statue of a man consisting of four
sections. Daniel explained that this represented four kingdoms on the
earth, the last of which would be destroyed:

::: cita
^34^'You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and
it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.

^35^'Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were
crushed all at the same time, and became like chaff from the summer
threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of
them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great
mountain and filled the whole earth.'
:::

Daniel interprets the climax of the king's vision to mean that God would
destroy the last evil kingdom of world history and would establish his
own kingdom for ever: 'And in the days of those kings God will set up a
kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left
for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms,
but it will itself endure forever' (Dan. 2:44).

Daniel 2 sees that God's kingdom will permeate the entire earth: the
'stone' that became a 'great mountain . . . filled the whole earth'. The
notion of God's kingdom 'filling the whole earth' appears to echo
Genesis 1:26, 28, where God commissions Adam to 'fill the earth' and to
'rule . . . over all the earth'. Further evidence of a Daniel 2 allusion
to Genesis 1:28 appears in Daniel 2:38, where Daniel says that God has
given the Babylonian king rule over 'the birds of the sky and the fish
of the sea', almost verbatim with the Greek Old Testament of Genesis
1:28.[42](#appen11.html#NFIN258){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN258-1 .apnf} (We
have also seen the warped []{#chap4.html#page_145}universal kingdoms of
Assyria and Egypt portrayed by Ezekiel with language from Genesis 1 and
2.)[43](#appen11.html#NFIN259){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN259-1 .apnf}
:::

::: {#chap4.html#niv2-046 .niv2}
### Daniel 2 in the light of other Old Testament passages: an expanding worldwide temple {.int_niv2}

André Lacocque has made the tantalizing suggestion that the 'stone . . .
cut out without hands' of Daniel 2 'represents Mount Zion, the Temple
not built by human hands' (Lacocque 1979: 124; see also 49). Other than
offering parallels where 'the symbolism of a mountain is applied to
Israel' (e.g., Is. 2:2--3; Ezek. 40:2), Lacocque does not adduce any
substantial evidence supporting his proposal (1979: 49). Nevertheless,
there are some indications that Daniel's stone-mountain may, indeed, be
closely associated with a gigantic temple.

First, not only does Isaiah 2:2--3 utilize a 'mountain' to symbolize
Israel, but the image is integrally connected to the temple, 'the
mountain of the house of the Lord'.

Second, such a close link between mountain and temple is made throughout
the Old Testament, so that Mount Zion is sometimes merely referred to as
'mountain', 'hill' or other like image. These ways of speaking about
Mount Zion either closely associate it or virtually equate it with the
temple as a synecdoche of the whole for the
part[44](#appen11.html#NFIN260){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN260-1 .apnf} (the
entire mountain is substituted for the top part where the temple is
located). For example, repeatedly such phrases occur as 'mountain of the
house' (Jer. 26:18; Mic. 4:1), 'holy mountain' (about 16 times), 'holy
hill' (Pss. 15:1; 43:3; 99:9; Jer. 31:23) and 'temple hill' (1 Maccabees
13:52; 16:20). Sometimes these references are equated with the temple in
the following context: e.g., in Isaiah 66: 20 'holy mountain' = 'house
of the L[ORD]{.small}'; in Psalm 15:1 'holy hill' = 'your tent'; in
Psalm 24:3 'hill of the L[ORD]{.small}'= 'His holy place' (cf. also Ps.
43:3).

Thus, 'mountain', when referring to Zion, often includes reference
[]{#chap4.html#page_146}to the
temple.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN261){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN261-1 .apnf} Among
the best illustrations of this is Isaiah 2:2--3 and Micah 4:1--2 which
equate 'the mountain of the house of the L[ORD]{.small}' with 'the
mountain of the L[ORD]{.small} . . . the house of the God of Jacob'
(Mic. 4:1--2 is identical). The description of the mountain in Daniel 2
rings with the same intonations of these descriptions in Isaiah and
Micah.

Enhancing this point is the observation that every temple associated
with God's people in the Old Testament is on a 'mountain': Ezekiel
28:13--14, 16, and 18 refers to 'Eden, the garden of God . . . the holy
mountain of God', and also refers to it as containing
'sanctuaries'\![46](#appen11.html#NFIN262){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN262-1
.apnf} As we have seen, the patriarchal small-scale temples were all on
mountains, and Mount Sinai appears to have been conceived of as a
temple. Furthermore, the pattern of the tabernacle was given to Moses on
Sinai (Exod. 25:9, 40), and the impermanent tabernacle pointed to the
final temple on Mount
Zion.[47](#appen11.html#NFIN263){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN263-1 .apnf}
Additionally, it is clear that the eschatological temple was to be
situated on a mountain (Ezek. 40:2; Rev. 21:10). In line with these
precedents, Daniel also portrays a mountain to be created at the end of
time.

Third, what is further attractive about linking Daniel 2 and Isaiah
2:2--3 (= Mic. 4:1--2) as temple texts is that both are introduced as
containing events that are to occur 'in the last days' (Dan. 2:28 \[so
also Dan. 2:29, [LXX]{.small}\] and Is. 2:2; Mic. 4:1). Micah even
[]{#chap4.html#page_147}equates 'the mountain of the house of the
L[ORD]{.small}' (4:1) with God's eternal kingdom, the latter an explicit
element of the mountain in Daniel 2: 'the L[ORD]{.small} will reign over
them in Mount Zion . . . forever' (Mic. 4:7). Exodus 15:17--18 also
equates 'the mountain of Thine inheritance' with 'the place, O
L[ORD]{.small}, which Thou hast made for thy dwelling . . . the
sanctuary', from where 'the Lord will reign forever and ever'.

Fourth, both Isaiah 2:2--3 and Micah 4:1--2 portray the mountain on
which the temple sits as growing: it 'will be raised above the hills'.
While this is not as explicit as Daniel's rock that becomes a mountain
and fills the earth, neither is it far from that picture. Both the
Daniel and Isaiah-Micah passages reverberate with echoes of new
creation, since they are so eschatologically oriented. The image of an
emerging new creation may be perceived in the depiction of a growing
holy mountain, since the emergence of mountains was certainly a feature
of the original creation.

In this regard, the paradisal garden imagery of Micah 4:4 is not
unexpected in a passage that has just pictured a latter-day
temple-mountain, especially since Eden was a garden on a mountain (as we
have just seen in Ezek. 28:14, 16, 18, which is to be compared with Mic.
4:4: 'And each of them will sit under his vine and under his fig tree,
with no one to make them afraid') (Stordalen 2000: 426--428). Thus,
primal history is repeated in eschatological history (*Barnabas* 6:13
says, 'Behold, I make the last things as the first'). Neither is Isaiah
unfamiliar with an eschatological arbor-like temple atmosphere: 'The
glory of Lebanon will come to you,/The juniper, the box tree, and the
cypress together,/To beautify the place of My sanctuary,/And I shall
make the place of My feet \[the ark of the covenant\] glorious' (Is.
60:13).

Fifth, one final observation points to the Daniel 2 stone being the
foundation of a mountain-temple. Could the reference to a mountain
growing out of the place of a 'threshing floor' (Dan. 2:35) be a subtle
allusion to the episode narrated in 2 Chronicles
3:1?[48](#appen11.html#NFIN264){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN264-1 .apnf} The
Chronicles text reads, 'Then Solomon began to build the house of the
L[ORD]{.small} in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the L[ORD]{.small}
had appeared to his father David . . . on the *threshing floor* of Ornan
the Jebusite.' This 'threshing floor' is referred to four times in 1
Chronicles 24:16--24 and []{#chap4.html#page_148}five times in the
parallel of 1 Chronicles
21:15--28.[49](#appen11.html#NFIN265){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN265-1 .apnf}
There David saw 'the angel of the L[ORD]{.small} standing between earth
and heaven' (1 Chr. 21:16), and at that site 'David built an altar to
the L[ORD]{.small} . . . and offered burnt offerings . . . And he called
to the L[ORD]{.small}' (1 Chr. 21:26). In addition, David calls the
place 'the house of the L[ORD]{.small} God' (1 Chr. 22:1). As we
discussed, these are all the same elements found with the small-scale
temple-building activities of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This Davidic
episode mirrors the account of Jacob in particular, where also God and
angels appear to him and a link between 'earth' and 'heaven' is
highlighted.

The reason that David performed priestly activities in an informal
sanctuary was twofold, as we saw in the preceding chapter. First,
because from that very site the temple of Israel was to be built, and,
second, because the 1 Chronicles 21 passage goes on to say that 'the
tabernacle . . . which Moses had made . . . and the altar of burnt
offering were in . . . Gibeon at that time' (21:29). This second
observation suggests not only that, because of the immediacy of the
situation, he was unable to go to Gibeon to offer sacrifices at the
properly designated cultic place, but that a transition from the
tabernacle to the temple was occurring. Mount Moriah was being
designated as the new place for sacrifice because the temple would
imminently be constructed there.

Perhaps, it is not coincidental, keeping in mind the stone-mountain of
Daniel 2:34--35, that during this same episode David begins preparations
for construction of the temple by arranging that 'stonecutters . . . hew
out stones to build the house of God' (1 Chr. 22:2).

### Daniel 2 in the light of the Ancient Near East and Judaism: an expanding worldwide temple and new creation {.int_niv2}

Daniel's picture of an expanding mountain is compatible with Ancient
Near Eastern cosmogonies that sometimes portray a hillock arising amidst
the chaos seas as the bridgehead of a new creation, as we have already
observed in Egyptian
mythology.[50](#appen11.html#NFIN266){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN266-1 .apnf}
For instance, the []{#chap4.html#page_149}beginning of the Egyptian Sun
god's (Re's) rule at the beginning of creation is identified with the
emergence of a 'primeval hillock': 'Re began to appear as king . . .
when he was on the \[primeval\] hill which is in
Hermopolis.'[51](#appen11.html#NFIN267){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN267-1 .apnf}
Egyptian pyramids were analogues of such primeval hillocks (Pritchard
1969: 3). We need to remember that just as the primordial hillock was
thought to have expanded to form the entire earth, so temples were
constructed to memorialize symbolically this initial creation: hillocks
were depicted in the back of temples and the temple structure from that
point was built in an ever-widening, expansive design. That successive
Pharaohs actually expanded the borders of the temples' sacred space also
symbolically memorialized the expansion of the original creation. We
also saw at the beginning of chapter 3 a somewhat similar phenomenon in
Babylonian temple mythology.

We have already argued that Adam was to extend the hospitable part of
new creation in Mount Eden into the inhospitable world (for the location
of Eden on a mountain, see Ezek. 28:13--16). The same principle may be
reflected in the second creation episode, where the first land that
emerges from the waters is the tip of a mountain, on which Noah's ark
comes to rest,[52](#appen11.html#NFIN268){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN268-1
.apnf} and from where Noah and his family were to repopulate the earth.
Judaism also held that the 'world was \[started\] created from Zion . .
. the world was created from its centre' when God 'cast a stone into the
ocean, from which the world then was founded' (*b. Yoma* 54b). This
stone became 'the foundation stone with which the Lord of the world
sealed the mouth of the great deep from the beginning' (*Tg.
Pseudo-Jonathon Exodus* 28:29), from which new land emerged and spread
out until the main land-mass of the creation was
formed.[53](#appen11.html#NFIN269){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN269-1 .apnf} While
it is unlikely historically true that Zion was the place from which the
land of the original creation expanded, this Jewish reference probably
reflects the notion that the building of Israel's temple marked the
beginning of a new creation. In this new creation Israel was to function
as a kind of corporate []{#chap4.html#page_150}Adam in their renewed
Garden of Eden and spread out from there, reflecting God's glory in
obedience to the commission of Genesis 1:28. History was starting over
again, and Israel was the crown even of the human creation.

The Ancient Near East sometimes pictured the construction of a temple as
the growing of a mountain from a stone and linked it with the dominion
of the kingdom in which the temple started its growth. This is well
illustrated by the Sumerian Cylinders of Gudea that commemorate king
Gudea's building and dedication of a temple for the god Ningirsu in
Lagash, which we have had occasion already briefly to discuss in
chapter 2:

Here, with almost identical language, we have all the elements of Daniel
2 and Isaiah 2. This depiction was not unique among the Sumerian temple
portrayals. Another temple hymn says that the temple was a 'mountain'
that 'has grown high, (uniting) heaven and earth' (Janowski 2001: 236).
Still another Sumerian temple portrayal (the *Keš Temple Hymn*)
describes the 'Keš temple' as a 'foundation' that was 'growing up like a
mountain, embracing the sky' and as a 'great temple, reaching the sky'
(Sjöberg et al. 1969: 167, 169). This Sumerian account shows that it
would have been natural for the ancient mind to associate the mention of
a foundation 'stone \[or brick of a temple\] cut out of a mountain' and
a mountain that is a temple which grows and 'fills' the cosmos,
indicating the sovereign dominion of a king and his
people.[54](#appen11.html#NFIN270){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN270-1 .apnf}

As in the depiction of King Gudea's temple, mention of 'cutting out
stones from a mountain' for Israel's temple also occurs repeatedly: 1
Kings 5:15--17 says that from 'the mountains . . . they quarried great
stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut
stones' (see also 1 Chr. 22:2; 2 Chr. 2:18). Israel's second temple also
commenced with the laying of a foundational 'top stone' (Zech. 4:7). Not
only can 'mountain' be a reference to Israel's temple but so can 'stone'
or 'rock'.[55](#appen11.html#NFIN271){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN271-1 .apnf}
Since mountains were also associated with temples specifically in
Babylon (note the ziggurats), it is appropriate that such a cultic
mountain would be revealed in vision to the king of Babylon in Daniel
2,[56](#appen11.html#NFIN272){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN272-1 .apnf} portraying
to him the true divine []{#chap4.html#page_152}temple mount in contrast
to the false Babylonian pretenders, as well as to similar Egyptian
pretenders that would likely have been known in Babylon.
:::

::: {#chap4.html#niv2-048 .niv2}
### Daniel 2 in the light of a glimpse forward to the New Testament: an end-time temple {.int_niv2}

Further indication that the 'stone' of Daniel 2 is associated with a
temple-like image comes from the gospels which allude to this Old
Testament passage: 'The stone which the builders rejected, This became
the chief corner stone \[i.e., of the
temple\][57](#appen11.html#NFIN273){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN273-1 .apnf} . .
. Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on
whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust' (Luke 20:17--18 =
Matt. 21:42, 44).[58](#appen11.html#NFIN274){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN274-1
.apnf}

Possibly also another link between the stone-mountain of Daniel 2 and
the eschatological temple is that both are not made by human hands.
Again, it is the New Testament that repeatedly refers to the new,
end-time temple as 'not made with hands' (see Mark
14:58;[59](#appen11.html#NFIN275){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN275-1 .apnf} 2 Cor.
5:1; Heb. 9:11, 24; cf. Acts 7:48). The Old Testament image
corresponding closest to this is Daniel's stone 'cut out without
hands'.[60](#appen11.html#NFIN276){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN276-1 .apnf} For
instance, Hebrews 9:11 says that Christ entered 'through the greater and
more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of
this creation'. Accordingly, Acts 17:24 affirms that 'the God who made
the world and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth,
does not dwell in temples made with hands'. Paul says this after the
great redemptive--historical divide when Christ and his people had begun
to replace Israel's 'handmade' temple. There could be no human-made
structures separating God and his people in order that he dwell fully
and unfettered with them. This is why no human can answer affirmatively
God's question in Isaiah about his eschatological, eternal dwelling,
'Where then is a house you could build for me?' (Is. 66:1). Thus, God's
perfect heavenly dwelling, which would eventually descend and encompass
the entire earth, could never be altered or changed by human hands
(*Odes of Solomon* 4:1--3).

God's intention as the Creator is one day to fill every part of his
creation with his presence. God's holy presence could not dwell fully in
the old creation because it was a sin-tainted and idolatrous world,
[]{#chap4.html#page_153}which we have also seen is an implication of
Isaiah 66:1--2. Hence, his special revelatory presence dwelt in a
limited and temporary manner in human-made structures. But when he would
fully redeem the world and recreate it (so Rom. 8:18--25), he would
dwell in it in a fuller way than ever before.

Even before the early Christian evidence, Daniel's stone 'not cut by
human hands' (Dan. 2:34, 45) may have resonated with cultic implications
because the only other places in the Old Testament where 'uncut stones'
are mentioned is in Exodus, Deuteronomy and Joshua, where Israel was to
build 'an altar of *uncut stones* \[literally 'whole stones'\], on which
no man had wielded an iron tool', and 'they offered burnt offerings . .
. and sacrificed peace
offerings'.[61](#appen11.html#NFIN277){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN277-1 .apnf}
Similarly, 1 Kings 6:7 says that Solomon's temple 'was built of stone
*prepared at the quarry*, *and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any
iron tool* heard in the house while it was being built'.

Interestingly, the *Sibylline Oracles*, a Jewish work (c. [AD]{.small}
80), affirms a similar notion to that of the above passages speaking of
temples 'not made with hands' (likewise also cf. *4 Ezra* 13:6--7,
35--36, alluding to Dan. 2:34, 45 and *2 Enoch* 22:1). Perhaps as a
result of contemplating the recent destruction of Jerusalem's temple in
[AD]{.small} 70, this text asserts: 'the great God, whom no hands of men
fashioned . . . does not have a house, a stone set up as a temple . . .
but one which it is not possible to see from the earth nor to measure
with mortal eyes, since it was not fashioned by mortal hand' (*Sibylline
Oracles* 4:11). Consequently, God's true people 'will reject all temples
when they see them; altars too, useless foundations of dumb stones'
(*Sibylline Oracles* 4:27--28). Even pagans seemed to perceive this
truth: 'What house built by craftsmen could enclose the form divine
within enfolding walls?' (Euripides, *Fragment*
968).[62](#appen11.html#NFIN278){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN278-1 .apnf}

In the light of the evidence adduced so far in this section and the
preceding three, Daniel 2 likely speaks of an eternal kingdom, which is
also portrayed as a huge mountain-temple.
:::

::: {#chap4.html#niv2-049 .niv2}
### Psalm 72: an expanding worldwide kingdom {.int_niv2}

Finally, Psalm 72, though lacking any specific reference to the temple,
speaks of an ideal eschatological Israelite king who defeats enemies
(72:9--11) and establishes the borders of his rule around the earth:
[]{#chap4.html#page_154}'May he also rule from sea to sea, And from the
river to the ends of the earth' (72:8; so likewise Ps. 2:6--9!). Verse
17 (71:17, [LXX]{.small}) alludes to Genesis 28:14 and 12:2--3 ('I will
. . . make your name great and . . . I will bless those who bless you .
. . and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed'): 'May
his name increase . . . And let men bless themselves by him; let all the
nations call him
blessed'.[63](#appen11.html#NFIN279){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN279-1 .apnf} The
universal extension of the king's rule and blessing (72:8, 17) is also
part of the allusion to Genesis 28:14: 'Your descendants shall also be
like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread out to the west and to
the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your seed
shall all the families of the earth be blessed' (cf. also Gen. 13:15).

The statements of the king's worldwide rule and domination of enemies
together with the divine blessing also echo Genesis
1:28.[64](#appen11.html#NFIN280){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN280-1 .apnf}
Psalm 72:19 gives the ultimate goal of the king's rule and of the
blessing 'may the whole earth be filled with His \[God's\] glory', which
we have argued is the final goal of Genesis 1:28 and its reapplications
to God's people throughout the Old Testament. Though the psalm does not
mention the sanctuary, its development of Genesis 1:28, 12:2--3, and
28:14 fits admirably with our other findings concerning the worldwide
nature of the eschatological sanctuary.

## Views of early Jewish commentators {.int_niv1}

In addition to the above references in the Old Testament, early Jewish
authors also elaborate explicitly and implicitly on how the borders of
Eden and the temple were to be enlarged and to spread throughout the
earth. We have alluded only to a few such writings in the preceding part
of this chapter. The purpose in this section is to focus on them. The
following Jewish writings represent interpretative insights and organic
developments of some of the Old Testament passages and themes that we
have discussed above.

::: {#chap4.html#niv2-050 .niv2}
### The Dead Sea Scrolls (second century BC -- first century AD) {.int_niv2}

First, consider an important text from column 6 of the early Jewish
Qumran community's *Hymn Scroll*.

::: stroplg
[]{#chap4.html#page_155}^12^ . . . And all the nations shall know Thy
truth

And all the peoples, Thy glory . . .

^14^ . . . And Thou hast sent out

^15^a sprouting

as a flower that shall bloom for ever,

that the Shoot may grow into the branches of the eternal planting.

And its shade shall spread over all \[the earth\]

\[and\] its \[top\]

^16^reach up to the hea\[vens\]

\[and\] its roots go down to the
Abyss.[65](#appen11.html#NFIN281){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN281-1 .apnf}

And all the rivers of Eden \[shall water\] its \[bou\]ghs and it shall
become a \[mi\]ghty

^17^forest,

\[and the glory of\] its \[fo\]rest shall spread over the world without
end,

as far as Sheol \[for ever\].

\[And\] it shall be a well-spring of light as an

^18^eternal unfailing fountain.

In its brilliant flames

All the son\[s of darkness\] shall be consumed . . .

^19^ . . . And they that participated in my testimony . . .

\[. . . have not held fast\] to the service of righteousness.
:::

This passge (1QH 6.12--19) compares the Qumran saints to an Edenic tree
with a 'well-spring of light' and 'brilliant flames', which is directly
linked to the 'testimony' (!) of the Teacher of Righteousness (1QS
8.5--6 speaks likewise of the DSS community as 'an everlasting planting
. . . the House of holiness for Israel and the Council of the Holy of
Holies', who are to be '*witnesses* of truth'). A few sections later the
*Hymn Scroll* identifies the Qumran community as the place where
'salvation' will 'flower' and the 'Shoot . . . grow' (1QH 7.19) and as
'the fruitful planting' and 'the glorious Eden', which 'shall bear
fr\[uit for ever\]' (1QH 8.20, though cf. all of 8.4--23, which contains
many allusions to Eden's fertility).

Accordingly, another Qumran writing (4QFlor 1.6) says that 'a sanctuary
of Adam \[or mankind\]' (*miqdaš 'ādām*) will be built in the
[]{#chap4.html#page_156}midst of the
community.[66](#appen11.html#NFIN282){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN282-1 .apnf} In
this respect, we have already observed that the seven lamps on the
temple lampstand may well have inspired the hymnist's affirmation in 1QH
7.24, 'I will shine with a *seven-fold li* \[*ght*\] in the *E*
\[*den*[67](#appen11.html#NFIN283){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN283-1 .apnf}
which\] Thou has \[m\]ade for Thy glory' (my italics). This 'shining' is
an expression of establishing 'dominion . . . over the sons \[of the
ear\]th' (1QH 7.23), which alludes to the theme of universality, again
in conjunction with the garden. Thus, the end-time temple of Eden had
been established among the Qumran covenanters, to which another Dead Sea
Scroll document attests in fulfilment of the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 temple
prophecy: God 'built for them a sure House in Israel such as did not
exist from former times till now. They who cling to it' will have 'all
the glory of Adam' (CD
3.19--20).[68](#appen11.html#NFIN284){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN284-1 .apnf}

Of special note in the *Hymn Scroll* text just quoted (1QH 6.15--17) is
that not only does it compare the Essene community to the tree of Eden
that God has planted in the past but that the tree's 'shade shall spread
over all \[the earth\] \[and\] its \[top\] reach up to the hea\[vens\] .
. . And all the rivers of Eden \[shall water\] its \[bou\]ghs and it
shall become a \[mi\]ghty forest, \[and the glory of\] its \[fo\]rest
shall spread over the world without end'. The new Eden's tree will grow
its branches over the entire globe and its shade accordingly will spread
until the earth is under a massive arboreal-like tabernacle, filled not
with literal shade but with divine glory. The metaphorical outgrowth of
the tree is not only associated with Qumran's 'testimony' and 'witness'
but a picture of the previously stated notion that 'all the nations will
know Thy truth and all the peoples, Thy glory' (1QH 6.12).

Similarly, 1QH 8.20--22 repeats, though not as explicitly, the portrait
of 6.12--19:

::: stroplg
^20^. . . But the fruitful planting \[shall prosper\],

\[and it shall become an\] everlasting \[fount\]ain for the glorious
Eden

[]{#chap4.html#page_157}and shall bear fr\[uit for ever\].

^21^And Thou hast opened their fountain by my hand

among the \[water\] courses,

\[and Thou hast disposed\] . . . the planting

^22^of their trees . . . to stre\[ngthen it and cause\] a glorious
branch to \[gro\]w.
:::

We see in these early Jewish hymnic texts an interpretation of the tree
of life that understands Eden to have universal eschatological
significance[69](#appen11.html#NFIN285){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN285-1 .apnf}
similar, as we will see, to the depiction in the last vision of
Revelation (cf. Rev. 22:1--5 with 21:1--27). The Qumran community
extends its figurative arboreal borders by witnessing to the truth and
spreading the light of that truth to the nations throughout the world.

One final text from the Dead Sea Scrolls is particularly noteworthy
(4Q418, frag. 81 = 4Q423 8 + 24?). God is said to be 'your portion and
your inheritance among the sons of Adam, \[and over\] his
\[in\]heritance he has given them authority' (line 3). Thus, the members
of the Qumran community are those who are the true 'sons of Adam' whom
God has given authority over an 'inheritance'. Those who 'inherit the
earth' will 'walk' in an 'eter\[nal\] plantation' (lines 13--14), likely
referring to the whole earth as a large
Eden.[70](#appen11.html#NFIN286){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN286-1 .apnf} They
'shall fill \[apparently the earth\] and . . . and be satiated with the
abundance of good' (line 19). So far, the description of the community
echoes the commission of Genesis 1:26, 28. They are also to 'honour' God
'by consecrating yourself to him, in accordance to the fact that he has
placed you as a holy of holies \[over
all\][71](#appen11.html#NFIN287){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN287-1 .apnf} the
earth, and over all the angels . . .' (line
4).[72](#appen11.html#NFIN288){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN288-1 .apnf}
Strikingly, the community is seen to be the eschatological 'holy of
holies' extending over all the earth! As such, they are 'sons of Adam',
finally doing what he should have done in his primeval garden sanctuary.
Just as we have seen []{#chap4.html#page_158}earlier that the commission
of Genesis 1:26--28 was to have begun in the garden sanctuary of Genesis
2,[73](#appen11.html#NFIN289){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN289-1 .apnf} so this
Qumran passage reflects the same kind of linkage between the first two
chapters of Genesis.

This last passage from Qumran is amazing, since as we saw in our
introductory chapter, and will again in the conclusion to the book, John
pictures the new creation in Revelation 21 to be one enormous holy of
holies. As a worldwide holy of holies, God 'has multiplied your glory
exceedingly' (line 5a). Thus, the divine glory is no longer cordoned off
in a back room in Israel's physical temple but extends into the world
through his end-time image bearers. God 'has placed' them 'for him as a
first-born' (line 5b), another reference to them as the true communal
Adam who are extending out and reflecting his glory because they reflect
his image (line 5b). They are priest-kings who carry out the
eschatological purpose that we have seen to be inherent in Genesis 1 --
2.

Though it may appear out of place here in a section on Judaism, we must
mention *Odes of Solomon* 11 -- 12, an early Jewish-Christian writing
(c. [AD]{.small} 100), because it has more unique similarities to the
preceding Qumran descriptions than any other extant work of the time:

::: stroplg

:::

This passage combines themes seen in Qumran with some earlier ideas that
we have seen are associated with the Eden sanctuary: (1) repeated
descriptions of the Garden of Eden, especially its growing trees, as
well as mention of the garden's expansiveness (11:23); (2) people are
established in the garden on 'a rock' (11:5); (3) the image of the
tabernacle (12:2) and notions of witnessing (12:1--2); (4) those in the
garden are exposed to divine light (11:13, 19); (5) those in the garden
labour in it, which is interpreted as 'good works' (11:20--22); (6)
people receive 'rest' in the garden (11:12) and (7) benefit from
life-giving waters. The 'paradise' has expanded and 'there is much room'
in it (11:23) because it contains a multitude of believers, who
throughout this passage are said to be part of the garden (11:18--23).

Another passage from chapter 38 of the *Odes* is similar:

::: stroplg
^38:16^But I have been made wise so as not to fall into the hands of the
deceivers,

and I myself rejoiced because the Truth had gone with me.

^17^For I was established and . . . my foundations were laid on account
of the Lord's hand;

[]{#chap4.html#page_160}because he has planted me.

^18^For he set the root, and watered it and . . . blessed it,

and its fruits will be forever.

^19^ It penetrated deeply and sprang up and spread out,

and it was full and was enlarged.

^20^ And the Lord alone was praised,

in his planting and in his cultivation . . .
:::

This text also combines temple-building language together with that of
expanding garden imagery. The speaker says that he was not deceived but
remained in the truth *because* God had established him as a
well-planted garden. This is very comparable to the Qumran *Hymn Scroll*
(1QH 6.15--17), which we saw above combined the same images of temple,
expanding garden, and truth.

### Sirach (second century BC) {.int_niv2}

An intriguing passage from *Sirach* 24 contains imagery much like the
Qumran *Hymn Scroll*. Just as the preceding discussion revealed that
Qumran was primarily dependent on Genesis 2 for its depictions, so also
the preceding *Sirach* passage may be based partly on Numbers 24:5--7,
which, as we saw at the commencement of this chapter, has a similar
though more abbreviated portrayal of an expanding garden. The *Sirach*
text personifies 'wisdom' as 'set over the created order' and as the
model for true humanity, 'corresponding to the place intended for
Adam'.[74](#appen11.html#NFIN290){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN290-1 .apnf} Adam
should have possessed this wisdom to be a wise ruler, but he did not.
*Sirach* 24:28 says, 'the first man knew her \[wisdom\] not perfectly'.
What is startling about this for our purposes is that 'wisdom's' role is
explained primarily through the language of the temple and the Garden of
Eden. 'Wisdom' is first portrayed as 'seeking rest' somewhere on the
created earth (24:7), and

::: cita
^8^so the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made
me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob,
and thine inheritance in Israel . . .

^10^In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established
in Zion.

^11^Likewise, in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was
my power.

[]{#chap4.html#page_161}^12^and I took root in an honorable people, even
in the portion of the Lord's inheritance.

^13^I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon
the mountains of Hermon.

^14^I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore, and as a rose plant
in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a plain, and grew up as a plane
tree.

^15^I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a
pleasant odor like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet
storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.

^16^As the turpentine trees I stretched out my branches, and my branches
are the branches of glory and grace.

^17^As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour and my flowers are the
fruit of glory and riches . . . ^19^Come unto me all you that are
desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits . . .

^23^All these things are the book of the covenant of the most high God,
even the law which Moses commanded . . .

^25^He \[God\] fills all things with his wisdom, as Pishon, and as
Tigris in the time of the new fruits.

^26^He makes the understanding abound like the Euphrates, and as Jordan
in the time of the harvest. ^27^He makes the doctrine of knowledge
appear as the light, as Gihon in the time of vintage.

^28^The first man knew her \[wisdom\] not perfectly . . . ^30^I
\[wisdom\] also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into
a garden.

^31^I said, I will water my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a
river, and my river became a sea. ^32^I will yet make instruction to
shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off. ^33^I will
yet pour out teaching as prophecy and leave it to all ages forever.

^34^Behold that I have not labored for myself only, but for all them
that seek wisdom.
:::

This is either an idealization of what divine 'wisdom' should have done
in Israel or, more probably, it is an assertion of the task 'wisdom' was
conceived of performing in Israel but had not yet completed. The
approximate first half of the passage (24:7--19) portrays 'wisdom' as
dwelling in the temple and as itself being fertile and garden-like
(compared to trees and vines and their fruits). The
[]{#chap4.html#page_162}combination of these two images is natural in
the light of our earlier assessment that Genesis 2 has in view Eden as a
garden sanctuary. In particular, Numbers 24:5--7, itself possibly a
development of Eden, appears to be part of the inspiration for
*Sirach*'s imagery:

::: stroplg
^5^How fair are your *tents*, O Jacob,

Your *dwellings*, O Israel!

^6^Like palm trees that stretch out,

Like gardens beside the river,

Like aloes planted by the Lord,

Like cedars beside the waters.

^7^Water shall flow from his buckets,

And his seed shall be by many waters,

And his king shall be higher than Agag,

And his kingdom shall be exalted.
:::

As we saw earlier, the Numbers passage is quite suggestive of an
expanding tabernacle-like garden, and was interpreted to be a reference
to Israel's tabernacle by the Greek Old Testament, the Aramaic Bible,
and by the author of Hebrews. Strikingly, the *Sirach* passage
(24:8--17), like the Greek and Aramaic Old Testament renderings, also
understand the garden imagery of Numbers 24:6 (growing 'palm trees' and
'cedars' and other garden descriptions) to be part of tabernacle and
temple portrayals. In fact, just as in Numbers 24:5--6, *Sirach*
24:8--17 first explicitly mentions the 'tabernacle' and 'dwelling'
(though in the singular) followed by the garden language, as well as by
descriptions of abundant waters (cf. Num. 24:6--7 with *Sirach*
24:25--31).

The second half of the passage (24:25--32) explicitly equates 'wisdom'
to God's Law and likens her to water as the source of fertility and
concludes by comparing her to 'light'. The point is that 'wisdom' was to
be the source of Israel's faithful obedience to God that would bear
spiritual fruit (e.g., 'glory and grace', 'understanding', and
'knowledge'), which would not only fill the land of Israel but the
entire earth.

Accordingly, the goal is that God 'fill all things with his wisdom'
(24:25). Just as water came from Eden to water the garden and then
branched out into the four rivers and watered the earth, so 'wisdom' is
like that water: the earth is not merely to be filled with all kinds of
material fecundity but spiritual fruitfulness. It is well known that
physical fruitfulness often symbolizes spiritual faithfulness by God's
[]{#chap4.html#page_163}people, Israel's experience in the land being
the prime example. This connection is probably also the case here. This
portrayal, especially the description of 'wisdom' as a 'brook . . . as a
conduit into a garden', likely is based on our earlier observation that
the water source in Eden was identified with the very presence of God
dwelling in an arboreal inner sanctum and extending out to the adjoining
gardenlike 'holy place'. This description now applies to the temple in
Jerusalem.

Furthermore, the description of 'wisdom' 'filling all things' and
growing from a 'brook' into a 'river' and becoming a 'sea' is an image
of 'wisdom' expanding to fill the entire earth, and may itself be an
allusion to Habakkuk 2:14: 'For the earth will be filled with the
knowledge of the glory of the L[ORD]{.small}, as the waters cover the
sea'[75](#appen11.html#NFIN291){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN291-1 .apnf} (on
which see further below).

The pictorial expansion of the Edenic brook of wisdom into a sea
coalesces well with our earlier conclusion that Adam's original task was
to enlarge the borders of the garden sanctuary until they included the
whole earth. Then God's presence would permeate the earth as never
before. The conclusion of the *Sirach* passage interprets the picture of
worldwide deluge as 'wisdom' 'making instruction shine as the morning',
'sending forth her light afar off', and 'pouring out teaching . . . to
all ages forever'. The goal is that divine wisdom in Israel's temple
should fill the whole earth, a goal not 'yet' achieved (note 'yet'
\[*̒etî* \] introducing each of the statements in 24:32 and 24:33).

Significantly, the last line of the passage shows that 'wisdom', as it
should have done through Adam, now is to spread out by means of humans
'that seek wisdom' (24:34). In such people 'wisdom' will 'take root'
(24:12), will 'stretch out her branches . . . of glory' (24:16) and
'send forth her light afar off' (24:32). 'They that work by me
\['wisdom'\] will not sin' (24:22) but shine divine light into every
nook and cranny of the creation until it becomes a holy auditorium
filled with God's tabernacling being.

It is again appropriate to look ahead to the early Jewish-Christian work
of the *Odes of Solomon* (ch. 6) for a remarkably similar portrayal to
part of *Sirach*'s description of 'understanding' and 'wisdom'
proceeding out from the temple and progressing from a brook to a river
(24:30--31; cf. 24:25--27).

::: stroplg

^12^For from the Most High the drink was

:::

The *Odes* passage may even be an allusion to *Sirach*. The picture
differs only in that the water flows out to the earth and back to the
temple again, apparently indicating that God's knowledge conquered
people on the earth and brought them into relation to his temple.

*1 Enoch* 90:28--36 envisions Israel's old temple 'folded up,
dismantled, and carried off', only to be replaced by a new house
'greater and loftier than that first' and all redeemed humanity
'assembled in that house' because it was 'large and broad and very
full'. This may imply that the extent of this temple structure is
worldwide,[77](#appen11.html#NFIN293){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN293-1 .apnf}

### Philo (first century AD) {.int_niv2}

The evidence of Philo with respect to the theme of temple expansion is
certainly not explicit, but he does assert that the temple rituals have
an efficacious effect for the whole world, which may point further to
the universal end-time significance of the temple. Philo says that the
offering at the altar of the first-fruit from the land of Israel serves
an efficacious purpose 'both to the nation . . . and for the whole human
race . . . The reason for this is that the Jewish nation is to the whole
inhabited world what the priest is to the State' (*Spec. Leg*.
2.162--163). This may be an implicit corroboration also that what the
temple was to Israel, Israel was to be to the whole world. For Philo the
cosmic []{#chap4.html#page_165}symbolism of the priest's vesture means
that the priest not only prays for Israel but also 'on behalf of the
whole human race' and 'for the parts of nature, earth, water, air,
fire'. The ultimate purpose of these prayers is to petition God 'to make
His creature a partaker of His own kindly and merciful
nature'.[78](#appen11.html#NFIN294){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN294-1 .apnf}

### The *Sibylline Oracles* (c. AD 100) {.int_niv2}

*Sibylline Oracles* 5:414--432 portrays a mammoth temple not unlike some
of the others encountered in the preceding Jewish texts:

::: cita
For there has come from the plains of heaven a blessed man with the
sceptre in his hand which God has committed to his clasp: and he has won
fair dominion over all . . . and the city \[Jerusalem\] . . . he set . .

fair sanctuary, and fashioned it in size of many
furlongs,[79](#appen11.html#NFIN295){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN295-1 .apnf}
with a giant tower touching the very clouds and seen of all, so that all
the faithful and all the righteous may see the glory of the invisible
God . . . It is the last time of the saints when God accomplishes these
things . . . God \[is\] . . . the Creator of the great
temple.[80](#appen11.html#NFIN296){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN296-1 .apnf}
:::

As in the case of *1 Enoch* 90, again we have a huge latter-day temple
that is, at least, many miles in diameter, and it is so high that all
the righteous inhabitants of the world can see its tower. Not
unexpectedly, we also detect an echo of the Genesis 1:26--28 commission
in direct connection with the building of the temple: a 'man' who is
'blessed' gains 'dominion over all' (cf. Dan. 7:13--14). We found the
same connection between the Adamic commission and the garden sanctuary
in Genesis 2 and the same link in the case of the patriarchs, pre-exilic
Israel and post-exilic, latter-day Israel. The commission to rule and
subdue typically involves building a temple and expanding its
boundaries. The base of the temple in the Oracle is so many miles in
diameter and its tower so high that all saints throughout the world are
able to see it.

will be removed for the sake of the world at the end of history.

## Concluding thoughts on the Old Testament and Jewish views about an expanding garden or temple {.int_niv1}

The thesis of the all-consuming nature of the latter-day temple is
consistent with Numbers 14:21 ('indeed, as I live, all the earth will be
filled with the glory of the L[ORD]{.small}') and Habakkuk 2:14 ('For
the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the
L[ORD]{.small}, as the waters cover the sea' = Is. 11:9). Since the
temple was the symbolic repository of the Law, the epitome of Israel's
wisdom, its universal extension would entail the permeation of the
cosmos with divine wisdom and knowledge in line with *Sirach*, which was
discussed towards the conclusion of this chapter.

The various builders and planners of Israel's temples may have expressed
some awareness of the need for an expanding temple on Mount Zion, since
each successive temple became bigger and bigger, particularly with
respect to their outer court area: tabernacle [→]{.mev4} Solomon's
temple[81](#appen11.html#NFIN297){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN297-1 .apnf}
[→]{.mev4} second temple and its expansions of an additional outer
'court of the women' and a further outer 'court of the
Gentiles'[82](#appen11.html#NFIN298){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN298-1 .apnf}
[→]{.mev4} the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 temple (containing an inner and outer
court)[83](#appen11.html#NFIN299){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN299-1 .apnf} = the
temple of the Qumran *Temple Scroll*, which had
[]{#chap4.html#page_167}an inner court and an outer court; both the
latter two temples encompassed the whole populated area of
Jerusalem.[84](#appen11.html#NFIN300){#chap4.html#ap_NFIN300-1 .apnf}
Such expanding building projects may point to an instinct based on the
original intention that Eden's garden-temple was to expand, an intuition
we have seen that appears to have motivated the Pharaohs to engage in
similar temple-projects.

::: dev
::: {#chap5.html#niv1-016 .niv1}
## Introduction {.int_niv1}

The New Testament pictures Christ and the church as finally having done
what Adam, Noah, and Israel had failed to do in extending the temple of
God's presence throughout the world. Luke 2:32 and Acts 26:23 picture
Christ as fulfilling this commission to be a 'light' to the end of the
earth (an allusion to the Servant Israel's commission in Is. 49:6). This
is why Matthew 28:18 portrays Jesus as the Son of Man saying, 'All
authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.' This is an
allusion to the prophecy of Daniel 7:13--14, where it is said of the
'Son of Man', 'authority was given to him, and all the nations of the
earth . . . \[were\] serving him' (so [LXX]{.small}\]). On the basis of
this authority, Jesus then gives the well-known commission 'therefore,
as you go, disciple all the nations, baptizing them . . . teaching them
to keep all things whichsoever I commanded you; and, behold, *I am with
you* all the days until the end of the age'. Notice that Christ uses the
same accompaniment formula as God used with the commissioning of his
people in the Old Testament to subdue and rule over the earth. His
presence will enable them to fulfil 'the great commission' to rule over
and fill the earth with God's presence, which Adam, Noah and Israel had
failed to carry out.

In this respect, as we will see more clearly in the following section of
this chapter, Jesus is a Last Adam figure, and this is partly why he
implicitly identifies himself with Daniel's 'Son of Man' in issuing the
universal commission to his followers: he is the 'son of Adam', the
equivalent to Daniel's 'Son of Man', finally accomplishing what the
first Adam should have and what Daniel predicts the messianic end-time
Adam would do.

[]{#chap5.html#page_170}The Edenic imagery describing the city-temple in
Revelation 22:1--3 also reflects an intention to show that the building
of the temple that began in Genesis 2 but was abandoned will be
commenced again and completed in Christ and his people, and will
encompass the whole new creation. The cosmic reflection of the broad
tripartite structure of the temple implicitly suggested that its purpose
was to point to a future time when it would engulf the whole world.
Accordingly, Israel's temple functioned much like an architect's model
of a newly planned building. It was but a small replica of what was to
be built on a much larger scale. Ideally, when the Israelites looked at
and thought of their temple they were not to think of it as an end in
itself, only a sign of their election as a nation. Rather, they were to
be reminded of the great goal of spreading the light of God's presence
throughout the earth until the entire world was under God's tabernacling
presence. Since the Old Testament temple was the localized dwelling of
God's special revelatory presence on earth, the temple's symbolic
correspondence with the cosmos pointed to an eschatological goal of
God's presence tabernacling throughout the earth, an eschatological goal
which Revelation 21:1 -- 22:5 appears to be developing (cf. Rev. 21:3).

Few have come close to elaborating the redemptive-historical
significance of the temple's expanding cosmic symbolism either in the
Old or New Testament in the manner this book has attempted to so
far.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN301){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN301-1 .apnf} We are
now in a position to ask: why is the description of Christ as a 'temple'
particularly apt? How does this description relate to the Old Testament
background of the temple as symbolic of creation or like a sacred
organic structure growing to fill creation? The answer, in brief, is
that the New Testament refers to Christ appropriately as a temple
because he was the beginning of the new creation. His resurrection was
the first, great act of new creation, as testified to explicitly by
Paul: 'he died and rose again . . . so that if anyone is in Christ, that
one is a new creation . . . (2 Cor. 5:15, 17; so likewise Gal. 6:15--16;
[]{#chap5.html#page_171}Col. 1:18; Rev. 3:14, though the concept occurs
throughout the New Testament). This is the best explanation, for
example, of why the Gospels repeatedly refer to Christ as 'destroying
the \[old\] temple, and in three days raising it up' (Matt. 26:61;
27:40; Mark 14:58; 15:29; John 2:20--21; cf. Acts 6:14). As we will see,
Jesus' followers carry the same description of the 'temple of God'
because they are corporately represented by the resurrected Lord of the
new creation.

The majority of the remainder of this book will survey those parts of
the New Testament that portray Christ and his people either composing
the beginning form of God's end-time temple or being a part of its
consummate fulfilment. We will also try to see how the themes of Eden,
Adam's commission and Israel's temple observed in the preceding chapters
shed further light on the New Testament conception of the temple,
especially with respect to its expanding nature.

## Jesus as the Last Adam and the temple of the new creation in the Synoptic Gospels {.int_niv1}

::: {#chap5.html#niv2-056 .niv2}
### Jesus as the Last Adam and inaugurator of a new creation {.int_niv2}

The Gospels portray Jesus as an Adam figure who is inaugurating a new
creation. Matthew's genealogy begins with the Greek expression *biblos
geneseōs*, which can be translated the 'book of the genealogy' or the
'book of beginning' or even the 'book of genesis'. This appears to be an
allusion to Genesis 2:4 which also has *biblos geneseōs*: 'This is the
book of the generation (or 'genesis') of heaven and earth, when they
came about, in the day in which the Lord God made the heaven and the
earth.' Likewise, Genesis 5:1--2 has, 'This is the book of the
generation (*biblos geneseōs*; some render it 'genealogy') of man
\[Adam\] in the day in which God made Adam, according to the image of
God He made him. Male and female He made them, and blessed them; and He
called his name Adam in the day in which He made them.' Then, just as in
Matthew 1, there follows a genealogy (the first in the Bible), beginning
with Adam and ending with Noah. That Matthew is, indeed, alluding to
Genesis 2 and 5 is enhanced by observing that these are the only two
places in the entire Greek Old Testament where the phrase *biblos
geneseōs* occurs. Matthew's point in using this phrase is to make clear
that he is narrating the record of the new age, the new creation,
launched by the coming, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Perhaps, also mention of the Holy Spirit in conceiving Jesus
[]{#chap5.html#page_172}(1:18--20) points further to him as the
beginning of the new creation, just as the Spirit was mentioned in
Genesis 1:2 as forming the first creation. Matthew 1:18, 20 says, 'now
the generation (the genesis) of Jesus Christ was in this manner . . .
that which is begotten (*gennēthen*) in her is from the Holy Spirit'.

Instead of beginning with David and Abraham and working down towards the
time of Jesus like Matthew, Luke's genealogy begins with the time of
Jesus and works back to Adam, with which it ends: 'the son of Adam, the
son of God' (Luke 3:38). The purpose is to identify Jesus as the Last
Adam (Glickman 1980: 55--58). For his part, Mark's Gospel begins with
'the beginning (*archē*) of the Gospel of Jesus Christ' (cf. *en archē*,
Gen. 1:1).

The 'forty days and forty nights' of Jesus' temptation in the wilderness
echo Israel's forty years in the wilderness. Jesus, as true Israel, is
the micro-Israel who has replaced the macro-national Israel. Hence,
years are reduced figuratively down to days. Each response by Jesus to
Satan is taken from a response by Moses to Israel's failure in the
wilderness (Deut. 8:3 in Matt. 4:4; Deut. 6:16 in Matt. 4:7; Deut. 6:13
in Matt. 4:10). Jesus succeeds in facing the same temptations to which
Israel succumbed.

The reason, however, that Luke's genealogy ends with 'Adam the son of
God' (Luke 3:38) is to identify Jesus as an end-time Adam, the true Son
of God, resisting the temptations to which Adam and Eve succumbed. That
Eden's temptations are in mind is apparent from Mark's comments that
after Jesus successfully endured the temptations in the wilderness, 'he
was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to him' (which
shows that he, in fact, was the promised one of Ps. 91:11--12, and
compare 91:13).

The defeat of the devil in the wilderness may also be viewed secondarily
to be Jesus' first act of conquering the latter-day 'Canaanites in the
promised land' as true Israel. One might question whether or not this
idea is present in the temptation account, since the major theme, as we
noted above, is that of Jesus resisting temptations to sin to which
Israel surrendered. The theme of temptation is certainly highlighted by
noticing that each of the three Old Testament citations from Deuteronomy
refers to the manner that Israel should have responded to their
temptations but did not. Closer inspection of each of the Deuteronomy
contexts, however, reveals the goal of what would happen if Israel did
respond faithfully to their temptations: they would 'go in and possess
the good land which the L[ORD]{.small} swore' to give 'by driving out
all your enemies from before you' (Deut.
[]{#chap5.html#page_173}6:18--19).[2](#appen11.html#NFIN302){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN302-1
.apnf} Plausibly, Jesus may well have had in mind this common purpose of
each of the three contexts.

Consequently, Jesus' victory over temptation appears to have prepared
him to conquer the one who was the ultimate satanic prince of the
Canaanites and of all wicked
nations[3](#appen11.html#NFIN303){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN303-1 .apnf} and to
conquer the land in a way that Israel had not been able to. His very
resistance to these satanic allurements was the very beginning of his
defeat of the devil. Jesus' ministry of casting out demons continues
this holy warfare of the true Israel, Jesus. Christ's casting out of
demons was an expression of his beginning, though decisive, defeat of
Satan, who had brought creation into captivity through his deception of
Adam and Eve. This is the significance of the parable of the binding of
the strong man (Matt. 12:29). By casting out the devil and his forces,
Jesus was accomplishing the latter-day defeat of Satan that Adam should
have accomplished in the first
garden.[4](#appen11.html#NFIN304){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN304-1 .apnf} The
devil tries to tempt Christ by quoting Scripture, 'If you are the Son of
God throw Yourself down \[from the pinnacle of the temple\]; for it is
written, "He will give His angels charge concerning You"; and "On their
hands they will bear You up, Lest You strike Your foot against a stone"'
(Matt. 4:6). This is a quotation of Psalm 91:11--12. Psalm 91:13,
however, goes on to say that the righteous man cared for by the angels
'will tread upon the lion and the cobra, the young lion and the serpent
you will trample down'. Psalm 91:13 may allude to the great Genesis 3:15
promise 'He shall bruise you on the head, and you shall bruise
[]{#chap5.html#page_174}him on the heel.' Christ's refusal to follow
Satan's advice during the wilderness temptations was the beginning
victory over Satan prophesied in the psalm. Matthew likely intends that
the reader be aware of this broader context of the psalm, to some degree
at least, which together with the three Deuteronomy contexts above,
further reveals the theme of Jesus' victory over opposition.

After defeating the devil in the promised land, Jesus again is seen as
beginning to fulfil Isaiah's promises of Israel's restoration (Matt.
4:12--16). Consequently, in 4:18--22 Jesus begins to regather the tribes
of Israel by beginning to call his twelve apostles. The twelve represent
the microcosmic true Israel under their leader Jesus (i.e., Yahweh),
though Jesus is also portrayed as a latter-day Moses (Allison 1993).
This restoration involves various kinds of healings, which were
prophesied to occur when Israel would undergo her true end-time
restoration to God (Matt. 4:23--25; 11:4--6; Is. 32:3--4; 35:5--6; 42:7,
16).

Such healings also represented the restoration of creation from the
fallen condition of the world. The physical (and spiritual) curses of
the fall are beginning to be removed by Jesus, as he is re-establishing
the new creation and kingdom, which Adam should have established. Seen
within the framework of the new creation, Christ's miracles of healing
not only inaugurated the end-time kingdom but signalled the beginning of
the new creation, since the healings were a beginning reversal of the
curse of the old fallen world. The miracles were a sign of the
inbreaking new creation, where people would be completely healed. Those
he healed, and especially raised from the dead, foreshadowed his own
resurrection. Christ's resurrection was the first-fruits of all
believers. They, like him, would be raised with perfected, restored
bodies at the very end of the age, when the new world would be ushered
in. The repeated and dominating notion of the kingdom in the Gospels is
one of the main ways by which the Evangelists express ideas about the
new creation which is consistent with the inextricable link between the
kingship of Adam and new creation in Genesis 1 -- 2.

The reason that Jesus reflects both the Old Testament figures of Adam
and Israel is because, as we have seen earlier, Israel and her
patriarchs were given the same commission as was Adam in Genesis
1:26--28. Consequently, it is not an overstatement to understand Israel
as a corporate Adam who had failed in their 'Garden of
Eden',[5](#appen11.html#NFIN305){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN305-1 .apnf} in much
the same way as their primal father had failed in the first
[]{#chap5.html#page_175}garden. For these reasons, it is understandable
that Jesus is called 'Son of God' partly because that was a name for the
first Adam (Luke 3:38; cf. Gen. 5:1--3) and for Israel (Exod. 4:22; Hos.
11:1). Likewise, the expression 'son of man' from Daniel 7:13 refers to
end-time Israel and her representative king as the son of Adam who is
sovereign over beasts (recall that the 'son of man' takes over the
kingdoms of former evil empires portrayed as beasts). Understandably,
against this background, it is natural that 'Son of Man' became one of
Jesus' favourite ways of referring to himself.

The resurrection of Jesus is a further development of the new creation
(e.g., Matt. 27:57 -- 28:15). Resurrection is a full-blown new creation
notion, since the way the righteous were to enter in and become a part
of the new heavens and earth is through God recreating their bodies.
Jesus' claim that 'all authority has been given to Me in heaven and on
earth' (Matt. 28:18) alludes to Daniel 7:13--14, which prophesied that
the 'son of man' would be 'given authority, glory and sovereignty' for
ever.[6](#appen11.html#NFIN306){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN306-1 .apnf} Then, as
we noted at the introduction of this chapter, he immediately gives the
disciples the so-called 'Great Commission': 'Go therefore and make
disciples of all the nations . . . teaching them . . . and lo, I am with
you always' (Matt. 28:19--20). This edict not only continues the
allusion to the Daniel 7 prophecy (v. 14, 'that all the peoples,
nations, and men of every language might serve him'), but is itself a
renewal of the Genesis 1:26--28 commission to Adam.

As we also observed earlier, even the divine accompaniment formula ('I
am with you') occurs in Matthew 28:20 to indicate how the disciples will
be empowered to carry out the commission, just as we saw in the later
applications of Adam's commission to the patriarchs and Israel. In fact,
the reference to 'all the nations' (*panta ta ethnē*) is an echo of
Genesis 22:18 (likewise, Gen. 18:18), which, as we have seen, is one of
the inchoate sanctuary-building narratives. The reminiscence of the
Abrahamic promise returns to the theme found in the first verse of
Matthew's Gospel (1:1): 'that the blessings promised to Abraham and
through him to all peoples of the earth (Gen. 12:3) are now to be
fulfilled in Jesus the
Messiah'.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN307){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN307-1 .apnf}

Thus, Christ is the Son of Adam, or 'the Son of Man', who has begun to
do what the first Adam should have done and to inherit what the first
Adam should have, including the glory reflected in God's image. That
Jesus' baptism was part of his work 'to fulfil all righteousness' (Matt.
[]{#chap5.html#page_176}3:13--17) likely alludes to the fact that he was
coming to set right what Israel and Adam had done wrong; he was coming
to obey successfully in contrast to Israel's former disobedience.

### Jesus as the new temple {.int_niv2}

Part of Jesus' doing what Adam should have done included establishing
the new temple and extending it obediently. In reality, he himself was
that temple because he was the beginning of the new creation, especially
in his resurrection. To call Christ the 'temple' is merely another way
of referring to him as the new creation, since the temple was symbolic
of creation (which we took great pains to demonstrate in ch. 2)!

We have seen in our discussion of Genesis that Adam's commission in
Genesis 1 was to be carried out by his serving in the Edenic temple,
managing it in an orderly manner, and expanding its boundaries. In fact,
we have seen that the reapplication of Adam's commission to Noah, the
patriarchs, Israel and end-time Israel also was inextricably linked to
the beginning of building temples and expanding them. Therefore, it
should be no surprise that Christ also initiates the building of a new
temple, once again performing the duties that the first Adam and Israel
failed in executing. At various points in the Gospels, Christ indicates
that the old temple is becoming obsolete and that he is replacing it
with a new one.

The first place to start is to pick up on our preceding discussion of
Matthew 28, with which we concluded the last section. In addition to
Daniel 7:13--14, Jesus' 'Great Commission' to his disciples appears also
to allude to 2 Chronicles 36:23: 'Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, "The
L[ORD]{.small}, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the
earth, and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which
is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all His people, may the
L[ORD]{.small} his God be with him, and let him go up!"' This passage
has three things in common with Matthew 28:18--20: (1) both Cyrus and
Jesus assert authority over all the earth; (2) the commission to 'go';
and (3) the assurance of the divine presence to fulfil the commission.
Jesus' commission, however, escalates that of Cyrus's in that Jesus'
also has authority over 'heaven' as well as 'earth', and he speaks of
his own presence going with the people being addressed. In addition,
Jesus' commission is not aimed at old Jerusalem but 'nations' throughout
the whole earth. Furthermore, if the temple construction of 2 Chronicles
is in mind, then this is an implicit commission for the disciples to
fulfil the Genesis 1:26--28 []{#chap5.html#page_177}mandate by
rebuilding the new temple, composed of worshippers throughout the earth.

Three further observations point to an allusion to 2 Chronicles in
Matthew 28. First, 2 Chronicles in the Hebrew canon of Scripture was the
last book of the Old Testament. Accordingly, 2 Chronicles 36:23 becomes
the last verse of the entire Old Testament, which now ends with the
commission to rebuild the temple, so that it serves as a nice canonical
transition to an even more escalated commission to build the temple in
Matthew's Gospel. Second, Matthew's Gospel portrays Jesus' genealogy
partly on the basis of that in 1 Chronicles 1 -- 3. Third, Isaiah refers
to Cyrus as a 'messiah' (Is. 44:28 -- 45:1) because he had the task of
enabling Israel to rebuild her temple.

With these facts in mind and recalling that Jesus' reference to 'all the
nations' in Matthew 28:19 harks back to Matthew 1:1, it is attractive to
suggest that, like 1 and 2 Chronicles, Matthew constructs his Gospel
partly to reflect the beginning and ending of Chronicles but applies the
goal of the genealogy to Jesus. Thus, the concluding commission is not
spoken by a pagan king to theocratic Israel but spoken by the true,
divine king Jesus to the beginning remnant of true Israel, 'the Twelve'.
In this respect, the 2 Chronicles passage would be viewed as a
historical event to commission a temple that foreshadowed typologically
the much greater event of Jesus' 'Great Commission' to build a greater
temple.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN308){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN308-1 .apnf}

In addition to the temple-building implicit in the Great Commission,
Jesus' various statements that he can forgive sin could also suggest
that he is beginning to replace the temple (Luke 7:49--50). Jesus'
Jewish audience recognized that his claim to forgive sin also was a
unique divine prerogative, and they accused him of blasphemy (Matt.
9:3), which underscores that the major point of this passage is the
divine function of Jesus in forgiving sin. Perhaps also echoes of the
function of the temple are implicit in this narrative. The temple was
the divinely instituted place where sacrifices were offered for the
forgiveness of sins, but now Jesus has become the divinely instituted
location where forgiveness is to be found, since he himself is also the
sin offering. Matthew 9:2--6 (= Mark 2:1--12; Luke 5:18--26) says that
'the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins', which may
[]{#chap5.html#page_178}suggest that his pardoning of sins, formerly
obtained at the temple, is part of his work as the priestly last Adam.
Hence, again, we have the close association of a temple function (albeit
echoed) with the Adamic commission to have authority over the
earth.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN309){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN309-1 .apnf}
Consequently, Jesus could send out his disciples to announce this new
basis of forgiveness (Matt. 16:19; John 20:23).

Jesus' self-identification with the temple is underscored in Matthew
12:6, where he says about himself, 'something greater than the temple is
here'. Jesus 'is greater than Jonah' as a prophet and his deliverance
will be greater because he will *actually* die for three days and rise
(Matt. 12:39--41). Jesus is 'greater than Solomon' because he is a
greater king and has more wisdom (Matt. 12:42). Similarly, Jesus is
greater than the temple now because 'God's presence is more manifest in
Him than in the Temple. On him, not on the Temple, rests the "Shekinah"
glory' (Cole 1950:12) in an even greater way than previously in the
temple (echoing perhaps the prophecy in Hag. 2:9, 'the latter glory of
this house will be greater than the former'). Therefore, not only is
Jesus identified with the temple because he is assuming the role of the
sacrificial system, but he is also now, instead of the temple, the
unique place on earth where God's revelatory presence is located. God is
manifesting his glorious presence in Jesus in a greater way than it was
ever manifested in a physical temple structure.

This statement about Jesus' superiority over the temple occurs in a
context where he is offering eschatological Sabbath rest to people
(Matt. 11:28--30) (Laansma 1997: 159--251) which was forfeited by Adam
and his fallen progeny. In fact, Matthew 12:7 quotes from Hosea 6:6 ('I
desire compassion and not a sacrifice'), and the very next statement in
Hosea says, 'But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant' (Hos.
6:7).[10](#appen11.html#NFIN310){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN310-1 .apnf} Thus,
it may not be coincidental that Christ alludes to this context in Hosea,
nor that he refers to himself as 'the Son of Man \[Adam\]' who 'is Lord
of the Sabbath' only two verses after comparing himself to the temple
(Matt. 12:8). We have seen that the temple was the place where God was
to 'rest', after he had given Israel 'rest' from her
enemies.[11](#appen11.html#NFIN311){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN311-1 .apnf} What
we have then in Matthew 11:28 -- 12:8 is the confluence of notions
concerning eschatological rest, Adam and the Son of Adam, and the
temple, which []{#chap5.html#page_179}should not be surprising given the
association of Christ elsewhere with Adamic and temple themes.

Jesus' so-called 'cleansing' of the temple may also point to his task of
replacing the old temple with a new one (Matt. 21:12--13 and
parallels).[12](#appen11.html#NFIN312){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN312-1 .apnf}
The Jews had made the temple into an economic enterprise instead of a
place of worship. Christ's radical act in the temple was a parable of
judgment against the temple, not only because of its misuse, but because
it represented Israel's rejection of God's word and commandments and
ultimately of Jesus himself (so N. T. Wright 1996: 413--427). Jesus
quotes Isaiah 56:7 ('My house will be called a house of prayer'), which
is a prophecy that the temple would become a 'rallying place' and
location of prayer for the Gentiles in the latter days (see Is.
56:3--8). Jesus' point is that the temple must be replaced because it
'was not fulfilling its God-ordained role as witness to the nations but
had become, like the first temple, the premier symbol of a superstitious
belief that God would protect and rally his people irrespective of their
conformity to his will' (Carson 1995:
442).[13](#appen11.html#NFIN313){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN313-1 .apnf} The
second temple had failed to achieve the end-time purpose for which it
had been designed (see further, S. M. Bryan 2002: 199--225).

Though not mentioned in this passage, Jesus' violent act in the temple
would briefly have stopped the offering of sacrifices by shutting down
the procedure by which animals were bought and sacrificed. If the
temporary ceasing of sacrifices is to be inferred to any degree from the
passage, then in performing this action, Jesus would have been
indicating that the temple's purpose in offering sacrifices for
forgiveness was passing away and that the temple was awaiting
judgment.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN314){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN314-1 .apnf}
Directly after this episode, those who were forbidden to enter the
temple because of their deformity were now accepted by Jesus: the 'blind
and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them' (21:14).
This suggests further that he is beginning to clear the way for the
eschatological temple, since the Old Testament prophesied that in the
future sanctuary eunuchs and other outcasts could worship even together
with Gentiles. That which was formerly unclean will be considered clean
for worship in the true temple (Is. 56:3--8).

The healing in the temple is yet another reflection of Jesus taking
[]{#chap5.html#page_180}over the true role of the temple, since we have
seen that his healings demonstrated that he could heal spiritual disease
through offering forgiveness himself (e.g., the lame man in Mark
2:1--12) and that he had become the source of forgiveness instead of
Israel's temple. His death and resurrection is the climax of this role
of temple-building: 'he builds the new temple by fulfilling the function
of the temple eschatologically, i.e., by offering his life for all as
the atoning and covenant-establishing
sacrifice'.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN315){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN315-1 .apnf}
The old temple dies (his body; the sacrificial system), and a new temple
arises (his body, which becomes a corporate house of prayer for all
nations).[16](#appen11.html#NFIN316){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN316-1 .apnf}

## Excursus: an early patristic text linking the Adamic commission to Christ and the church as a temple under construction {.int_niv1}

One early Christian non-canonical text linking the Adamic commission to
Christ and the church to the building of the temple is the *Epistle of
Barnabas* (written around [AD]{.small} 95):

::: cita
^11^So . . . he renewed us \[Christians\] by the forgiveness of sins . .
. as if he were creating us all over again.

^12^For the Scripture speaks about us when he says . . . 'Let us make
man according to our image and likeness, and let them rule over the
beasts of the earth and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea.'
And when he saw that our \[new\] creation was good, the Lord said:
'Increase and multiply and fill the earth' . . .

^13^He made a second creation in the last days. And the Lord says:
'Behold, I make the last things as the first.' It was with reference to
this, therefore, that the prophet proclaimed: 'Enter into a land flowing
with milk and honey, and rule over it.'

^14^Observe, then, that we have been created anew, just as he says . . .
'I will take away from these . . . their stony hearts, and put in hearts
of flesh,' because he was about to be manifested in the flesh and to
dwell in us.

^15^For the dwelling-place of our heart, my brothers, is a holy temple
dedicated to the Lord.

[]{#chap5.html#page_181}^16^. . . 'I will confess you in the
congregation of my brothers' . . . Therefore we are the ones whom he
brought into the good land.

^17^. . . we too, being nourished by faith in the promise and by the
word, will live and rule over the earth.

^18^Now we have already said above: 'And let them increase and multiply
and rule over the fish.' But who is presently able to rule over beasts
or fish or birds of the air? . . .

^19^If, however, this is not now the case, then he has told us when it
will be: when we ourselves have been made perfect, and so become heirs
of the Lord's covenant. (*Barnabas* 6:11--19)
:::

This passage applies Adam's commission, and the same commission renewed
to Israel in the land, to Christ and the church as a new creation and
temple. Christ and the church have begun to fulfil this commission
(*Barnabas* 6:11--17) and it will be fulfilled consummately in the
future (6:18--19) when the church has 'been made perfect'. The passage
is introduced in 6:3 by Christ being called a 'stone that crushes \[Dan.
2:34--35, 45\] . . . a precious stone, especially chosen, a cornerstone'
(Is. 28:16).[17](#appen11.html#NFIN317){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN317-1 .apnf}
Likely this is an implicit reference to Christ as the cornerstone or
beginning of the temple, which is developed in 6:14--15, where Christ is
said to 'dwell in us . . . a holy temple dedicated to the Lord'. The
epistle later understands that the eschatological temple continues
throughout the church age to grow out from Christ (perhaps still with
Christ as the initial foundation stone in the background of thought):
'there is in fact a temple of God . . . \[that\] he is building and
completing', and at the 'end God's temple will be built gloriously'
(16:6). The remainder of the chapter (16:7--10) explains how the temple
'is being built for the Lord' by God 'dwelling in our dwelling place' by
means of people believing in 'the forgiveness of sins', 'setting their
hope' on Christ, and trusting in 'his righteous decrees' and
'commandments'.

*Barnabas* 6:15 identifies the 'dwelling-place of our heart' (i.e., of
the believer) as 'a holy temple dedicated to the Lord', which appears to
focus on an individual, small-scope conception of the temple and not on
the large-scale latter-day temple-theme discussed so far in this book.
Nevertheless, in the context, wider redemptive-historical concerns are
evident, especially in 16:7--10, in particular the mention of the
growing process of the temple construction and its glorious endtime
culmination.

[]{#chap5.html#page_182}The allusion to Ezekiel 11:19 in *Barnabas* 6:14
may also be significant in this respect: '"I will take away from these .
. . their stony hearts, and put in hearts of flesh," because he was
about to be manifested in the flesh and to dwell in us.' The phraseology
is also fraught with notions of God's larger-scale, corporate
tabernacling presence during the exile and the post-exilic
eschatological period, which the immediate context of the Ezekiel
quotation
highlights.[18](#appen11.html#NFIN318){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN318-1 .apnf}
Possibly, for Barnabas, the other side of the coin of Christ dwelling in
believers and creating them into individual temples is that of Christ
himself being a temple (*Barnabas* 6:3), so that when one believes in
Christ one becomes identified with Christ as the temple, a temple which
grows as more and more people become built into it.

That a wider perspective on the temple is included in Barnabas's
discussion is also apparent from recalling that the temple discussion is
put in the context of God 'creating' believers to carry out the
worldwide Adamic commission of Genesis 1:26--28 (*Barnabas* 6:11--12).
One could conceive of the portrayal of Jesus in the Gospels as a temple
to be an individualistic perspective about the temple, which is partly
true, since there the very beginning establishment of the temple is in
mind (i.e., Christ is the individual cornerstone of the temple). Yet the
testimony of the Gospels and the apostolic reflections about Christ as a
temple combine this individualistic messianic notion with his role as a
representative figure. For example, 1 Peter 2:4--9 depicts Christ as the
living cornerstone upon which believers as living stones 'are being
built up as a spiritual house' (likewise Eph.
2:19--22).[19](#appen11.html#NFIN319){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN319-1 .apnf}
The reference to Christ as 'a precious stone, especially chosen, a
cornerstone' (Is. 28:16) in *Barnabas* 6:3, the same wording and
allusion found in 1 Peter, fits in to this idea of a corporate temple
that is growing.

::: {#chap5.html#niv2-058 .niv2}
### Jesus as the destroyer of the old temple and the rebuilder of a new temple {.int_niv2}

Jesus not only begins to take over the role of the old temple but he
forecasts its imminent doom. He prophesies that God will destroy the
temple (Matt. 24 and parallels), not only because it was becoming
obsolete but because of its flawed use and Israel's rejection of Jesus.
Immediately after the cleansing of the temple, an acted-out parable
provides further indication of Jesus' symbolic rejection of the temple.
Jesus sees a fig tree without any fruit, and says '"No longer shall
there []{#chap5.html#page_183}ever be any fruit from you." And at once
the fig tree withered' (Matt. 21:19). The fig tree without fruit
symbolizes Israel's spiritual destitution, and the withering indicated
the temple's and nation's rejection and judgment by God (just as it did
in Jer. 8:11--13, to which allusion is made here) (N. T. Wright 1996:
421--422).[20](#appen11.html#NFIN320){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN320-1 .apnf}
The following statement about 'this mountain' and 'casting' it 'into the
sea' may not merely be a teaching on prayer. It may also be about
judgment on the
temple,[21](#appen11.html#NFIN321){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN321-1 .apnf}
since, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, the temple sometimes
became synonymous with the mount on which it sat.

::: {#chap5.html#niv2-059 .niv2}
### The significance of the parable of the vineyard in relation to Jesus as the 'cornerstone' {.int_niv2}

Matthew 21:33--46 (and parallels) continues the theme of Israel's
rejection through the telling of the parable of the wicked tenant
farmers. A landowner planted a vineyard and rented it to some
vinegrowers. But when the time came to collect rent, the vine-growers
mistreated the landowner's rent collectors, even killing some, including
the landowner's own son. Jesus concludes by saying that the landowner
'will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the
vineyard to other vine-growers, who will pay the proceeds at the proper
seasons' (Matt. 21:41). Jesus alludes to Isaiah 5:1--6, which compares
Israel to a vineyard that God had planted and which he would tear down
because of unfaithfulness. The Aramaic Bible of early Judaism (the
Targum) identified the 'vineyard' in Isaiah 5:2 primarily as Israel's
'sanctuary': with reference to the 'vineyard', this version asserts 'I
built my sanctuary in their midst, and I even gave my altar to atone for
their sins.' Other sectors of Judaism made the same
identification.[22](#appen11.html#NFIN322){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN322-1
.apnf} As a result of Israel's sin, the Isaiah Targum says that God
would remove his glorious presence from the temple and 'break down the
place of their *sanctuaries*' (*Tg. Isaiah*
5:5).[23](#appen11.html#NFIN323){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN323-1 .apnf} This
[]{#chap5.html#page_184}background points to the possibility that Jesus
and the Gospel writers understood the 'vineyard' in Jesus' parable to be
closely associated with the temple, if not identified with it. What
directly follows the parable provides even further intimation of this.

Jesus interprets the parable to mean that Israel's rejection of him
would lead to their destruction (implicitly including their temple), and
the erection of a new temple. In so doing, he appears to be identifying
himself with the 'cornerstone' of a new temple that is being laid in
their midst: 'the stone which the builders rejected, this became the
chief cornerstone'. This quotation from Psalm 118:22 refers to a
righteous sufferer whom God delivered from oppressors. As a result of
his deliverance, he enters through the 'gate of the Lord', which is
likely the gate of the temple courtyard, in light of the following
references in the psalm to the figure being blessed 'from the house of
the L[ORD]{.small}' (v. 26) and to binding 'the festival sacrifice with
cords to the horns of the altar' (v. 27).

Thus, the mention of the 'cornerstone' in Psalm 118:22 probably refers
to part of the foundation of the temple as a metaphor for the righteous
sufferer who has been oppressed not only by the nations (v. 10) but also
by those within the covenant community (metaphorically portrayed as
temple 'builders' who 'rejected' him as the 'chief cornerstone'). This
pious victim then is likely a kingly figure in Israel's history, perhaps
David himself, who had been oppressed both by the nations round about,
as well as by those within Israel.

Jesus applies the psalm's temple 'cornerstone' image to himself. That he
has in mind such a self-identification is pointed to by noticing that
Matthew 21 is also set in the context of the temple: (1) he cleanses the
temple (21:12--13); (2) the physically handicapped come to him in the
temple to be healed (21:14); (3) he is praised in the temple for his
healings (21:15); (4) he speaks the parable of the tenants after he had
'come into the temple' (21:23ff.). Therefore, the implication is that
rejection of Jesus as the 'cornerstone' of the temple ('the stone which
the builders rejected') is equivalent to rejection of Jesus as the true
temple ('this became the chief cornerstone'), which is in the process of
being built. While the cornerstone in the psalm was metaphorical for a
king, here it is likely more than merely figurative but an actual
reference to Jesus, the King of Israel, becoming the foundation stone of
the new temple.[24](#appen11.html#NFIN324){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN324-1
.apnf}

[]{#chap5.html#page_185}That, in fact, Jesus is identifying himself with
the temple becomes clear from Paul's and Peter's later explicit
identification of Jesus with the 'cornerstone' upon which the rest of
the 'temple' of the church is being built and from which it will grow
(Eph. 2:20--22; 1 Pet. 2:4--8, the latter also quoting Ps. 118:22).
Outside the New Testament, the *Epistle of Barnabas* 6:14--15, as we
have seen, also appears to identify Christ as the temple together with
his followers, which also plausibly develops earlier references to him
as the stone of Psalm 118 (*Barnabas* 6:3--4).

That Jesus is portraying himself as the beginning of a new sanctuary is
enhanced by the following statement in Matthew 21:44: 'he who falls on
this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will
scatter him like dust'. Some commentators have rightly noticed that this
second statement about a stone also has an Old Testament background,
this time from Daniel
2:34--35:[25](#appen11.html#NFIN325){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN325-1 .apnf} 'a
stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue . . . and
crushed \[it\]' and it 'became like chaff from the summer threshing
floors; and the wind carried them away . . .'

Recall from our earlier discussion of Daniel 2 that the statue
represented the evil world empires that oppress God's people, and the
stone symbolized God's kingdom of Israel that would destroy and judge
these unbelieving kingdoms. Now, unbelieving Israel has become
identified with pagan kingdoms and is portrayed as being judged along
with them. Remember also that the 'stone' of Daniel's statue, after
smashing the colossus, the evil kingdoms, 'became a great mountain and
filled the whole earth'. I argued in some depth
earlier[26](#appen11.html#NFIN326){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN326-1 .apnf} that
this statement appeared to describe the 'stone' as a foundation stone of
a temple that would expand to fill the entire earth. If this assertion
is correct, then it makes sense why Jesus would follow up his reference
to the temple 'cornerstone' of Psalm 118 with the same temple 'stone' of
Daniel 2.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN327){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN327-1 .apnf} The
temple images from Psalm 118 and Daniel 2 are fitting portrayals of the
victorious act of new creation brought about in Christ's resurrection,
since the Old Testament []{#chap5.html#page_186}temple was symbolic of
the old creation, and Daniel's stone depiction is associated with the
primeval hillock from which the original creation spread (and from which
the land mass spread after Noah's flood in the so-called 'second
creation').

Commentators have noted that there appears to be no logical connection
between the architectural and agricultural imagery in Matthew
21:33--44.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN328){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN328-1 .apnf} It
would seem, however, that the connection lies in the common temple
imagery. Is it mere coincidence that the cultic stone passages of
Psalm 118 and Daniel 2 would be attached as an explanation of the Isaiah
vineyard parable, in light of the fact that Israel's vineyard in Isaiah
5 was viewed by early Judaism to represent the temple? Such a 'vineyard'
image also flows naturally into the following stone passages about the
temple, since we have seen already that both the Old Testament and early
Judaism viewed the Garden of Eden as a temple, and that the interiors of
Israel's tabernacle and temple were constructed on the inside to remind
one of a garden. We are not saying that the Old Testament notions of a
temple being like a garden were at the top of Jesus' mind but that this
may have facilitated to some degree the transition from the picture of
the vineyard to the image of a temple.

Accordingly, Jesus says in Matthew 21:43 that 'the kingdom of God will
be taken away from you, and be given to a nation producing the fruit of
it'. In the context of the preceding vineyard parable, his pronouncement
combines the notions of kingdom and cultic vineyard, which are two sides
of the same coin, just as the 'stone' in Daniel explicitly symbolizes
the 'kingdom' (Dan. 2:44--45) and implicitly also represents the
temple.[29](#appen11.html#NFIN329){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN329-1 .apnf} This
may also be the reason that the image of the withered 'fig tree'
precedes the vineyard parable, since it was a common arboreal image
typically found in botanical descriptions for Israel's prosperous land
throughout the Old
Testament,[30](#appen11.html#NFIN330){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN330-1 .apnf}
its first occurrence being in Genesis 3:7. In particular, since Israel's
land was viewed sometimes as 'the Garden of Eden' with connotations of
the first primal sanctuary, the fig tree would have been a suitable
[]{#chap5.html#page_187}feature to include together with the vineyard
and temple imagery in Matthew 21.

The Old Testament temple represented God's presence on earth, and Jesus
now represents that presence in the midst of his followers. Jesus makes
it abundantly clear in Matthew 24 (and parallels) that Israel's temple
will be destroyed. Nevertheless, another temple would arise instead in
the form of Jesus and his followers.

Perhaps the 'stone' texts of Matthew 21 are anticipated by Jesus'
mention of the 'rock' in chapter 16: 'And I also say to you that you are
Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades
shall not overpower it' (16:18). Though there is debate about to whom
the 'rock' refers, it is certainly possible that it is
Jesus.[31](#appen11.html#NFIN331){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN331-1 .apnf} More
likely, however, the 'rock' is a reference either to Peter's confession
that Jesus is 'the Christ, the Son of the living God' (v. 16) or
preferably to Peter
himself.[32](#appen11.html#NFIN332){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN332-1 .apnf}
Though Jesus is not here the foundation stone, he is certainly the
builder of the new
temple.[33](#appen11.html#NFIN333){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN333-1 .apnf} He
builds his church on the foundation stone of the apostles' teaching (as
Paul later asserts in Eph. 2:19--22), which, of course, is about
himself. In view of the entire Gospel of Matthew, Jesus builds both on
the foundation stone of himself and the disciples. In this light, it is
natural that the place of forgiveness of sins in the next verse (v. 19)
would be transferred from Israel's old temple to the new temple of the
church, where forgiveness in Jesus is proclaimed to the
world.[34](#appen11.html#NFIN334){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN334-1 .apnf} In
verse 19, Jesus introduces the means of forgiveness in the new age by
saying, 'I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,' showing
that the authoritative basis for dealing with sins has passed from the
old temple to the new ecclesiological community, which may here be
conceived to be a new
temple.[35](#appen11.html#NFIN335){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN335-1 .apnf}

If Matthew 16:19 is an allusion to Isaiah 22, it might enhance the
[]{#chap5.html#page_188}possibility that Jesus is speaking about the
temple. Isaiah 22:22 portrays Eliakim, prime minister to king Hezekiah,
as having 'the key of the house of David on his shoulder' because he
controlled who could enter into the king's presence and service. There
were priestly connotations associated with Eliakim's kingly
administration, since Isaiah 22:21 portrays him clothed with a 'tunic'
and a 'sash securely about him'. The Aramaic translation of Isaiah 22:22
says that God 'will place the key of the sanctuary and the authority of
the house of David in his hand'. And then Isaiah 22:24 (of the Aramaic
version) says that even Eliakim's relatives will be 'priests wearing the
ephod'. Like Eliakim, Christ establishes himself as having an
authoritative position in the new temple in Matthew 16:18, and then
extends his priestly authority to his disciples, who also have priestly
authority. Matthew 16:19, in the light of 18:15--18 and John 20:23, says
they express what would appear to be their priestly task by declaring
who is forgiven and who is not. Revelation 3:7 portrays Christ as having
the 'keys' of Isaiah 22:22 and relates these 'keys' to his followers
being able eventually to become 'a pillar in the temple of My God' (cf.
Rev. 3:8--9 with Rev. 3:12). 'Keys of the temple' are also said to be in
the possession of priests in 1 Chronicles 9:27 and *2 Baruch* 10:18. In
both Isaiah 22 and *2 Baruch*, the keys are being taken away from
unworthy keepers in Israel and transferred elsewhere, which appears to
be the case here in Matthew 16: could the idea be that the keys to the
true temple are being taken from old Israel and transferred to true
Israel, Jesus and his
followers?[36](#appen11.html#NFIN336){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN336-1 .apnf}

In light of the evidence above, it should not be surprising to observe
that in the context directly preceding and following Matthew 16:18--19
Jesus identifies himself as 'Son of Man' three times (16:13, 27--28),
and Peter identifies him as 'Son of God' (16:16). These names, as we
have already seen, show that Jesus is doing what Adam and Israel should
have done. He is the 'Son of Adam' who does what his human father failed
to do. He is the 'Son of God', which not only was a name for Adam but
also for the corporate Adam, Israel, who was disobedient to their divine
father.

### The significance of the tearing of the temple veil at the time of Christ's death {.int_niv2}

This discussion of Jesus as the beginning of the new temple in
replacement of the old in Matthew 21 may also be the best context
[]{#chap5.html#page_189}within which to understand Matthew 27:40, where,
in virtual repetition of 26:61, those mocking Jesus say, 'You who are
going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself!
If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross' (see the parallels
in Mark 14:58 and
15:29).[37](#appen11.html#NFIN337){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN337-1 .apnf} Then,
after Jesus 'yielded up his spirit' on the cross, Matthew discloses that
'the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the
earth shook; and the rocks were split, and the tombs were opened; and
many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised' (Matt.
27:50--52).

Irony is neatly woven throughout this passage. Jesus is mocked because
he said that he would tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days,
and at virtually the same time Matthew tells us that Jesus actually was
in the process of destroying the temple when he died. That the 'veil of
the temple was torn in two' in verse 51 is a direct result of his death
in verse 50. The temple veil was a part of the temple, so that its
tearing symbolically represented the destruction of the temple.
Commentators have never successfully explained why the mention of the
torn temple veil is part of language describing the breakup of the world
in the phrases of Matthew 27 that follow directly.

When, however, it is remembered from the Old Testament and early Judaism
that on the veil was embroidery of the starry heavens, its tearing would
be an apt symbol of the beginning destruction, not only of the temple
(which itself even as a whole symbolized the cosmos) but of the very
cosmos itself. Consequently, though the text does not explicitly point
out to readers the cosmic embroidery on the veil, this implicit reality
suggests that the veil's destruction is compatible and admirably fits
with the mention of darkening of the sun (so Luke 23:44--45),
earthquake, splitting of rocks, and raising of believers (vv.
51--53).[38](#appen11.html#NFIN338){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN338-1 .apnf} Luke
23:44--45 adds that 'darkness fell over the whole land', and 'the sun
failed' at the time 'the veil of the temple was torn in two', adding
further to the language of cosmic conflagration. These were not signs of
the final destruction of the cosmos but signs that it had begun in
Jesus' death, and that his resurrection (v. 53) was the beginning of a
[]{#chap5.html#page_190}new
creation.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN339){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN339-1 .apnf}
Jesus' statement in Luke 23:43, that he and the believing criminal would
be together 'in Paradise \[or the Garden\]' immediately after their
death, suggests further that Jesus' death was in fact a pathway leading
to a new creational Eden, apparently beginning to fulfil the intention
of the primeval garden
sanctuary.[40](#appen11.html#NFIN340){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN340-1 .apnf}
His subsequent resurrection as new creation was the formal rebuilding of
the temple.

Also likely in mind is the more traditional interpretation of the
tearing of the veil, whereby immediate access into God's holy presence
is signified. Nevertheless, like the embroidery on the veil, this idea
is not mentioned in any of the passion contexts of the Gospels. This
association with the veil, however, is clearly and repeatedly found in
the Old Testament, and, therefore, it is probably implied in the
Gospels' narrative. Thus, the rending of the veil indicates both a
cosmic and cultic reality: the inbreaking destruction of the old
creation and inauguration of the new creation, which introduces access
for all believers to God's holy presence in a way that was not available
in the old creation.

It is difficult to know whether the veil was the outer veil covering the
entrance to the holy place or the veil separating the holy place from
the holy of holies, but both contained heavenly
symbolism.[41](#appen11.html#NFIN341){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN341-1 .apnf}
Nevertheless, several considerations may point to the latter as more
likely. Part of our argument throughout the book so far has been that
the goal of the old temple was that God's presence would break out of
the holy of holies and encompass the rest of the visible cosmos, as
represented by the outer two sections of the temple. Some argue that the
outer veil is in view, since Jewish and Jewish-Christian sources allude
to an amazing event that occurred at the outer door of the Herodian
temple before its
destruction.[42](#appen11.html#NFIN342){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN342-1 .apnf}
On the other hand, though the word 'veil' (*katapetasma*) can refer in
the Greek Old Testament to []{#chap5.html#page_191}either the outer or
inner veil, the latter is more likely, since its tearing would connote
that Jesus' death 'opened up access to the holy of holies', which
carries more apparent theological significance than a reference to the
outer curtain.[43](#appen11.html#NFIN343){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN343-1
.apnf}

That the inner veil had more theological importance is supported by
recalling that there was both a *door* and curtain at the entrance to
the temple, but only a veil separated the holy place and holy of holies,
the latter where God's presence dwelt. Only the high priest could pass
through that inner veil, and even then he could do that only once a year
(so Hooker 1991: 377). Thus, the tearing of the innermost veil would
provide a clearer symbol that the barrier between God and mankind had
been removed. The obvious point, therefore, is that the inner veil was
next to the holiest place in the entire temple, the holy of holies, and,
hence, carried more significance. The only other uses of 'veil'
(*katapetasma*) in relation to Christ's death in early Christian
writings refer to the inner veil (Heb. 6:19; 9:3; 10:20), which also
suggests that the same notion is being discussed in the Synoptics (the
Coptic *Gospel of Phillip* 85 also refers to the inner veil). However,
which veil was torn does not ultimately affect our larger argument,
since both the inner and outer veils contained symbols of the cosmos.

In this respect, the fact that centurions both witnessed the opening of
Christ's tomb and confessed him as 'the Son of God' shows that Jesus was
finally confessed to be whom the mockers sarcastically said he was. The
confession shows further that the ultimate design of the temple was
beginning to be fulfilled in Jesus' resurrection: Yahweh's revelatory
presence was extending out beyond the boundaries of ethnic Israel to
include Gentiles.[44](#appen11.html#NFIN344){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN344-1
.apnf} The centurion's confession was the beginning of the prophetic
fulfilment that the eschatological temple []{#chap5.html#page_192}would
be the place to which God 'will bring' foreigners (Is. 56:7) and 'the
nations would stream' (Is. 2:2--3; Mic. 4:1--3).

Early Judaism understood that when 'the curtain of the temple will be
torn' it would signify Israel's disobedience (*Testament of Levi* 10:3;
cf. *Lives of the Prophets* 12:12) and early Christian tradition
believed that at the time 'the temple curtain will be torn . . . the
Spirit of God will move on to all the nations as fire is poured out'
(Christian interpolation in *Testament of Benjamin*
9:3).[45](#appen11.html#NFIN345){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN345-1 .apnf} These
references understand the tearing of the temple curtain to indicate
either Israel's disobedience or the entrance of Gentiles into the true
faith. It is the case also with the Gospels' episode. Christ was
recreating the temple in himself so that it would finally fulfil its
worldencompassing
purpose.[46](#appen11.html#NFIN346){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN346-1 .apnf}

## Jesus as the temple of the new creation in John {.int_niv1}

Like Matthew 26 -- 27, John 2 confirms the analysis in Matthew 21 that
the 'vineyard' and 'stone' convey the notion of an old temple being
replaced by a new one. John 2:14--22 also begins with the cleansing of
the temple episode (vv. 14--17). The Jews ask Jesus in verse 18 'what
sign do you show to us' to demonstrate by what authority he had cleansed
the temple. He responds by saying, 'Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up' (v. 19). The Jews respond, 'It took forty-six
years to build this temple, and You will raise it up in three days?' (v.
20). John concludes by saying that 'He was speaking of the temple of His
body' (v. 21) and that, after Christ had been resurrected, they
identified his resurrection with his promise of raising the temple (v.
22).

It is possible that Christ is not referring to the old Israelite temple
[]{#chap5.html#page_193}at all when he speaks of 'destroying' the
temple. He may well be referring to his own person that had begun to
replace the temple and that would be destroyed by death and then be
rebuilt again by resurrection. If so, his resurrection would be an
escalated form of the new temple that had begun to exist in Jesus during
his pre-crucifixion ministry. More likely, Jesus' statement about
destroying and raising up the temple was a double entendre: on one level
he was speaking of the old temple that he would tear down and raise up
in new form, though he also had in mind the destruction of his own body
as a temple that would be raised up
again.[47](#appen11.html#NFIN347){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN347-1 .apnf} The
spiritual destruction of Israel's temple occurred decisively at Jesus'
death and resurrection, and its physical demise came finally in
[AD]{.small} 70.

That Jesus had in mind both the destruction of Israel's old temple and
his body as the temple and the replacement of it with his resurrection
body as the new temple may also be suggested by Mark 14:58, where Mark
gives prominence to a revealing but false testimony concerning Jesus:
'We heard Him say, "I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in
three days I will build another made without hands."' A chiasm could be
apparent in Mark 15:23--38, which develops the theme of Jesus as the new
temple by means of a five-fold chiasm. One of the five self-interpreting
parallel pairs is the following:

If this chiasm is present, then Mark interprets the 'unveiling' of Jesus
(stripping him) to be the 'unveiling' of the temple. Accordingly, the
crucifixion would be the destruction, not only of Christ's body as a
temple, but the demise of the old temple itself and the release of the
divine presence from the holy of holies, which has its first effect in
the conversion of the centurion (v. 39) (though God's presence had
probably already left Israel's sanctuary much
earlier).[48](#appen11.html#NFIN348){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN348-1 .apnf}
Thus, even before the formal rebuilding of the new temple by
resurrection, we might []{#chap5.html#page_194}venture to say that the
crucifixion was the destruction of the old temple in the midst of which
the new holy of holies had already begun to emerge invisibly in the very
face of the Roman
soldier,[49](#appen11.html#NFIN349){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN349-1 .apnf} whom
John himself later has in mind in his account of the two centurions who
were present at Jesus' crucifixion (see John
19:32--37).[50](#appen11.html#NFIN350){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN350-1 .apnf}

It is the resurrection that marks the first visible act of temple
rebuilding. Acts 6:13--14 together with Acts 7:47--50 also points to the
Synoptic and Johannine interpretation that Jesus' resurrection was the
rebuilding of the new temple in replacement of the old (as does
*Barnabas* 16).[51](#appen11.html#NFIN351){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN351-1
.apnf} The Mark and Acts texts shed the same light on the shorter
statements in Matt. 26:61, 27:40 and Mark 15:29, which are parallels to
John 2:19.[52](#appen11.html#NFIN352){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN352-1 .apnf}

Jesus' 'building' of the new temple through his resurrection was,
broadly speaking, a fulfilment of Zechariah 6:12--13, even though that
Old Testament passage is not expressly cited anywhere in the New
Testament. In the Zechariah text, the messianic 'Branch' is prophesied
to 'build the temple' and rule in
glory.[53](#appen11.html#NFIN353){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN353-1 .apnf} Even
the earlier promise in 2 Samuel 7:12--13 'that God's house would be
built by the Son of David naturally pointed to the final building of the
temple as the task of the Messiah', David's son (so Clowney 1972: 171).
Strikingly, the Aramaic rendering of Isaiah 53:5 says that the Messiah
'will build the sanctuary which was profaned for our sins' (likewise,
*Sibylline Oracles* []{#chap5.html#page_195}5:415--424). The initial
fulfilment shows that Jesus' resurrection body itself is the material
for the beginning phase of that building project. Consequently, it would
be wrong to conclude, as some do, that Jesus was merely like a temple.
It is true enough that he, indeed, is 'like' a temple, but that is
because he *is* the beginning fulfilment of these endtime prophecies
concerning the building of the temple.

The reference to Jesus as a temple in John 2 is presumably a development
of John 1:14: 'And the Word became flesh, and *tabernacled* among us,
and we beheld His glory.' The special revelatory presence of God,
formerly contained in the holy of holies of the tabernacle and temple,
has now burst forth into the world in the form of the incarnate God,
Jesus Christ. Then, Jesus says in John 1:51: 'you shall see the heavens
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
Man'. This is an allusion to Genesis 28:12, where God appeared to Jacob
at Bethel, and, in response, Jacob established a small sanctuary. There
Jacob saw steps ascending to heaven and angels going up and down on
them. The point of that vision was that this was a temporary sanctuary,
where there was a link between heaven and earth. This little temple at
Bethel was a precursor of the large temple to be built in Jerusalem,
which became the permanent place in Israel, and the ancient world, where
God's presence in heaven was linked to the earth (for the fuller
discussion, see ch. 3 above).

Jesus' identification of himself with the temple stairway of Genesis 28
is thus another way of claiming that he, not the Jerusalem temple, is
the primary link between heaven and
earth.[54](#appen11.html#NFIN354){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN354-1 .apnf}
Therefore, Jacob's small sanctuary in Genesis 28 did not point merely to
the temporary Jerusalem temple but ultimately to the permanent temple
built by Christ. One need not go to the Jerusalem temple to be near
God's revelatory presence but only need trust in Jesus to experience
that presence. This is why Jesus says that the time was dawning when
true worship would not occur at the Jerusalem temple, nor any other holy
site, but would be directed toward the Father (and, by implication,
through the Messiah) in the sphere of the coming eschatological Spirit
of Jesus (John 4:21--26). A link with heaven would be created by the
Spirit wherever there was trust in Christ, and those so trusting would
come within the sphere of the true temple consisting of Christ and his
Spirit.

[]{#chap5.html#page_196}That Jesus identifies himself as 'the Son of
Man' who is the stairway between heaven and earth appears to be a way of
indicating that he is finally doing what Adam and Israel should have
done: he is building a permanent temple that has begun to link heaven to
earth. Our earlier study of Noah, the patriarchs and Israel showed that
interwoven with their inchoate temple-building activities was the
reapplied commission to Adam to multiply, fill the earth, subdue it,
rule over it and be a blessing. We saw the way this commission was to be
carried out was by building temples and then expanding their borders
until, ideally, they would circumscribe the whole earth. This
recommission was a central feature of the sanctuary-building episode in
Genesis 28 (see 28:13--15). Christ is affirming that he is the true Adam
('Son of Man \[Adam\]') and true Israel (i.e., Jacob's seed), and, along
with this, he may also be affirming that he has finally begun to fulfil
successfully the commission of Genesis 1:26--28 and to complete Jacob's
earlier small-scale building activity by establishing the true temple
and increasing its borders throughout the earth. With the coming of
Jesus the foundation stone of the new temple has been moved into place
and nothing can thwart its building process.

Temple imagery may also be expressed when Jesus tells the Samaritan
woman at Jacob's well that he is the source of 'living water' which will
'spring up to eternal life' for those drinking from him (John 4:10--14).
Just as water had its source in the first sanctuary in Eden and flowed
down and became a life-giving element, likewise Ezekiel, alluding to the
Garden of Eden, prophesied that the same thing would be the case with
the end-time temple to be built in the new Jerusalem (Ezek. 47:1--12):
'Then he brought me back to the door of the house \[the holy of
holies\]; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the
house toward the east' (v. 1); 'so everything will live where the river
goes' (v. 9b; so also v.
12).[55](#appen11.html#NFIN355){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN355-1 .apnf} Joel
3:18 ('a spring will go out from the house of the L[ORD]{.small}') and
Zechariah 14:8 ('living waters will flow out of Jerusalem') prophesy the
same reality. John's Apocalypse sees the consummate future fulfilment of
Ezekiel's, Joel's and Zechariah's prophecies and restoration of an
escalated Eden, in which 'a river of the water of life, clear as
crystal', comes 'from the throne of God and of the Lamb' (Rev. 22:1),
who just a few verses earlier have been identified as the 'sanctuary'
(Rev. 21:22).

In light of this background and of the discussion so far about Jesus
[]{#chap5.html#page_197}as the new temple in John's Gospel, Jesus' offer
of 'living water' to the Samaritan woman should be viewed as another
reference to him being the beginning form of the true temple from which
true life in God's presence proceeds. John 7:37--39 confirms this
connection. Teaching in the temple on the last day of the Feast of
Tabernacles, Jesus says, 'If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and
drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost
being shall flow rivers of living water.' But this He spoke of the
Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive, for the Spirit
was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.'

In verse 38 Jesus alludes to the prophecy of water flowing from the
temple in Ezekiel, Joel and
Zechariah.[56](#appen11.html#NFIN356){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN356-1 .apnf}
The 'innermost being' from which 'flow rivers of living water' is Jesus
himself as the new 'holy of holies' and not the one who believes in
Jesus.[57](#appen11.html#NFIN357){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN357-1 .apnf} This
is apparent, first, from recalling that the Old Testament prophecies
identify the source of the water to be from the innermost part of the
temple (i.e., the holy of holies) where Yahweh's presence had dwelt in
the past and would dwell again in the latter-day temple. Jesus was that
presence on earth. Secondly, John 7:39 interprets the 'living water' to
be the Spirit poured out at Pentecost by Jesus himself to all those who
would believe in him (see Acts 2:32--38).

John 7:37 tells us that Jesus spoke the words of John 7:37--39 'on the
last day, the great day of the feast' of Tabernacles, at which time was
a special water drawing and pouring ritual (*m. Sukkah*
4.9--10).[58](#appen11.html#NFIN358){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN358-1 .apnf}
[]{#chap5.html#page_198}The timing of Jesus' pronouncement may have
enhanced further his identification with the water of the new temple.

That Jesus is the source of the end-time temple's water (= the Spirit)
may find further confirmation from John 20:22, which is anticipatory of
Pentecost, where the resurrected Christ 'breathed on them \[the
disciples\] and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."' It is no
coincidence that some commentators have observed that this act of
'breathing' echoes Genesis 2:7, where God 'breathed' (the same Greek
word as in John 20) into Adam 'the breath of life, and Adam became a
living being'. In the preceding verse (v. 21), Christ says, 'as the
Father has sent Me, I also send you'. This is another episode like the
'Great Commission' given in Matthew 28:18--20, which we have seen is
plausibly to be understood as a renewal of the commission given to Adam.
In this sense, this event is different from the subsequent event of
Pentecost, when many more received the Spirit.

Therefore, the allusion to Genesis 2:7 takes on more significance: Jesus
is empowering his followers not with physical life, as with Adam, but
with spiritual empowerment to do what Adam and others had failed to do
(note the parallel empowerment formula in Matt. 28:20, 'I am with you
always'). The Twelve are commissioned as the representative bridgehead
of the new humanity, the new
Israel.[59](#appen11.html#NFIN359){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN359-1 .apnf}
Pentecost shows this bridgehead expanding further with a greater
outpouring of the Spirit.

Could John 20:22 be a development of the promise of the Spirit from John
7, which we have argued is associated with the new temple in Jesus (John
7:39)? A positive answer to this question may be pointed to by observing
that this is the first time the language of 'receiving the Spirit' in
application to Jesus' followers has occurred since John 7:39 ('but this
He spoke of *the Spirit*, whom *those who believed in Him were to
receive*'). The link with John 7 is suggested further by noticing that
John 7:39 affirmed that the Spirit would not be given until Jesus had
been glorified ('for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified'). One might be able to say that Jesus' glorification had
begun with the
resurrection,[60](#appen11.html#NFIN360){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN360-1 .apnf}
even []{#chap5.html#page_199}though his full glorification at his
ascension had not yet happened (or alternatively, the resurrection, at
least, was the beginning of a process inextricably linked to the
glorification at the ascension). If this link with John 7 can be
maintained, then Jesus' breathing the Spirit on the disciples could be
considered a part of a commission of and an enablement for them to be
part of the new temple and to expand its borders, so that others in the
world may be included (on which see John
17:18--23).[61](#appen11.html#NFIN361){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN361-1 .apnf}
The primary message they are to announce in their mission is the
forgiveness of sins (v. 23), which, as we have seen in the Synoptic
Gospels, became the function of Jesus instead of Jerusalem's temple. In
fact, we saw that the announcement of forgiveness in Matthew 16:19 may
have been the equivalent message given to Jesus' followers as a result
of their identification with him as the 'foundation rock of the new
temple'. Now, similarly, the followers of Jesus have authority to
announce the same message for the same reason: 'If you forgive the sins
of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of
any, they have been
retained.'[62](#appen11.html#NFIN362){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN362-1 .apnf}
Just as God's breathing into Adam made him part of the first creation
and resulted in his being placed into the gardentemple, so Jesus'
breathing into the disciples might well be considered to incorporate
them into the new
creation[63](#appen11.html#NFIN363){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN363-1 .apnf} and
temple. They are part of the temple, and they announce the life-giving
forgiveness that can come only from Christ, the centre and foundation of
the temple and, hence, also of the new creation of which the old temples
were emblematic.

Thus, though the mention of the 'temple' does not occur in John 20, it
has some unique language and ideas there in common with the prophecy of
John 7, so that Jesus' address to the disciples would appear to be
linked to John 7. Not only this, but the John 20
[]{#chap5.html#page_200}passage would seem also to be associated to some
degree with the new temple, since the earlier promise of John 7 itself
was formulated by allusions to Old Testament end-time prophecies about
the temple.[64](#appen11.html#NFIN364){#chap5.html#ap_NFIN364-1 .apnf}

If the anticipation of Pentecost in John 20 is linked to Jesus and his
followers as the beginning form of a new temple, it might not be
unexpected to find that the actual event of Pentecost is likewise
associated. A few observations point in this direction.

::: {#chap6.html#niv2-061 .niv2}
### The relationship between the tongues of Babel and Pentecost {.int_niv2}

The speaking in tongues at Pentecost is best seen first within its
redemptive-historical context of the whole Bible. The 'tongues' result
in people from different parts of the ancient world with different
languages hearing 'each . . . speak in his own language' (Acts 2:8). The
list of the different nations represented by Diaspora Jews at Pentecost
in Acts 2:9--11 alludes in abbreviated manner to 'the Table of Nations'
in Genesis 10: 'Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of
Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and
Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors
from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs . .
.'[2](#appen11.html#NFIN366){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN366-1 .apnf}

The allusion to Genesis 10 has been anticipated in Luke 10:1--12. There,
after Luke 9:1--6 narrates the sending out of the twelve disciples
(representing the tribes of Israel, Luke 22:30), Jesus sends out seventy
(or seventy-two) witnesses. They represent the nations of the world to
be evangelized, since seventy (or seventy-two) nations was the
traditional number associated with the number of nations listed in
Genesis 10 (Scott 1995:
162--163).[3](#appen11.html#NFIN367){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN367-1 .apnf}
These were the nations who had []{#chap6.html#page_202}been disobedient
to the commission of 'multiplying', 'swarming in the earth' and
'filling' it (see Gen. 9:1, 6--7, which develops Genesis
1:28).[4](#appen11.html#NFIN368){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN368-1 .apnf} They
had united at Babel in an attempt to force God to come down to them. In
response, God did come down at Babel, but in judgment by 'confusing'
their 'tongues' (*Sibylline Oracles* 3:105; Josephus, *Ant*. 1.117,
120), so that they could not understand one another. The judgment also
entailed them being 'scattered . . . over the face of the whole earth'
(Gen. 11:1--9). They were forced to do what they should have done in
submission to Genesis 1:28 and 9:1, 6--7 but which they had refused to
do.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN369){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN369-1 .apnf} Although
they did not spread out voluntarily to fulfil the Adamic
commission,[6](#appen11.html#NFIN370){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN370-1 .apnf} a
remnant did begin to obey -- Abraham and his seed.

The mention of representatives of these nations being in Jerusalem
together with the presence of 'tongues' (Acts 2:3) and different
'dialects' (Acts 2:6--8) strengthens an intended link to Genesis 10 --
11, since there also different languages played such a crucial part in
what happened.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN371){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN371-1 .apnf}
The theophany at Babel, like that in Acts 2:2, also was thought to have
manifested itself in a strong 'wind' (Josephus, *Ant*. 1.118; *Sibylline
Oracles* 3:101--102) and 'various sounds' (*Sibylline Oracles* 3:106).
Why does Luke want readers to see the link to Genesis 10 -- 11? Babel's
sin of uniting and consequent judgment of confused languages and of
people being scattered throughout the earth is reversed at Pentecost:
God causes representatives from the same scattered nations to unite in
Jerusalem in order that they might receive the blessing of understanding
different languages as if all these languages were one.

The reversal of Babel may be indicated even by the common
[]{#chap6.html#page_203}element of tongues causing 'confusion' (cf.
Acts 2:6, 'they were confused'): whereas unintelligible tongues caused
confusion at Babel, at Pentecost intelligible tongues are so startling
and unexpected that confusion of amazement
resulted.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN372){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN372-1 .apnf} The
purpose of having a unified understanding is to demonstrate the power of
the eschatological Spirit in attesting to Jesus' death, resurrection and
ascension to the heavenly throne to reign as cosmic king. Under the
kingship of Jesus and through the power of his Spirit the
representatives of these nations were to 'scatter' again and subdue the
powers of evil by filling the earth with God's presence, just as Jesus'
smaller band of seventy witnesses had begun to do during his earthly
ministry. The precise manner by which they were to do this was by
'witnessing' through the power of the Spirit in word and deed on behalf
of Jesus Christ (see Acts 1:8).

That the events of Pentecost likely took place in the Jerusalem temple
is appropriate (cf. Acts 2:1--2, 46). The judgment at Babel occurred as
a result of the people uniting to build a temple tower in order to force
God to come down from heaven in blessing. Such cultic towers were
typical of the time in ancient Mesopotamia. Their purpose was to serve
as a gateway between heaven and earth whereby the god could come down
and even refresh himself on the way to the earthly
temple.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN373){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN373-1 .apnf} Like
Babel's temple tower, the Jerusalem temple was intended to be the link
between heaven and earth. Because of Israel's sin, however, their
earthly temple was about to be judged, as we have already seen
prophesied by Jesus in the Gospels. Israel believed their temple to be
the emblem that they were God's chosen people. In fact, however, God's
presence had long since appeared to have departed from the temple
because of their rebellion, idolatry and apostasy (Ezek. 11:22--25, *Tg.
Isaiah* 5:5; *Midrash Rabbah Numbers *15:10; *Midrash Rabbah
Lamentations*, Proem 24; and *b. Yoma* 21b may point to this, though
Matt. 23:21; *Sirach* 24:8--34; Josephus, *War* 6.299, *m. Sukkah* 5:4,
and *Midrash Rabbah Exodus* 2:2 could point in the other direction; on
which, see Davies 1991: 32--36). As we will see, Stephen reiterates this
judgment, and like Jesus, he is also killed for it (Acts 6:11--15;
7:48--50). The Gospels also affirm that Jesus himself began to replace
the old temple during his ministry and more climactically at his
resurrection (John 2:19--22; Matt. 26:61; 27:40; Mark 14:58; 15:29).

### []{#chap6.html#page_204}Pentecost as a fulfilment of Jesus' prophecy of the temple {.int_niv2}

Hints of a *new* spiritual temple may also be discernible in Acts 2.
Such hints should not be surprising, if we have been correct to identify
the anticipatory Pentecost of John 20:21--23 with the Holy Spirit as an
expression of the new temple in fulfilment of Jesus' own prophecy of the
temple in John 7:37--39. Just as in John 20, the coming of the Spirit
indicates a shift in redemptive history whereby forgiveness of sins
derives from Jesus instead of the physical temple and is announced by
Jesus' priestly followers instead of Israel's temple priests (e.g.,
Acts 2:38: 'Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus
Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift
of the Holy Spirit').

::: {#chap6.html#niv2-063 .niv2}
### Tongues of Pentecost as a theophany of a latter-day Sinai sanctuary {.int_niv2}

The appearance of 'tongues as of fire' is an expression of the coming
Spirit that reflects a theophany, which appears to be associated with
the heavenly temple. A number of considerations point to this. First,
the mention that 'there came from heaven a noise like a violent, rushing
wind' and that there appeared 'tongues as of fire' calls to mind the
typical theophanies of the Old Testament. God appeared in these
theophanies with a thunderous noise and in the form of fire. The first
great theophany of the Old Testament was at Sinai, where God appeared in
the midst of loud 'voices and torches and a thick cloud' and 'fire'
(e.g., Exod. 19:16--20; 20:18). This was the model theophany for most
later similar divine appearances in the Old Testament, and to some
degree God's coming at Sinai stands in the background of the Spirit's
coming at Pentecost.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN374){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN374-1
.apnf} The fact that Pentecost celebrated not only the firstfruits of
harvest but also, beginning in the second century [BC]{.small},
commemoration of God's giving of the Law to Moses at Sinai points
further to the presence of that background in
Acts 2.[11](#appen11.html#NFIN375){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN375-1 .apnf}

If our earlier analysis of Sinai as a sanctuary is correct, then the
theophany at Pentecost also may be understood as the irrupting of a
newly emerging temple in the midst of the old Jerusalem temple that was
passing away. This description, and the way it was developed in
[]{#chap6.html#page_205}early Judaism, is similar to that at Pentecost,
where people saw 'tongues of fire being distributed'
(Acts 2:3).[12](#appen11.html#NFIN376){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN376-1 .apnf}
In fact, while Luke's account of Pentecost contains no direct reference
to the Sinai
theophany,[13](#appen11.html#NFIN377){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN377-1 .apnf}
there are links and even more 'indirect allusions' than we have shown

Pentecost.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN378){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN378-1 .apnf}

### 'Tongues of fire' in the Old Testament as a theophany from a heavenly sanctuary {.int_niv2}

Sinai is not the only background that portrays the image of speech in
the midst of fire. The actual phrase 'tongues as of fire' occurs in two
Old Testament passages. Isaiah 30:27--30 refers to God 'descending' from
his temple ('a remote place' and 'the mountain of the L[ORD]{.small}')
appearing in 'dense . . . smoke . . . His *tongue like a consuming fire*
\[Theodotion reads: *hē glōssa autou hōs pur esthion*\] . . . in the
flame of a consuming fire', and 'the L[ORD]{.small} will cause His voice
of authority to be heard'. This itself alludes to the prototypical Sinai
theophany (likewise a 'tongue of fire' \[Aquila, Symmachus and
Theodotion read *glōssa puros*\] occurs as an emblem of judgment in
Isaiah 5:24--25 with allusion to the Sinai
theophany).[15](#appen11.html#NFIN379){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN379-1 .apnf}
The 'tongue like a consuming fire' connotes God's judgment and could be
different from the same image in Acts 2 (*glōssai hōsei puros*), since
there it appears to be a sign only of blessing. That the same flaming
image even in Acts, however, may also allude both to blessing and
judgment is apparent from the Sinai backdrop, where the fiery theophany
was associated with both blessing (the giving of the Law) and judgment
(for those entering too close to the theophany or rebelling: cf. Exod.
19:12--24; 32:25--29). We will see below that the background of the Joel
2 quotation in Acts 2 confirms a dual blessing--cursing theme.
Consequently, Isaiah's linking of []{#chap6.html#page_206}'tongues of
fire' to God's theophanic presence in a temple points even further to
the same link in Acts 2.

::: {#chap6.html#niv2-065 .niv2}
### Tongues in Judaism as a theophany from a heavenly sanctuary {.int_niv2}

There are some early Jewish writings that could show some awareness of
or be inspired by the Old Testament image of 'tongues of fire' being
associated with a divine theophany in a heavenly or earthly temple. The
phrase 'tongues of fire' also occurs in these Jewish passages. Perhaps a
parallel to the fiery 'tongues' of Acts 2:3 is *1 Enoch*
14:8--25.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN380){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN380-1 .apnf}
There Enoch ascends in a vision to the heavenly temple. Enoch comes to
the wall of the outer court that was 'surrounded by tongues of fire',
and he 'entered into the tongues of fire' (14:9--10). He then enters
through the holy place and is able to peer into the holy of holies,
which was 'built with tongues of fire' (14:15). Likewise, in *1 Enoch*
71:5 Enoch sees a temple-like 'structure built of crystals; and between
those crystals tongues of living fire'. Thus, the 'tongues of fire' form
part of the heavenly temple and contribute to the overall effect of the
burning theophany in the holy of holies, where 'the flaming fire was
around about him, and a great fire stood before him' (14:22).

What could such a heavenly scene have to do with the earthly scene of
Pentecost depicted in Acts 2? It is possible that the wording 'tongues
of fire' in *Enoch* is a mere coincidental parallel to Acts 2. On the
other hand, the contextual usage of the wording there may have some
overlap with the use of the same phrase in Acts 2. The *Enoch* passage
may possibly be a creative development of the above Exodus and Isaiah
texts, which themselves appear to be developments of imagery from the
Sinai theophany. In the light of this *Enoch* text, could it be that the
descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost 'from heaven' in the form of
'tongues of fire' is to be conceived as the descent of God's
tabernacling presence from his heavenly
temple?[17](#appen11.html#NFIN381){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN381-1 .apnf} Since
the heavenly temple is partly pictured by 'tongues of fire', it might be
appropriate that the descent of that temple would be pictured with the
same thing. Thus, it may be perceivable that, just as the heavenly
temple was constructed of 'tongues of fire', the new temple on earth
(God's people []{#chap6.html#page_207}vivified by the Spirit) that had
descended from heaven was beginning to be built with the same fiery
image. This suggestion may gain more force when seen in the light of the
other observations throughout this section which point from different
angles to Pentecost as a phenomenon expressing the divine theophanic
presence *in the temple*.

In addition, the Dead Sea Scrolls interpret the Urim and Thummim stones
to have shone gloriously with 'tongues of fire' (1Q29). The Urim and
Thummim were two stones placed in a pouch in the high priest's
breastplate (Exod. 28:30; Lev. 8:8). He was to carry them 'when he
enters the holy place . . . before the L[ORD]{.small} continually'
(Exod. 28:29--30). Likely, these stones were one of the means by which
God's prophetic revelation came. They apparently would be cast by the
priest or drawn out of the pouch ceremonially, and the way they came out
revealed a 'yes' or 'no' answer to the question at
hand.[18](#appen11.html#NFIN382){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN382-1 .apnf} Qumran
(1Q29; 4Q376) understands the Urim and Thummim to have shone with
'tongues of fire', when God gave the prophetic answer in the midst of
his theophanic cloud to the high priest's question about whether a
prophet is true or
false.[19](#appen11.html#NFIN383){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN383-1 .apnf}

Therefore, once more we have the 'tongues of fire' as a phenomenon
occurring within the 'holy of holies' or, more probably, the 'holy
place' of the temple as an expression of God's revelatory presence (it
might be recalled from an earlier chapter that the pouch containing the
Urim and Thumim symbolized the holy of holies). This time, however, it
is the earthly and not the heavenly temple that is the focus. Even more
striking is that the 'tongues' is an occurrence not merely of God's
revelatory presence but of his prophetic communication. This is, of
course, what happens at Pentecost: not only are the 'tongues as of fire'
a manifestation of God's presence in the Spirit, but that presence
causes the people to 'prophesy' (as Acts 2:17--18 later makes clear).
And the location from which God's Spirit descends at Pentecost must not
be only generally 'from heaven' but from the heavenly holy of holies or
temple, particularly when seen in the light of the descriptions in the
Sinai theophany, Isaiah 5 and 30, and the later possible developments of
these images in []{#chap6.html#page_208}*1 Enoch* 14 and 71, and Qumran.
Thus, all of these passages together collectively contribute from
various vantage points to a picture that resembles something like God's
heavenly temple descending upon his people and making them a part of it.

Two texts, both in Revelation, paint a picture similar to Pentecost,
although they do not contain the phrase 'tongues of fire'. Revelation
4:5 pictures 'seven lamps of fire burning before the throne', which is
interpreted to be 'the seven spirits of God' (i.e., the Spirit of God).
This vision occurs within an overall scene of the heavenly temple where
God sits on his
throne.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN384){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN384-1 .apnf} The
'lamps of fire' themselves are conceived of as burning on the temple
lampstands, which Revelation has already identified as the
churches.[21](#appen11.html#NFIN385){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN385-1 .apnf}
This is probably John's way of portraying the similar reality of
Pentecost: the divine Spirit from the heavenly temple has descended and
rested on God's people who become part of the heavenly temple on earth;
that is, the lampstands. Revelation 11:3--5 even says that the purpose
of the church becoming lampstands on earth is that they would 'stand
before the Lord of the earth' and be 'witnesses' who 'will prophesy',
and their prophetic utterance is portrayed as 'fire proceeding out of
their mouth'! This is surprisingly close to Acts 2, where the Spirit
from the heavenly temple descends in fire and rests upon God's people in
order that they be empowered to 'witness' (Acts 1:8; 2:40) and
'prophesy' (Acts 2:17--18).

What would appear to be the building of the new spiritual temple at
Pentecost included symbolic representatives of all the nations because
this temple will not fail to fulfil the intention of Eden's and Israel's
temples to expand its borders until the entire earth comes under its
roof.

### Pentecost as a fulfilment of John the Baptist's prophecy of the Spirit {.int_niv2}

Matthew 3:11 records John the Baptist proclaiming that while he
'baptizes in water', one will come after him who 'will baptize you with
the Holy Spirit and fire'. Then he baptizes Jesus, after which 'the
heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove
and coming upon him' (Matt. 3:16). This was Jesus' individual
[]{#chap6.html#page_209}Pentecost, whereby the Spirit empowered him for
his prophetic ministry. The same pattern for the latter corporate
Pentecost occurs for the same purpose of prophetic empowerment. We can
assume that at Pentecost the 'heavens were opened' as the Spirit
descended in fire in fulfilment of Matthew 3:11.

Judaism employed the same language as Matthew 3:16 in its expectation of
a priestly Messiah: 'the heavens will be opened, and *from the temple of
glory* sanctification will come upon him . . . And the spirit of
understanding . . . shall rest upon him \[in the water\]' (*Testament of
Levi* 18:6--7). The source of the Spirit in Matthew 3 may likewise be
the heavenly temple. The implicit association of the heavenly sanctuary
with Jesus' reception of the Spirit in Matthew 3 is perhaps not
coincidental in the light of our argument that the Spirit at Pentecost
also descended from the heavenly holy of holies.
:::

::: {#chap6.html#niv2-067 .niv2}
### Pentecost as a fulfilment of Joel's prophecy of the Spirit {.int_niv2}

Peter explains the theophanic episode of tongues in Acts 2:1--12 to be
an initial fulfilment of Joel's prophecy that God would 'pour out' his
'Spirit upon all flesh' and all classes of people in the covenant
community would 'prophesy' (Joel 2:28--29). At the beginning of the Joel
2:28 quotation, Peter substitutes the phrase 'in the latter days' (*en
tais eschatais hēmerais*) in place of Joel's 'after these things' (*meta
tauta*). The substitution comes from Isaiah 2:2 (on which, see Pao 2000:
156--159): 'In the last days,/The mountain of the house of the Lord/Will
be established as the chief of the mountains/And will be raised above
the hills;/And all the nations will stream to it.' Thus, Peter appears
to interpret the Spirit's coming in fulfilment of Joel to be also the
beginning fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy of the end-time temple, under
the influence of which the nations would come, as we will see the book
of Acts narrates.

In the Mosaic era, only prophets, priests and kings were bestowed with
the gifting function of the Spirit to serve usually in the temple (i.e.,
priests) or in conjunction with the temple (i.e., kings and prophets).
Joel and Acts do not have in mind primarily the regenerating function of
the Spirit but that function which would enable people to serve in
various capacities. Joel foresaw a time, however, when everyone in
Israel would be given this gift. That Joel 2 and Acts may have in mind
gifting for service in the new temple is apparent from recognizing that
Joel's prophecy is also developing the earlier text of
Numbers 11.[22](#appen11.html#NFIN386){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN386-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap6.html#page_210}Moses desires that God give him help to 'bear
the burden of the people' he was leading (Num. 11:11, 17; Exod.
18:13--27). God responds by telling Moses to gather 'seventy men from
the elders' and to 'bring them to *the tent of meeting*, and let them
take their stand there with you. Then I will come down and . . . will
take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them'
(11:16--17). Moses obeys God: 'he gathered seventy men of the elders . .
. and stationed them *around the tent*. Then the L[ORD]{.small} came
down in the cloud . . . and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and
placed Him upon the seventy elders. And it came about when the Spirit
rested upon them, they prophesied . . .' (11:24--25). They then stopped
prophesying, but two elders at another location continued to prophesy.
When Joshua reports this development to Moses, demanding that he stop
them, Moses declines to do so, replying: 'Would that all the
L[ORD]{.small}'s people were prophets, that the L[ORD]{.small} would put
His Spirit upon them' (11:26--29).

Accordingly, Joel 2 transforms Moses' prophetic wish into a formal
prophecy. Peter quotes Joel's prophecy to show that in his day it was
finally being fulfilled in Pentecost. The Spirit's gifts, formerly
limited to prophets, kings and priests, usually for service in
connection with the temple, are universalized to all of God's people
from every race, young and old, male and female. That the Spirit's
gifting in Acts 2 was for service in relation to the temple is intimated
by Numbers 11, which notes twice that the 'seventy elders' received the
Spirit as they were gathered around the 'tent' (i.e., the tabernacle).
In fact, that 'tongues of fire . . . rested on each one' and 'they were
all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues'
(explained to be 'prophesying' in 2:17--18) may be an allusion to
Numbers 11:25: 'when the Spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied'.[23](#appen11.html#NFIN387){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN387-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, Numbers 11:25 says that God 'took of the Spirit who was
upon him \[Moses\] and placed Him upon the seventy elders'. Likewise,
Acts 2:33 refers to Jesus as first 'having received from the Father the
promise of the Holy Spirit' and then having 'poured forth' the Spirit
upon those at Pentecost. In this respect, Jesus may be a second Moses
figure.

Even the prophesying of the 'seventy' in Numbers 11 has links with
[]{#chap6.html#page_211}the people prophesying in Acts 2. We have seen
that the list of nations represented at Pentecost (Acts 2:9--11) are an
abbreviated allusion to the seventy nations of the earth in Genesis 10,
and that the Acts narrative is a further development of Luke's earlier
narration of Jesus' sending of the 'seventy' to symbolize a beginning
witness to the world (Luke 10:1--12). Thus the links between the seventy
nations represented in Acts 2 and the 'seventy' of Numbers 11 may not be
coincidental.

The manner in which God's presence comes to fill the tabernacle, temple
and church enhances the plausibility that Luke is describing Pentecost
as the temple for this new age. When Moses finished constructing the
tabernacle, 'the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the
L[ORD]{.small} filled the tabernacle' (Exod.
40:34),[24](#appen11.html#NFIN388){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN388-1 .apnf} and
when Solomon finished building his temple, '*the cloud filled the house
of the LORD . . .* \[and\] the glory of the L[ORD]{.small} *filled the
house of the LORD*' (1 Kgs. 8:6--13). In the light of what we have said
so far about Acts 2 narrating an inauguration of a new heavenly temple
on earth, Acts 2:2--3 may include the Exodus 40 and 1 Kings texts in its
quarry of Old Testament allusions: 'there came from heaven a noise like
a violent, rushing wind, and *it filled the whole house . . .* and there
appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves . .
.'[25](#appen11.html#NFIN389){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN389-1 .apnf} The
Solomonic episode is particularly interesting, since the parallel in 2
Chronicles 7:1 describes the theophany as, '*fire came down from heaven
. . .* and the glory of the L[ORD]{.small} filled the house . . . and
they gave . . . praise to the L[ORD]{.small}'. Both texts also conclude
with a response of praise by the onlookers (2 Chr. 7:3, 'they gave . . .
praise to the L[ORD]{.small}'; cf. Acts 2:11, 'we hear them speaking . .
. of the mighty deeds of God').

One additional item of relevance is the last part of the Joel 2
quotation in Acts 2:19--21:

::: stroplg
And I will grant wonders in the sky above,

And signs on the earth beneath,

Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.

The sun shall be turned into darkness,

And the moon into blood,

Before the great and glorious day of the L[ORD]{.small} shall come.

And it shall be, that everyone who calls on the name of the
L[ORD]{.small} shall be saved.
:::

[]{#chap6.html#page_212}Some commentators view this part of the
quotation not to have begun fulfilment at Pentecost but still yet to
occur at the very end of history. Nevertheless, the language probably
indicates that even this part of the prophecy started fulfilment, since
Peter says 'this' (i.e., the preceding events of Pentecost in
Acts 2:1--13) 'is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel' (2:16).
Thus, the entire quotation should be understood as inaugurated at
Pentecost. If not, then the burden of proof otherwise must be
provided.[26](#appen11.html#NFIN390){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN390-1 .apnf}

That this last segment of the quotation is equally applicable to the
events of Pentecost as that of the first part is apparent by observing
that the very last line of the Joel quotation in Acts 2:21 ('everyone
who calls on the name of the L[ORD]{.small} shall be saved') is likely a
description of those who began to be 'saved' at Pentecost (Peter says
'be saved' \[2:40\] and a significant group responded: 'the Lord was
adding to their number day by day those who were being saved' \[2:47\]).
Also, the concluding phrase of Acts 2:39 ('as many as the Lord our God
shall call to Himself') is based on the very last phrase of Joel 2:32
('Even among the survivors *whom the LORD calls*') which Peter stops
short of quoting in Acts 2:21. This allusion to Joel in Acts 2:39 shows
that the end of that prophecy did, indeed, begin at Pentecost. Finally,
the allusion to Joel's 'wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth
beneath' together with 'fire' (Acts 2:19) plausibly describes in part
the 'noise like a violent, rushing wind' that came 'from heaven' and the
'tongues of fire' (Acts 2:2--3).

### Pentecost as a fulfilment of Joel's prophecy of the destruction of the old world and emergence of a new order {.int_niv2}

One further observation about the concluding part of Joel's prophecy is
that it is stock-in-trade Old Testament cosmic dissolution language. The
portrayal in Joel is part of a group of similar texts: Isaiah 13:10--13;
24:1--6, 19--23; 34:4; Ezekiel 32:6--8; Joel 2:10; 2:30--31; 3:15--16;
and Habakkuk 3:6--11 (possibly also Amos 8:8--9; Jer. 4:23--28; and Ps.
68:7--8). The same Old Testament texts are also influential for the
portrayals of Matthew 24:29 and Mark 13:24--25, which themselves
likewise formed a part of the apocalyptic quarry of passages influencing
the dramatic portrayal of Revelation
6:12--14.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN391){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN391-1 .apnf} All
of these references include at least four of the following elements
found in Joel 2 and Acts 2: the shaking of the earth (including
[]{#chap6.html#page_213}mountains), the darkening or shaking of the
moon, stars, sun and heaven, and the pouring out of blood.

The language of these passages describes the destruction of the cosmos.
Typically, the language is figurative to refer to the historical end of
a sinful nation's existence through divine judgment and the emerging
dominance of a victorious kingdom. God executes the judgment by
employing one nation to defeat another in war. Though the tone of
judgment is dominant, sometimes there is a positive aspect resulting in
the deliverance or refinement of a faithful remnant (especially when
Israel is the object of the judgment). Such figurative language occurred
because prophets had a literal conception of the end of history, and
they applied this metaphorically to the ends of various epochs or
kingdoms during the Old Testament
era.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN392){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN392-1 .apnf}

The uses of these same Old Testament passages in Matthew 24:29 and Mark
13:24--25 may also be figurative to indicate the end of Israel, since
some of the Old Testament portrayals also indicated the same figurative
end (Is. 2:19--21; 5:25; Jer. 4:23--28; Amos 8:7--10). Just as Babylon
had earlier destroyed Israel, so Rome would do so
again.[29](#appen11.html#NFIN393){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN393-1 .apnf} For
example, Jeremiah 4:23--28 describes Israel's destruction by Babylon to
be comparable to the earth becoming 'formless and void', to the heavens
having 'no light' and being 'dark', and to the 'mountains . . .
quaking'. It would be a 'cloudy and gloomy day' when Israel would suffer
defeat (Ezek. 34:12) because God would 'make the sun go down at noon and
make the earth dark in broad daylight' (Amos 8:9; cf. Jer. 15:9). Even
when these texts are predominantly figurative, likely included is a
literal notion of a person being destroyed,
[]{#chap6.html#page_214}whereby for such people the lights of the cosmos
can no longer be seen (on which, e.g., see Eccles. 12:1--2). These
destructive ends of earthly kingdoms were microcosmic examples of and
pointers to the macrocosmic end.

Consequently, Peter probably understands the language of Joel 2:30--31
to have begun fulfilment figuratively at Pentecost, though part of it
could literally depict the theophany described in Acts 2:2--3. If the
Old Testament usage of this kind of language is determinative for Peter,
then here also the wording connotes the end of one kingdom and the
emergence of another. The kingdom ending is, of course, Israel, but this
time it is her definitive end. Rome would destroy Jerusalem and her
temple in [AD]{.small} 70. Joel's language of the earth's destruction in
Acts 2 is also appropriate as a figurative portrayal of the temple's
destruction, since, as we have seen so often earlier, the temple itself
and its parts symbolized the
cosmos*.*[30](#appen11.html#NFIN394){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN394-1 .apnf} We
observed that when the temple veil, with embroidered work of the starry
heavens, was torn, it was symbolic of the beginning destruction of the
old creation. Acts 2 may continue a similar symbolic portrayal of
destruction of the old temple, but also appears to depict believers as
part of the new, descending and emerging temple because they are
identified with the resurrected Christ. If they are part of the new
temple, then they are part of the new creation, since the two notions
are synonymous, as our Old Testament analysis in chapter 2 has
demonstrated.

The destruction of Israel and her temple, however, was the mere outward
expression of the judgment that had already taken place at Christ's
death, resurrection and at Pentecost. Israel's rejection of Jesus sealed
their fate as a nation (as elaborated already in Matt. 23:29--38). What
underscores the picture in Joel 2:30--31 as figurative for Israel's
final demise is the observation that the very same language was used
earlier in Joel 2:10b to signify clearly the imminent destruction of
Israel in the Old Testament epoch itself ('the sun and the moon grow
dark'; cf. the full cosmic conflagration imagery in Joel 2:1--5, 10a,
c). Rather than saying that the Joel language is used symbolically in
Acts 2, it may be better to say that it indicates the real beginning
destruction of the old world, represented by Israel and her temple,
which begins in the spiritual realm. That is, unbelieving Israel and the
temple were judged to be spiritually condemned at the time
[]{#chap6.html#page_215}of Jesus (e.g., Matt. 23:29--39) and Pentecost,
and a generation later the destruction of her temple occurred as an
expression of the earlier spiritual judgment. The consummated fulfilment
of Joel 2 will express itself in the destruction of the entire physical
cosmos, which the temple symbolized.

The same expression found in Joel 2:10 occurs again in Joel 3:15a ('The
sun and moon grow dark') that likewise probably refers to the same
reality as in Joel 2:30--31. There the appearance of the Lord comes from
'Zion', the 'holy mountain', and 'the house of the
L[ORD]{.small}'[31](#appen11.html#NFIN395){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN395-1
.apnf} (Joel 3:16--18). Joel 3 clarifies what Joel 2 may already have
implied twice about the origin of revelatory cosmic destruction, since
there it occurs in connection with 'Zion . . . my holy mountain' (cf.
2:1--11; likewise, 2:31--32). Again, we have one more indication that
theophanic revelation connected with Joel 2:30--31 comes from the
heavenly temple, suggesting further that the theophany in Acts 2 also
comes from the heavenly sanctuary.

Joel 2:30--32 also indicates that not only judgment but blessing results
from the theophanic revelation. As we have seen, the cosmic destruction
language means that judgment comes, but also often that a faithful
remnant survives the judgment. Joel 2:32 says that 'whoever calls on the
name of the L[ORD]{.small} will be delivered . . . There will be those
who escape . . . even among the survivors whom the L[ORD]{.small}
calls.' And, as we have seen, some in Acts 2 respond in faith in Christ
and are 'saved'. This faithful remnant is the beginning of the new
people of God, the continuation of true Israel, and, what we have
argued, the initial corporate form of the new spiritual temple. On the
other hand, the phenomenon of 'tongues', though a sign of blessing (as
we have seen), is also a harbinger of judgment, as is the cosmic
conflagration language of Joel. The association of judgment is apparent
from 1 Corinthians 14:21--25, which asserts that uninterpreted tongues
are a sign of judgment, as Isaiah 28:9--13 makes clear. The Isaiah text
says that the 'tongues' of foreigners (i.e., the Assyrians) being heard
in Israel would indicate that judgment on the nation was commencing, as
the foreigners were invading to desolate the
nation.[32](#appen11.html#NFIN396){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN396-1 .apnf}
Likewise, the same sign of judgment is apparent with the tongues at
Pentecost, though this time it indicates Israel's definitive destruction
together with her temple. The voices Israel hears are not those of
Assyrian []{#chap6.html#page_216}soldiers preparing to destroy their
land, but Galileans (Acts 2:7) proclaiming that the establishment of a
new temple had begun.

## Christ as the cornerstone of the new temple {.int_niv1}

Acts 4:11 is the most direct identification of Christ as the beginning
of the new temple in the entire book of Acts: Christ is 'the stone which
was rejected by you, the builders, which became the very cornerstone'.
As we have noted earlier in our discussion of Matthew 21:42 and Mark
12:10, this wording is an allusion to Psalm 118, which in its original
context and in the synoptics refers to the chief stone of the temple.
Christ is now the cornerstone of the true temple. Acts 4:10 identifies
Christ's death as the epitome of him being 'the stone which was
rejected' and his resurrection as him becoming 'the chief cornerstone'.
Just a few verses earlier, Luke has identified Jesus' resurrection with
the beginning fulfilment of the 'blessing' promised to the 'fathers' by
quoting Genesis 22:18: God says, 'to Abraham, "And in your seed all the
families of the earth shall be blessed"' (Acts 3:25--26 citing Gen.
22:18). We have seen earlier the combination of the Adamic-- patriarchal
promise with temple building throughout Genesis, of which Genesis 22 was
one of the main examples. That we find the combination again in
connection with Christ is natural, since he is the commencement of the
true fulfilment of that repeated promise.

## Christ as the emerging new temple: Stephen's testimony {.int_niv1}

The next significant mention of the temple is in Acts 6:13--14, where
the Jews bring Stephen into the court of the 'Sanhedrin', and witnesses
testify that he spoke 'against this holy place . . . for we have heard
him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the
customs which Moses handed down to us'.

### Stephen's defence of Christ as the true temple in contrast to the old temple {.int_niv2}

Stephen begins his defence by appealing to God's appearance to Abraham,
including that in Genesis 12:7a: God 'promised that He would give it
\[the land\] to him as a possession, and to his seed after him'
(Acts 7:5; see also Gen. 17:8). This was part of the Adamic commission
that was reissued to Abraham in Genesis 12:1--3. Genesis 12:7 is also
the first occurrence of small-scale sanctuary building by
[]{#chap6.html#page_217}the patriarchs in combination with the Adamic
promissory commission! Genesis 12:7b concludes with, 'So he \[Abraham\]
built an altar there to the L[ORD]{.small} who had appeared to him.'
Thus, the promise to Abraham was that his seed would eventually extend
the work of his own sanctuary-building activity.

But how does the introductory discussion of Abraham (Acts 7:1--7) relate
to the conclusion about the rejection of Israel's temple
(Acts 7:48--50)? In this respect the work of John Kilgallen on Acts 7 is
helpful, for he asserts that Stephen mentions Abraham because he
believed God's promise to the patriarch was essentially about the
temple! Kilgallen observes that Stephen's concern about Abraham in
relation to the tabernacle is apparent from the goal of the exodus and
of God's promise of giving the land to Abraham's seed noted in Acts 7:7:
Abraham's seed 'will come out \[of Egypt\] and *worship* Me in this
place'! Indeed, 'worship of God in the Temple was the final reason why
Abraham (and through him the Israelite nation) was ever called at all.
In short, this worship was to be the fundamental reason for, and the
essential quality of, the very nation itself' (Kilgallen 1976: 94). The
role then of Abraham in Stephen's speech is to demonstrate 'that the
temple, where Israel works out its national purpose, is a contradiction
of that very nature and purpose' (1976: 94) because of its idolatry and
disobedience.

After Abraham, Stephen summarizes Israel's rejection of Joseph and
Moses. Israel was rebellious towards God not only during Egyptian
captivity, but they became idolatrous during their wilderness sojourn.
The establishment of the tabernacle and its entrance into the promised
land led to David's desire to make God's dwelling in Israel permanent.
This found fruition in Solomon's building of the temple. Thus the
statement that 'Solomon . . . built a house for Him' is the conclusion
and climax of Stephen's historical narration (Acts 7:47).

In response to the climax of Solomon's building a temple for God,
Stephen says, 'however, the Most High does not dwell in handmade
things', and in support he quotes Isaiah 66:1--2: 'Heaven is My throne,
and the earth is My footstool./Where then is a house that you could
build for Me?/And where is a place that I may rest?/For My hand made all
these things . . .' The reference to Isaiah indicates that Stephen did
not believe that Solomon's building of the temple was a sufficient
fulfilment of the divine promise that a son of David would build God a
temple (as announced in 2 Sam. 7:12--13,
26).[33](#appen11.html#NFIN397){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN397-1 .apnf} This is,
[]{#chap6.html#page_218}of course, a natural corollary to the even more
obvious assumption of Acts 2:29--33 that Solomon was not the ultimate
fulfilment of the promise that God 'will raise up' David's 'seed . . .
who will come forth', and God 'will establish his kingdom' (2 Sam.
7:12).

Christ was the long-range fulfilment of this promise to David.
Acts 13:22--36 will repeat this affirmation from Acts 2 (cf. Acts 13:23,
'From the seed of this man \[David\] according to promise God has
brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus.' This same notion has been
anticipated by Luke 1:32--33 (in partial allusion to 2 Sam. 7:12--16).
Christ is the one who began to build the true temple composed of himself
and his people.[34](#appen11.html#NFIN398){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN398-1
.apnf} Christ likewise fulfils Zechariah 6:12--13, which repeats that
the messianic 'branch . . . will build the temple of the
L[ORD]{.small}', and then says he 'will . . . rule on His throne' and
'be a priest'.[35](#appen11.html#NFIN399){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN399-1
.apnf}

The purpose of Acts 7:46--52 is to conclude that 'as *Moses* was
rejected and the people's worship became blasphemous thereby
\[7:20--43\], so with *Christ* rejected, the *Temple worship* becomes a
blasphemy' (Kilgallen 1976: 94). But there is more. Discernible in these
verses also is the hope of a new temple that has arisen in place of the
old.

### Stephen's appeal to Isaiah 66 in defence of Christ as the true temple {.int_niv2}

The broader context of Isaiah needs some study in order to understand
Stephen's use of Isaiah 66:1--2
better.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN400){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN400-1 .apnf}
Isaiah 63:15 reinforces the notion that God's present true temple is
only in heaven: 'Look down from heaven, and see from your *lofty
dwelling place* of holiness and glory' (i.e., the temple in heaven)
(Koehler and Baumgartner 1994: 263). The holy of holies represented the
invisible, heavenly temple and throne of God (= Is. 66:1a), and it was
the actual place where this heavenly dimension extended down to earth.
In Isaiah's language, it was God's 'footstool', which precisely referred
to the ark of the
covenant.[37](#appen11.html#NFIN401){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN401-1 .apnf} The
desire that God's heavenly temple would come
[]{#chap6.html#page_219}down and spread throughout the earth may be
expressed in Isaiah 64:1--2 (esp. in the light of 63:15): 'O that Thou
wouldst rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake
at Thy presence \[cf. Exod. 19:18\] . . . to make Thy name known to Thy
adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Thy presence.' This is a
plea for a new descent of God's presence, on analogy with his revelation
at Sinai and in the tabernacle at the first Exodus, to accomplish
finally the divine intentions inherent in that first Exodus (so Kissane
1943: 299). The primary divine intention was that God's glorious
presence would not be limited to the tabernacle (and to Moses), but be
extended to all of God's true people (cf. Num. 11:24--30 discussed
earlier).

We have seen that Pentecost was a Sinai-like theophany of a descending
heavenly temple. Thus, the latter-day Siniatic theophany prophesied by
Isaiah began fulfilment at Pentecost. The universal goal of this
revelation may be alluded to in Isaiah 66:18--21, where God will make
Gentiles into 'priests' and 'Levites' (so, e.g., Young 1996: 535) who
will serve in the new, expanded temple. Likewise, a similar prophecy
that foreigners will be priests in the temple appears in Isaiah 56:3--8.

Therefore, the future-oriented, redemptive-historical 'new Exodus'
context of Isaiah 63 -- 66 (indeed, of Is. 40 -- 66) points strongly to
Isaiah 66:1 not merely as a reference to the *entire present* cosmos
being God's temple in which he dwells (*pace* Levenson 1984: 296), but
that there will be a future new cosmos and temple that God will create
and in which he will dwell for ever, which will be an extension of the
present *heavenly* temple.

Stephen's speech in Acts 7 further supports this line of thought. Not
coincidentally, he quotes Isaiah 66:1 (in Acts 7:49) as part of the
climax of his answer to the charge that he had spoken 'against this holy
place, and the Law' by saying that 'Jesus will destroy this place and
alter the customs which Moses handed down . . .' (Acts 6:13--14). This
itself is an allusion to the charge against Jesus in Mark 14:58: 'We
heard Him say, "I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three
days I will build another made without hands."' Hence, Stephen's
comments relate to Jesus' building of the eschatological temple that
began with his earthly ministry and especially his resurrection (so John
2:19--22).[38](#appen11.html#NFIN402){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN402-1 .apnf}

Stephen catches a glimpse of the new heavenly temple directly
[]{#chap6.html#page_220}before he is stoned: 'he gazed intently into
heaven and saw *the glory of God . . .* and he said, "Behold, I see *the
heavens opened up* and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of
God"' (Acts 7:55--56). In view of our above discussion about Isaiah 63,
perhaps the prophet's plea from Isaiah 64:1 is answered for Stephen: 'if
you would open the heaven' (so [LXX]{.small}), which we saw in Isaiah
referred to the heavenly temple. Elsewhere in the Bible, the expression
'heavens were opened' together with the mention of the 'glory' of God
always introduces a vision of the heavenly temple where the 'glory' of
God abides.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN403){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN403-1 .apnf}

Our earlier discussion of Isaiah 57 and 66 may be relevant here (see
pp. 135--137). We saw that Isaiah 66:1--2 appears to develop 57:15:

\[being\] opened'. It is part of an eschatological prophecy about the
temple (developing 56:3--8). Apparently, God will come from his heavenly
sanctuary and extend it to encompass humble saints. Isaiah 66:1--2 is
not some general theological or Platonic statement detached from
redemptive history, but it develops 57:15. In the time to come, God will
cause his heavenly temple to descend and will include 'the afflicted and
smitten'.[41](#appen11.html#NFIN405){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN405-1 .apnf}

Isaiah 66:2 gives two reasons for the implied negative answer to the
question of Isaiah 66:1: (1) no part of the creation can adequately
house God, especially an old, sin-affected creation (Is. 66:2a); (2) in
light of Isaiah 57, God will dwell only in a new creation by extending
his heavenly temple to it and extend it by making multitudes of the
'afflicted and humble' participate in it through 'making them alive'
(Is. 66:2b). As Stephen was being 'afflicted and smitten', he was
beginning to experience the latter-day tabernacling presence of God
expressed in Isaiah 57 and 66 in his midst. Perhaps, neither he nor Luke
quotes the last part of Isaiah 66:2, because his experience in
Acts 7:54--60 is the fulfilment of it!

Thus, not only Acts 7 but Acts 2 and 4 are better understood against the
background of the later chapters of Isaiah. Levenson has shown (see
pp. 25, 141, above) that the new creation and Jerusalem in Isaiah
65:17--19 are likely equivalent to the new temple. His conclusion is
pointed to further by Isaiah 66:21--23, where the coming 'new heavens
and the new earth' (v. 22) are given as the reason that God will 'take'
Gentiles 'for priests and for Levites' (v. 21). In other words, the
reason that Gentiles will be included as priests is because now the
place of true worship and temple service is not geographically located
in a man-made temple in the old, temporal Jerusalem, but in the entire
new, eternal earth, where 'all mankind will come to bow down before Me'
for ever (v. 23, which is part of the point in John 4:20--24).

[]{#chap6.html#page_222}It is passages such as Isaiah 57:15 and 66:1--24
that lie behind the beginning democratization of the Spirit in Acts 2,
remembering that the recipients of the Spirit at Pentecost represented
the people groups of the known earth. Though those first baptized with
the Spirit in fulfilment of Joel 2 were Palestinian and Diaspora Jews,
as well as Gentile proselytes, the Spirit's gifting work later enveloped
Samaritans (Acts 8:14--17) and other Gentiles (Acts 10:44--48; 19:1--7).
It is important to recognize that Joel 2:28--32 was a prophecy of the
pouring out of the Spirit *on all in Israel*, which the pronouns ('you,
your') in Joel 2:28--32 demonstrate, since they are referring to the
same pronouns used for Israel in Joel 2:18--27. This suggests that,
based on Peter's identification of Pentecost as fulfilling Joel
2:28--32, not only ethnic Jewish Christians but also Gentile Christians
are the beginning fulfilment of Spirit-filled latter-day Israel. The
reason that both are identified as end-time Israel is because of their
identification with and representation by Jesus Christ, the true Israel
and representative of the remnant prophesied by Joel 2:32. He was, after
all, the epitome of the first 'Spirit-filled' Israelite who initially
fulfilled the Joel prophecy, since he received the end-time Spirit
before anyone else and then passed him on to his followers (so
Acts 2:33; as well as Matt. 3:16 and parallels).

### Stephen's contention that God's eternal end-time temple cannot be 'handmade' {.int_niv2}

Stephen's appeal to Isaiah 66:1 is also appropriate, since that Old
Testament passage itself appears to be an allusion to 1 Kings 8:27,
where at the dedication of the temple, Solomon proclaims, 'heaven and
the highest heaven cannot contain Thee, how much less this house which I
have built'. This verse probably provided part of the transition from
speaking about Solomon building the temple in Acts 7:47--48 to the
quotation of Isaiah 66:1 in Acts 7:49--50. From the inception of the
temple there was an unsolved paradox of God's simultaneous inability and
ability to live within an earthly temple. Stephen's narrative explains
that this paradox is resolved by realizing that Solomon's temple was a
mere pointer to a time when God's dwelling on earth would not be limited
to a 'handmade' house. Israel's physical temples were 'handmade'
(Acts 7:44--47) and could never be a permanent dwelling place for God.
Stephen's point in citing Isaiah 66:1 is to demonstrate that, just as
God's own hand created the first cosmos that had become tainted with
idolatry (cf. Acts 7:44--47 with 7:41--43 in contrast to 7:50), so God
would create []{#chap6.html#page_223}a new, eternal creation and
Jerusalem, not by human hands but by his own hand (so Is. 65:17--19 and
66:22). This is why even Solomon's temple was not the ultimate
fulfilment of the promise that David's son would build God a temple --
because Solomon's temple was 'handmade'.

Isaiah 66:3--6 makes clearer that Isaiah's (and Stephen's) point is
about the inadequacy of human temples *both* because of God's
transcendence and their inherent association with sin. The disjunction
between the old idolatrous world and God's coming new world and temple
is underscored by contrasting his 'humble and contrite' people (66:2)
who will dwell in the future temple with those who prefer to dwell with
idols (66:3--5). These idolaters profess faith but hate the true people
of God, and they will be judged by God from his heavenly temple
(66:5--6). All idolatry must be removed before the new creation is
ushered in. It appears that Acts 7:51--52 echoes Isaiah 66:4--5: Stephen
calls the unrepentant Jews those who are 'uncircumcised in heart and
ears \[and\] . . . always resisting the Holy Spirit' and who have become
'persecutors' like their fathers of God's true 'prophets' (especially of
Jesus). Likewise, Isaiah refers to Israelites who 'did not listen' when
'God called'[42](#appen11.html#NFIN406){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN406-1 .apnf}
and who professed covenant loyalty but who 'hated' and 'exclude' the
true people of God. If Isaiah 66:4--5 is echoed, then Stephen's Jewish
enemies are also to be identified with the idolaters in Isaiah 66:3,
which would fit with Stephen's earlier depiction of Israel as idolatrous
(Acts 7:42--43) and his identification of the present generation with
their sinful fathers (7:52).

Stephen's terminology is in line with the rest of the New Testament,
where 'handmade' refers to the old creation and 'made without hands'
refers to the new creation, most specifically to the resurrection state
as the beginning of the new creation. The clearest expression of this is
in Mark 14:58. The narrative of Stephen's speech is launched (6:14) on
the basis of this saying, which later came to be written down in Mark's
Gospel: 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and *in three days
I will build* another made without hands.' Likewise, Hebrews 9:11 refers
to the resurrected Christ entering into the 'tabernacle, not made with
hands, that is to say, not of this creation' but of the new creation;
virtually identically Hebrews 9:24 asserts, 'Christ did not enter a holy
place made with hands'. In Acts []{#chap6.html#page_224}17 Paul cites
the ultimate contrast being between idols that 'dwell in temples made
with hands' (17:24) and Christ who was 'raised . . . from the dead'
(17:31). The believer who is identified with Christ also begins to exist
in the new creation state: 'we have a building from God, a house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens' (2 Cor. 5:1).

The only other New Testament use of this terminology occurs in Ephesians
and Colossians, where unbelieving Jews are referred to as the
'circumcision made by hand', in contrast to being God's 'workmanship,
created in \[the resurrected\] Christ Jesus' (Eph. 2:10--11; cf. 2:5--6,
15). Conversely, believers have been 'circumcised with a circumcision
made without hands . . . by the circumcision of Christ; having been
buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him
through faith . . .'
(Col. 2:11--12).[43](#appen11.html#NFIN407){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN407-1
.apnf} This distinction finds further confirmation from Daniel's stone
'cut out without hands' (Dan. 2:34, 45) and the *Epistle of Barnabas*
16, which contrasts people in the old creation as an old 'temple built
by human hands' with those who have become 'new, created again' through
God's powerful dwelling
presence[44](#appen11.html#NFIN408){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN408-1 .apnf} (on
both Daniel and *Barnabas* see further below).

The latter part of Stephen's speech served to criticize those who did
not even perceive the paradox of God's simultaneous inability and
ability to exist in an earthly temple. Such people believed that God's
earthly dwelling was restricted to the temple in Jerusalem. This
onesided perspective was, in fact, idolatry. The word 'handmade'
(Acts 7:48) always refers to idols in the Greek Old Testament and is
without exception a negative reference in the New
Testament.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN409){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN409-1 .apnf} In
fact, the []{#chap6.html#page_225}only other use in Acts refers to an
idolatrous pagan temple: 'the Lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in
temples made with hands'
(Acts 17:24)\![46](#appen11.html#NFIN410){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN410-1
.apnf} Further, Acts 19:26 uses a synonymous expression in quoting Paul
as 'saying that gods being manufactured with hands are no gods', which
includes a condemnation of small 'temples' (*naous*) for idols
(Acts 19:24). Stephen's reference to the idolatrous golden calf being
the result of 'the works of their hands' only a few verses earlier
(Acts 7:41) makes it probable that Stephen has idolatry in mind in verse
48 (Kilgallen 1976: 90).

As in the Old Testament uses of 'handmade', Stephen's use serves to
belittle that which is
idolatrous.[47](#appen11.html#NFIN411){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN411-1 .apnf}
This takes on significance when it is remembered that even the priests
'defiled' Solomon's temple with the idols of the nations (2 Chr. 36:14).
This notion is enhanced by a Jewish tradition that understood Isaiah
66:1 to be a response by Isaiah to King Manasseh's erecting of an idol
in the temple.[48](#appen11.html#NFIN412){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN412-1
.apnf} In addition to the fact that human-created structures inherently
could not serve as a permanent residence for God, when these structures
become defiled with 'handmade' idols, not only can God not live in them,
but they must eventually be destroyed (on which cf., e.g., 2 Kgs. 22:17;
Is. 2:5--22; Jer. 25:6--14; Mic.
5:13).[49](#appen11.html#NFIN413){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN413-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap6.html#page_226}We discovered earlier that the stone-mountain of
Daniel 2 and the prophesied eschatological temple are linked in that
both are not made by human hands. As we have also seen, the New
Testament repeatedly refers to the new, end-time temple as 'not made
with hands' (in addition to Acts 7:48, see Mark 14:58; 2 Cor. 5:1; Heb.
9:11, 24). The image in the Old Testament corresponding closest to this
is Daniel's stone 'cut out without hands' (Dan. 2:34, 45). We have
already found that it is not surprising that Christ identifies himself
with the stone of Daniel, the true temple (Luke 20:17--18 = Matt.
21:42). Accordingly, Paul affirms that 'The God who made the world and
all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell
in temples made with hands' (Acts 17:24). Paul says this after the great
redemptive-historical divide when Christ and his people had begun to
replace Israel's idolatrous 'handmade' temple. There could be no
humanmade structures separating God and his people in order that he
dwell fully and unfettered with them. This is why no human can answer
affirmatively God's question about his eschatological, eternal dwelling,
'Where then is a house you could build for Me?' (Is. 66:1).

Even before the early Christian evidence, Daniel's stone 'not cut by
human hands' (Dan. 2:34, 45) may have resonated with cultic implications
because the only other references to 'uncut stones' are in Exodus,
Deuteronomy and Joshua, where Israel was to build 'an altar of *uncut
stones* \[literally 'whole stones'\], on which no man had wielded an
iron tool', and 'they offered burnt offerings . . . and sacrificed peace
offerings' (so Josh. 8:31 in fulfilment of Exod.
20:25).[50](#appen11.html#NFIN414){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN414-1 .apnf}
Similarly, 1 Kings 6:7 says that Solomon's temple 'was built of stone
prepared at the quarry, and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any
iron tool heard in the house while it was being built'. This description
of the silence of human tools during the construction of Solomon's
temple may be a subtle pointer to the ultimate temple which would be
made completely without human hands.

The Daniel stone may also have represented a sacred antithesis of the
image that it smashed. The stone smashes the statue which is repeatedly
said to be made of 'gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay' (Dan.
2:31--45) and which symbolized the ungodly nations. The only other times
the same combination of four metals are listed together are in Daniel
5:4, 23, where they refer to Babylonian idols! We have argued directly
above and in an earlier chapter that the stone 'not cut by human hands'
is the beginning form of the new temple. If that
identifi[]{#chap6.html#page_227}cation is correct, then what we have in
Daniel 2 is the divine undefiled temple replacing the world-system's
impure worship of idols.

Interestingly, the *Sibylline Oracles*, a Jewish work (c. [AD]{.small}
80), affirms a similar notion, perhaps as a result of contemplating the
recent destruction of Jerusalem's temple in [AD]{.small} 70: 'the great
God, whom no hands of men fashioned . . . does not have a house, a stone
set up as a temple . . . but one which it is not possible to see from
the earth nor to measure with mortal eyes, since it was not fashioned by
mortal hand' (*Sibylline Oracles* 4:6--11). Consequently, God's true
people 'will reject all temples when they see them; altars too, useless
foundations of dumb stones' (*Sibylline Oracles* 4:27--28). Philo
likewise affirms the inability of created structures to house the divine
presence: 'What house shall be prepared for God . . . ? Shall it be of
stone or timber?' (*Cherub.* 100). Even pagans seemed to perceive this
truth: 'What house built by craftsmen could enclose the form divine
within enfolding walls?' (Euripides, *Fragment*
968).[51](#appen11.html#NFIN415){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN415-1 .apnf}

To sum up the point of this section so far, we may say that God's
intention is one day to fill every part of his creation with his
presence because he is the Creator. God's holy presence could not fully
dwell in human-made structures of the old creation both because of his
transcendence and because it was a sin-tainted world. Hence, his special
revelatory presence dwelt in a limited manner in human-made structures.
But when he fully redeems the world and recreates it (so Rom. 8:18--25),
he will fill the entire creation with his presence and dwell in it in a
fuller way than ever
before.[52](#appen11.html#NFIN416){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN416-1 .apnf}

As discussed earlier, we may assume that God created the cosmos to be
his great temple in which he rested after the creative work.
Nevertheless, his unique revelatory glory did not fill the entire earth
yet, since it was his intention that this goal be achieved by his human
vice-regent whom he installed in the garden sanctuary to extend the
cultic boundaries of God's presence worldwide. Adam, of course,
disobeyed this mandate, so humanity no longer enjoyed God's presence, as
they had in Eden. In addition, the entire earth became infected with sin
and idolatry in a way it had not been previously even during its still
imperfected, newly created state. Israel's failure not to expand
[]{#chap6.html#page_228}the borders of the temple and the light of God's
presence throughout the world (cf. Is. 42:6; 49:6) was a failure in
falling short in fulfilling the original divine intention of the temple,
and this disobedience became bound up with their idolatrous rebellion.
Therefore, in the light of Adam's and Israel's failures, the statements
about God's inability to dwell in any structure on earth plausibly
include reference to the old creation and temple, not only being tainted
with idolatry but also requiring divine purification and recreation.
Such a purgation would prepare the way for God's glorious presence,
formerly limited to heaven and the holy of holies, to dwell universally
throughout creation,[53](#appen11.html#NFIN417){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN417-1
.apnf} by means of a divinely made temple.

### Early Christian evidence confirming the above interpretation of Isaiah 66 in Stephen's speech {.int_niv2}

The *Epistle of Barnabas* also cites Isaiah 66:1 in connection with the
notion of 'handmade things' and gives an interpretation along the lines
given by Stephen, though even more explicitly:

::: cita
I will also speak to you about the temple, and how those wretched men
went astray and set their hope on the building, as though it were God's
house, and not on their God who created them. For they, almost like the
heathen, consecrated him by means of the temple. But what does the Lord
say in abolishing it? Learn! 'Who measured heaven with the span of his
hand, or the earth with his palm? \[Is. 40:12\] Was it not I, says the
Lord? Heaven is my throne, and the earth is a footstool for my feet.
What kind of house will you build for me, or what place for me to rest?'
\[Is. 66:1\] You now know that their hope was in vain. Furthermore,
again he says: 'Behold, those who tore down this temple will build it
themselves'. This is happening now. (*Barnabas* 16:1--3)
:::

The author is explicit that Isaiah 66 indicates that Israel's old temple
had become idolatrous and had to be abolished. He even paraphrases
Jesus' own words 'destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it
up' (e.g., John 2:19) by interpreting it of the Gentiles who tore down
the temple in [AD]{.small} 70, and also are rebuilding the church in
[]{#chap6.html#page_229}Christ. It is likely this thought that leads
directly to the next section of the epistle:

::: cita
But let us inquire whether there is in fact a temple of God. There is --
where he himself says he is building and completing it! . . . I
discover, therefore, that there is in fact a temple. How, then will it
be built in the name of the Lord? Learn! Before we believed in God, our
heart's dwelling-place was corrupt and weak, truly a temple built by
human hands, because it was full of idolatry and was the home of demons,
for we did whatever was contrary to God. 'But it will be built in the
name of the Lord' . . . How? Learn! By receiving the forgiveness of sins
and setting our hope on the Name, we became new, created again from the
beginning. Consequently God truly dwells in our dwelling-place -- that
is, in us. How? The word of faith . . . opening to us who had been in
bondage to death the door of the temple . . . he leads us into the
incorruptible temple (*Barnabas* 16:6--9).
:::

After speaking of Israel's temple as idolatrous and doomed to
destruction, the passage asserts that those who are not truly God's
people are as idolatrous as (presumably) Israel's or any pagan 'temple
built by human hands', since they are unbelieving, disobedient, and a
part of the 'corrupt and weak' old creation. Such people may become part
of the new temple being built by God through believing in the Lord and
'receiving the forgiveness of sins'. Then they become 'created again'
and part of God's 'incorruptible temple'.

The *Barnabas* passage seems to be an expanded interpretation of
Acts 7:48--51, as the author even alludes to the 'destruction of the
temple' (*Barnabas* 16:2--3) in Acts 6:14. Barnabas does not develop so
much the idea that God's transcendence prohibits his dwelling in human
structures, but focuses on that part of Stephen's argument concerning
the old temple as an unfit place for God's dwelling because of its
idolatrous nature. If this epistle is not reflecting directly on Acts 7,
it is remarkably similar to its concepts and, especially, to that part
which disavows the continuing validity of the temple because of its
idolatrous taint. Barnabas too quotes Isaiah 66 to indicate that
Israel's temple had to be jettisoned because it was 'handmade' and had
become idolatrous and the people disobedient, and in its place Christ
and his people formed a new temple.

### []{#chap6.html#page_230}Paul's contention that a permanent temple for God's presence cannot be 'handmade' {.int_niv2}

Brief reference has been made above to Paul's speech in Athens, which is
relevant for further elaboration. Acts 17:24--25 explains that in the
present age people are not to fulfil the commission of Genesis by
building material temple structures and finding God there: 'The God who
made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and
earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; neither is He served
by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to
all life and breath and all things.'

Not only are man-made temples inadequate to house the divine presence
permanently (v. 24) but also such structures imply that God needs to be
'served by human hands'. This is an impossibility, since God is the
self-sufficient Creator of everything (v. 25). Furthermore, one would be
quite mistaken to think that God's presence is to be found behind idols
of 'gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of
man' (v. 29). The reason for this is that humans were created to be
God's sons (i.e., 'the offspring of God'). Just as children reflect the
image of their parents, so God's children should reflect him, which they
do by reflecting the glorious attributes of his 'divine nature' (cf.
Gen. 1:27) and not by not reflecting the unspiritual nature of handmade
idols. Paul's logic is simple: 'if like begets like, it is illogical to
suppose that the divine nature that created living human beings is like
an image made of an inanimate substance' (Larkin 1995: 259).

Acts 17:26--31 is a fitting summary of how humanity is to fulfil their
Adamic commission in a post-fall
world[54](#appen11.html#NFIN418){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN418-1 .apnf} in
relation to temple building (though here it is pagan temple construction
that is negatively assessed \[v. 24\] to make the point):

::: cita
and He made from one, every nation of mankind to live on all the face of
the earth, having determined their appointed times, and the boundaries
of their habitation, that they should seek God, if perhaps they might
grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us . .
. 'Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now
declaring to men that all everywhere should repent, because He has fixed
a []{#chap6.html#page_231}day in which He will judge the world in
righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished
proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.'
:::

Paul says that God has caused humanity to spread out (presumably from
Babel)[55](#appen11.html#NFIN419){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN419-1 .apnf} in
order 'that they should seek God', and that since the coming of Christ
they may 'seek' and 'find' him by repenting and trusting in the
resurrected Christ. If they do this, he will not judge them.

If 'all men everywhere should repent', then the Adamic commission would
finally be fulfilled. That the Genesis 1:28 commission is in the
background receives confirmation from noticing that Acts 17:25 alludes
to Genesis 1:29 and 2:7 (see Greek OT): 'I \[God\] have given to you
every seed-bearing herb' (Gen. 1:29), and God 'breathed upon his face
the breath of life'
(Gen. 2:7).[56](#appen11.html#NFIN420){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN420-1 .apnf}
Both of these Genesis passages are elaborations of Genesis 1:28.

The phrase 'For we also are his offspring' (Acts 17:28) is a quotation
from the Greek poet Aratus (*Phenomena* 5), the immediate context of
which is amazingly similar to the goal of Adam's commission, that God's
presence would fill the entire cosmos: 'all ways are full of Zeus and
all meeting-places of men; the sea and the harbours are full of him. In
every direction we all have to do with
Zeus.'[57](#appen11.html#NFIN421){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN421-1 .apnf} Paul
has taken a pagan affirmation about a false god and applied it to the
true God, whom it truly describes, and possibly to his original
universal
intentions.[58](#appen11.html#NFIN422){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN422-1 .apnf}
Thus, biblical writers often 'plunder the
Egyptians'[59](#appen11.html#NFIN423){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN423-1 .apnf} in
this manner.

It is thus remarkable to find the Acts 17 passage combining
[]{#chap6.html#page_232}allusions to the Genesis commission and to
temple themes, a combination we have found often elsewhere in the Old
Testament and Gospels. Also noteworthy in this regard is that this text
has unique connections with Acts 7:46--50 and 15:16--17, passages that
discuss Israel's outmoded temple and the eschatological
temple.[60](#appen11.html#NFIN424){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN424-1 .apnf}
Acts 17 then appears to develop further the theme of these earlier
passages. Though we have not yet directly addressed the Acts 15 passage,
we now turn our attention to it in the next section.

## Christ as the emerging new temple: James's testimony {.int_niv1}

Another possible reference to a new temple in Acts is the quotation of
Amos 9:11--12 in Acts 15:16--17: 'After these things I will return, and
I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen, and I will
rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, in order that the rest of
mankind may seek the L[ORD]{.small}, and all the Gentiles who are called
by My name.'[61](#appen11.html#NFIN425){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN425-1 .apnf}
Amos prophesied concerning what God would do after Israel's captivity,
when he would restore them. While this is a hope to rebuild Jerusalem,
it also pertains to the rebuilding of Israel's 'tabernacle' or temple.
James's quotation of Amos supports the earlier testimony of Peter, Paul
and Barnabas that Gentiles are 'saved through the grace of the Lord
Jesus' (v. 11) and by God 'cleansing their hearts by faith' (v. 9) and
not by the old Law (v. 10). Moreover, the 'signs and wonders . . . among
the Gentiles' (v. 12) were evidence that God was 'giving them the Holy
Spirit, just as He did to' believing Jews because their faith also made
them 'clean' (v. 8). That obedience to the Mosaic laws of cleanness and
uncleanness could no longer 'cleanse' people had been shown to Peter in
a vision (Acts 10:11--16) and demonstrated in the experience with
Cornelius, the Roman (Acts 10:17--48).

James interprets Peter's witness (15:7--11) to be an explanation of 'how
God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a
people for His name' (15:14). Gentiles could become 'clean' and become
true end-time Israelites by receiving Joel's prophesied
[]{#chap6.html#page_233}Spirit by faith without having to keep the Law
(vv. 5, 10). Thus, while the whole Law is in mind, it is the laws of
cleanness and uncleanness that are uppermost in mind. When James says
that Gentiles must 'abstain from things contaminated by idols and from
fornication and from what is strangled and from blood' (v. 20; see v.
29), he is not imposing Mosaic food laws on them, but telling them to
abstain from idolatry in order to be spiritually 'clean' in the new age.
Each of the four things Gentiles are to stay away from are connected to
the worship of idols, the first, third and fourth referring to the
animal sacrifices offered to idols ('fornication' may refer to cult
prostitution or merely to immorality, in which all Christians must not
participate).

But how does James's quotation of Amos 9 support the earlier contention
that Gentiles' hearts are 'cleansed by faith' and not by obedience to
the Old Testament laws of uncleanness? The laws about uncleanness were
primarily aimed at revealing who was not clean to dwell within the
perimeter of Israel's camp and who could come into the outer court of
the tabernacle to worship God. James's quotation demonstrates that
Gentiles are now to be considered clean for entrance into and worship in
the 'tabernacle' without keeping the Mosaic uncleanness laws, which
Peter notes is 'a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to
bear' (v. 10). The reason is that their 'hearts are cleansed by faith'
in Christ. He took the penalty of their sinful uncleanness upon himself:
through Christ 'forgiveness of sins is proclaimed . . . and through Him
everyone who believes is declared righteous from all things, from which
you could not be declared righteous through the Law of Moses'
(Acts 13:38--39). Therefore, because believers have 'died with Christ'
and have become clean in him, they no longer have to worry about
'submitting . . . to decrees, such as, "Do not handle, do not taste, do
not touch!"' (Col. 2:20--21).

### Christ's resurrection as the rebuilding of Israel's fallen temple {.int_niv2}

Christ's resurrection is most likely to be seen as the beginning
fulfilment of the Amos 9:11--12 prophecy that God would 'rebuild the
tabernacle of David which has fallen . . . in order that the rest of
mankind may seek the L[ORD]{.small}'. Jesus is the latter-day cosmic
tabernacle in which not only believing Jews but also Gentiles throughout
the cosmos may worship. Since all are 'cleansed' in him and not by
Mosaic laws of uncleanness, they also are considered clean for worship
in him as the temple. Likewise, physical circumcision is no longer
necessary for membership in true Israel nor for entrance to the
[]{#chap6.html#page_234}temple not made 'by human hands' (Acts 7:48)
because believers have been 'circumcised with a circumcision made
without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh *by the
circumcision of Christ* \[i.e., his death\]' (Col. 2:11).

That Christ's resurrection is the realization of the prophecy that God
would 'rebuild the tabernacle of David' is apparent from several
observations. Luke's reference to 'David' elsewhere in Acts is always
linked to the prophetic expectation of the Messiah's coming, especially
the resurrection fulfilled in Jesus. Acts 13:22--23 says that 'from the
seed' of David 'according to promise, God has brought to Israel a
Savior, Jesus', thus showing that the promise of 2 Samuel 7:12--13 had a
more ultimate fulfilment than Solomon: 'I will raise up your seed after
you . . . and I will establish his kingdom . . . forever.' Only a few
verses later in Acts 13:34, the fulfilment of the Davidic 'promise'
focuses on Jesus' resurrection: 'that He \[God\] raised Him up from the
dead, no more to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: "I will
give you the holy and sure blessings of David'' (quoting the prophecy of
Is. 55:3). Psalm 16:10, a Davidic psalm, is then quoted in support
(already cited by Peter to make the same point in Acts 2:27), which
foresaw Christ's resurrection: 'Thou wilt not allow Thy Holy One to
undergo decay' (Acts 13:35). Likewise the allusions to David in Acts 2
refer to Jesus fulfilling David's prophecy that his seed would rule,
after having been raised from the dead (Acts 2:24--36, where Luke
explicitly mentions 'David' three times in this
connection).[62](#appen11.html#NFIN426){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN426-1 .apnf}

Hence, in the passages of Acts in the preceding paragraph, the name
'David' is primarily associated with Jesus' resurrection as a fulfilment
of prophecy, though events surrounding Jesus' death are likewise found.
The last mention of David outside of Acts 15 is in 7:45--47, which we
discussed briefly above and now draw out further implications in the
light of Acts 13 and 15. We have seen that Solomon's building of the
temple is the climax of Stephen's survey of Old Testament history
(Acts 7:47). Stephen does not see, however, that Solomon's temple was
the final fulfilment of God's promise that David's 'seed' would 'build a
house for My name' (2 Sam. 7:12--13, 26). No human-built structure could
contain the manifestation of God's presence in his eschatological temple
(Acts 7:48). To confirm this Stephen appeals to Isaiah 66:1--2, where
the rhetorical question []{#chap6.html#page_235}'Where then is a house
you could build for Me?' must be answered negatively, since no sinful
human could ever construct a dwelling that could properly house the
Creator's presence in the eternal new creation.

Just as Christ's resurrection was the long-range fulfilment that God
would 'establish the kingdom' of the Davidic 'seed . . . who will come
forth' (2 Sam. 7:12), so the promise in the same verse of 2 Samuel 7
about this descendant building a temple likewise discovers its distant
realization in Christ's resurrection. The reason that Solomon's kingdom
and temple also could not be the completion of the prophecy is that the
prediction says that the fulfilment would last 'forever'
(2 Sam. 7:13)[63](#appen11.html#NFIN427){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN427-1 .apnf}
and that the temple would be made by God himself without human
involvement (2 Sam. 7:11b: '*the LORD will make a house* for you').
Solomon's kingdom and temple, on the other hand, were made by human
hands and did not last 'forever', even though early Jewish thought
believed that it
would\![64](#appen11.html#NFIN428){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN428-1 .apnf} 2
Samuel 7:10--13 is itself developing Exodus 15:17--18, which also
prophesies concerning 'the sanctuary' that God's 'hands have
established' and predicts that 'the L[ORD]{.small} shall reign \[there\]
forever and ever'.[65](#appen11.html#NFIN429){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN429-1
.apnf} Note, again, the emphasis on the temple being made by divine
'hands' and not human hands, and God's rule being there for ever. God's
construction of the temple without human help in the new creation will
last for ever.[66](#appen11.html#NFIN430){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN430-1
.apnf} What humans build is by nature temporary.

Given Luke's prior association of 'David' primarily with Christ's
resurrection, James's quotation of the prophecy that God would 'rebuild
the tabernacle of David' (Acts 15:16) also refers to Christ's
resurrection, which opened the gates 'that the rest of mankind may seek
the Lord' (Acts 15:17). The use of the Amos citation is probably a
direct development of Acts 13, where 'David' is referred to four times,
especially with a view to fulfilment of David's prophecies in Jesus'
resurrection. The events of Christ's resurrection and ascent
[]{#chap6.html#page_236}inaugurated his heavenly reign, as well as his
establishment of the new temple, of which his Jewish and Gentile
followers are able to become a part. The statement about 'rebuilding the
tabernacle of David' appears to be the answer about 'what kind of a
house will you build for me?' from Acts 7:49 (and Is. 66:1). No human
can build an adequate structure to house God's presence in the eternal
new order; only God can do so, which he began to do when he raised Jesus
from the dead and inaugurated the new cosmos. Again, we see in
Acts 15:16 the equation of Jesus' resurrection, which is new creation,
with 'building a temple'. The best rationale for the equation is
remembering that the Old Testament tabernacle and temple were symbolic
of the new cosmos to come in which God could dwell fully.

It becomes further apparent that the '*tabernacle* of David' in
Acts 15:16 is the new temple when one recalls that the only other uses
of 'tabernacle' (*skēnēlskēnōma*) in Acts refer to one of three things:
Israel's tabernacle in the wilderness (Acts 7:44), the more permanent
subsequent temple (Acts 7:46) or to idolatrous tabernacles of worship
(Acts 7:43). Particularly interesting is that Acts 7:46 says that David
'asked \[God\] that he might find a *dwelling place* \[*skēnōma*\] for
the God of Jacob'. Hence, David's request was not granted him but was
first given to Solomon, yet his temple fell. Ultimately, David's request
to build a permanent temple for God is granted, not to Solomon, but to
the greatest son of David, Jesus, who erects a permanent
temple.[67](#appen11.html#NFIN431){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN431-1 .apnf} This
organic connection between Acts 7:46--50 and Acts 15:16 is indicated by
the similar conceptual discussions and the telltale use of the words
'build' and 'tabernacle' together with 'David' in both
passages.[68](#appen11.html#NFIN432){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN432-1 .apnf} The
word *skēnē* also is the technical term for 'tabernacle' in the Greek
Old Testament, especially in the Pentateuch where it occurs often with
this sense.[69](#appen11.html#NFIN433){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN433-1 .apnf}

Similarly, the same word *skēnē* in Hebrews alludes either to Israel's
tabernacle (Heb. 8:5; 9:2--3, 6, 8, 21) or to the new, heavenly
tabernacle associated with Christ, of which the physical tabernacle was
but []{#chap6.html#page_237}'a copy and shadow' (Heb. 8:2; 9:11; 13:10;
so also Rev. 13:6). In striking affinity with our interpretation of
Acts 7 and 15, Hebrews 8:1--2 directly links Christ's having 'taken His
seat at the right hand of the throne . . . in the heavens' with 'the
true tabernacle, *which the Lord pitched, not man*'! The Hebrews passage
likely understands Jesus' resurrection and ascent to heaven as the
establishing of the temple in which he also ministers as a priest. The
phrase 'which the Lord pitched, not man' underscores that the new temple
is 'the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that
is to say, not of this creation' (Heb. 9:11) but built by God in the
inaugurated new creation. The discussion in Hebrews fits admirably into
the analysis of Acts 7 and 15, where the Solomonic temple was an
imperfect human-made realization of the prophecy that a descendant of
David would build a temple, and which has found fulfilment on a grander
scale in Christ's resurrection.

Qumran also apparently understood that the prophecy of Amos 9:11 was
about the building of the end-time temple: 'This is the Branch of David
who will arise with the Seeker of the Law and who will sit on the throne
of Zion at the end of days; as it is written, *I will raise up the
tabernacle of David which is fallen*. This *tabernacle of David which is
fallen* (is) he who will arise to save Israel' (4QFlor 1, 11b--13).
Amazingly, the writer appears to identify the Messiah with the new
eschatological
temple.[70](#appen11.html#NFIN434){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN434-1 .apnf} What
is especially striking is that this same Qumran
document[71](#appen11.html#NFIN435){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN435-1 .apnf}
equates the future fulfilment of the Amos 9 prophecy with the fulfilment
of the temple prophecies of respectively Exodus 15:17 and 2
Samuel 7:11--13, both of which we have also seen to be connected to the
Amos quotation in Acts:

::: cita
this is the house \[will be built at the e\]nd of days; as it is written
in the Book of \[Moses, *In the sanctuary, O Adonai*,\] *which thy hands
have established, Yah*\[*w*\]*eh will reign forever and ever*. (4QFlor
1.2)

 

'\[*And*\] *Yahweh* \[*de*\]*clares to thee that He will build thee a
house;* []{#chap6.html#page_238}*and I will raise up thy seed after
thee, and I will establish his royal throne* \[*forev*\]*er*'. (4QFlor
1.10--11)
:::

As did Luke, Qumran understood these two
prophecies,[72](#appen11.html#NFIN436){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN436-1 .apnf}
like Amos 9:11, to look forward not merely to Solomon's temple but to
the more distant latter-day
temple.[73](#appen11.html#NFIN437){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN437-1 .apnf} Later
Judaism also interpreted Amos 9:11 to be the eschatological
temple.[74](#appen11.html#NFIN438){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN438-1 .apnf}

### The Old Testament background for the Gentiles' relationship to Christ's rebuilt temple {.int_niv2}

It is important to point out that James introduces the quotation of
Amos 9:11 by saying, 'with this the words of the *Prophets* agree, just
as it is written' (Acts 15:15). This indicates that James has in mind
more than merely one Old Testament passage. In fact, it is apparent that
he weaves into the Amos citation, at least, two other Old Testament
texts: Hosea 3:5 ([LXX]{.small}) and Jeremiah 12:15--16 ([LXX]{.small}):

::: cita
And *after these things* the children of Israel shall *return* and
*shall seek the Lord* their God and *David* their king. ([LXX]{.small}
of Hosea 3:5)

 

And it shall be that, *after* I have cast them \[the Gentiles\] out, *I
will return* and have mercy on them, and will cause them to dwell, each
in his inheritance and each in his land. And it shall be that, if they
will indeed learn the way of my people, to swear by my name, 'The Lord
lives', as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then also they *shall
be built* in the midst of my people. ([LXX]{.small} of Jer. 12:15--16)
:::

Hosea 3:5 promises the restoration of Israel and her king, which
implicitly includes the rebuilding of the temple, since verse 4 has said
that Israel would be 'without' the temple during the exile which is
remedied by the promise of return in verse 5. This points further to the
'rebuilding' of 'the tabernacle of David' in Acts being, not merely the
re-establishment of a new Davidic dynasty, but the reconstruction of the
new temple. Jeremiah is intriguing because he speaks of the
[]{#chap6.html#page_239}Gentiles being '*built* in the midst of my
people' at the time of the future restoration. The language is
especially conducive to understanding Gentiles becoming part of true
Israel by means of being built as the true temple. This understanding of
Acts 15:14--18 is consistent with several Old Testament prophecies that
affirm that Gentiles will come into the divine presence in the temple of
the messianic epoch (Ps. 96:7--8; Is. 2:2--3; 25:6; 56:6--7; 66:23;
Jer. 3:17; Mic. 4:1--2;
Zech. 14:16).[75](#appen11.html#NFIN439){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN439-1 .apnf}

We remarked above that the mandate to Gentiles to 'abstain from things
contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled
and from blood' (v. 20; see v. 29) did not entail the imposing of Old
Testament food laws, but was a command that they abstain from idolatry.
Each of the four things Gentiles are to keep away from are associated
with idol worship.

This perspective may now be refined. Commentators generally acknowledge
that the four prohibitions are based specifically on Leviticus 17 -- 18.
Part of the reason that Leviticus has been drawn in is because of the
catchphrase 'in the midst of my people' (*en mesō tou laou mou*, and its
Hebrew equivalent) that occurs in Jeremiah 12:16 (one of the references
woven in with Amos 9:11 in
Acts 15:16--17)[76](#appen11.html#NFIN440){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN440-1
.apnf} and in Leviticus 17 -- 18, where the expression appears five
times (Lev. 17:8, 10, 12, 13; 18:26). The phrases are part of four
commandments that not only Israelites but also 'the alien who sojourns
in your/their midst' must keep. These four prohibitions correspond to
the same four in the apostolic decree of Acts and in the same
order:[77](#appen11.html#NFIN441){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN441-1 .apnf}

1\. 'Things sacrificed to idols' (= Lev. 17:8--9) concern both burnt
offerings and sacrifices that could be eaten by the worshipper, which
are not brought to the proper place to be 'sacrificed to the
L[ORD]{.small}' because they are illicitly offered to idols (in light of
Lev. 17:7 \[[LXX]{.small}\], 'they shall no longer offer their
sacrifices to vain gods').

2\. The reference to 'blood' (= Lev. 17:10, 12) involves a prohibition
of the eating of 'blood', no doubt because this was part of pagan
idolatrous worship.

3\. 'Things strangled' (= Lev. 17:13--14) refers to a law that anything
killed for an offering to be eaten must have its blood poured out first
[]{#chap6.html#page_240}(hence, that which does not have its blood
poured out is 'choked by its blood' or 'strangled'). Again, the reason
for the precept is likely because the protocol of pagan idolatrous
offerings was not to pour out the blood of the sacrifices before eating
them.

4\. The reference to 'sexual immorality' (*porneia*) (= Lev. 18:26)
summarizes varieties of sexually immoral relationships described in
Leviticus 18:6--25 (e.g., incest, adultery, homosexual relations,
bestiality).[78](#appen11.html#NFIN442){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN442-1 .apnf}

One reason that these immoral relationships are prohibited in the
context of Leviticus is because they are connected with idolatrous
customs, which confirms our earlier identification of the four
prohibitions in Acts 15:20, 29 as a collective prohibition from idol
worship. Sexual immorality was intertwined with Egyptian and Canaanite
idol worship. In this regard, Leviticus 17:7 appears to be a general
introductory statement fleshed out by verses 8--16, which give the
particulars associated with idolatrous worship. Likewise,
Leviticus 18:1--5 and 18:24--30 form literary bookends, introducing and
summarizing verses 6--29 in the same way: Israel is exhorted not to
practise the idolatrous ways of the nations. For example, the last verse
of chapter 18 concludes by saying, 'Thus you are to keep My charge, that
you do not practice any of the *abominable* customs which have been
practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am the
L[ORD]{.small}.'[79](#appen11.html#NFIN443){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN443-1
.apnf} There is little doubt that '*abominable* customs' and
'abominations' (in Lev. 18:22, 26, 27, 29) refer to idolatrous customs,
since the word *tô'ēbâ* ('abomination') predominantly refers in the Old
Testament and especially in the Pentateuch to
idolatry.[80](#appen11.html#NFIN444){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN444-1 .apnf}

Why then does Acts 15:20, 29 allude to Leviticus 17 -- 18? It is to show
that one of the ultimate purposes of the Law for Gentile proselytes or
Israelites was to guard them against
idolatry.[81](#appen11.html#NFIN445){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN445-1 .apnf}
Now, though the specificities of the Mosaic Law no longer apply to God's
people, they are still expected to stay away from idolatry and the
immoral sexual practices associated with it. In other words, that part
of the []{#chap6.html#page_241}Law prohibiting idolatry continues to
apply generally to God's people in the new age even as it did in the
Mosaic age. Leviticus 17 also explains the reason that idolatry was not
to be practised: worship and sacrifice were to be given only to the true
God whom the resident 'alien' in Israel and Israelites
professed.[82](#appen11.html#NFIN446){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN446-1 .apnf}
And the true God's presence manifested itself at the tabernacle, to the
door of which Leviticus 17 says the 'alien' and the Israelite were to
bring their sacrifices. Failure to do so meant that idolatrous
sacrifices were being offered, since the tabernacle was the only place
to offer legitimate sacrifice. Four times Leviticus 17 repeats that such
sacrifices were to be brought to 'the doorway of *the tent* of meeting'
(vv. 4, 5, 6, 9), where 'tent' is translated by the Greek Old Testament
as *skēnē*, another element in common with Acts 15 (v. 16).

Therefore, just as Gentile 'aliens' in Israel were to worship at the
tabernacle while abstaining from idolatry, so Gentile worshippers in the
church were to worship at the new tabernacle (*skēnē*) while keeping
away from idolatry. Just as God's presence at the tabernacle was the
reason to stay away from idol worship, so Christ's endtime presence as
the true tabernacle is the reason for not participating in idol worship.
'True worshippers shall worship the Father in \[the\] Spirit and truth'
(John 4:23). It is Christ's Spirit, no longer rituals of Mosaic Law,
that now cleanses from idolatry and all uncleanness (Acts 15:8--9) and,
indeed, protects from
idolatry.[83](#appen11.html#NFIN447){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN447-1 .apnf}
Such cleansing qualifies both ethnic Jews and Gentiles to participate in
worship in the true tabernacle of Jesus Christ, so that there is no
longer a 'distinction' of people groups in Christ (Acts 15:8--9). This
is why 'it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us \[the Council at
Jerusalem\] to lay upon you \[Gentiles\] no greater burden than these
essentials \[i.e., the essentials of abstaining from idolatry\]'
(Acts 15:28).

An important concluding observation about the Old Testament background
of Acts 15 and the relation of Gentiles to the restored temple remains
to be made. After mention of God returning and rebuilding 'the fallen
tabernacle of David' in Acts 15:16, the second half of the quotation
from Amos 9 is different from the Hebrew text
[]{#chap6.html#page_242}but in basic agreement with the Greek Old
Testament version:

This is a very complex textual problem, and the limits of the present
study do not allow for a thorough analysis. Some scholars too quickly
assume, however, that the Greek text of Amos and (or) Acts is an
erroneous translation of the Old Testament. More probably, either the
Hebrew text is corrupt and the Greek Old Testament and Acts preserve the
original Hebrew; or, alternatively and perhaps more likely, the Hebrew
text is original, and the Greek Old Testament and Acts is an
interpretation of the
Hebrew.[84](#appen11.html#NFIN448){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN448-1 .apnf} It
would be difficult to prove which is the case.

If the Hebrew is original, then it is developing the earlier promises to
the patriarchs and Israel that they would 'possess' the land of enemy
'nations' (Deut. 7:1; 9:4--5; Is. 54:3; cf. also Gen. 15:7--8; 22:17;
24:60; Deut. 8:1). More precisely, Amos 9:12 may be alluding to
Numbers 24:17--19:

[]{#chap6.html#page_243}The Numbers passage is the continuation of a
discourse only a few verses earlier, where Israel's domination of other
nations is expressed through the language of the Abrahamic promise: note
the increase of 'seed' (24:7) and the near verbatim repetition of
Genesis 12:3b in Numbers 24:9b: 'Blessed is everyone who blesses you,
and cursed is everyone who curses you.' In addition, Numbers 24 also
depicts Israel's supremacy through the metaphor of her 'tabernacle'
being like 'palm trees that stretch out, like gardens' that expand
abundantly along river banks, echoing the Garden of Eden as the primal
tabernacle.[85](#appen11.html#NFIN449){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN449-1 .apnf}
Is it accidental then that Amos also begins his restoration prophecy
with a reference to Israel's tabernacle? Likely not. Furthermore, the
continuation of Amos's prophecy about the 'raising up of the tabernacle
of David' pictures 'the rebuilding' of Israel's ruins together with
repeated horticultural language (Amos 9:13--15). This is also in keeping
with the Numbers' prophecy, where the same combination of images occurs,
as the conclusion of the Amos passage demonstrates:

::: cita
::: stroplg
When the plowman will overtake the reaper

And the treader of grapes him who sows seed;

When the mountains will drip with sweet wine . . .

They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine,

And make gardens and eat their fruit.

I will also plant them on their land,

And they will not again be rooted out from their land.
:::

::: cita_source
(Amos 9:13--15)
:::

Therefore, the Greek version of Amos and, especially, Acts would be
interpreting the prophecy of Israel's militaristic domination to be
partially fulfilled, at least, through the nations 'seeking the Lord'
and voluntarily submitting themselves to him in faith and participating
in worship in the latter-day
temple.[86](#appen11.html#NFIN450){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN450-1 .apnf} At
the same time, this is an explanation of the fulfilment of the Abrahamic
promise. Ultimately, this fulfils the original intention of Adam in the
garden tabernacle, who []{#chap6.html#page_244}was to expand it by
multiplying his seed and filling the earth with godly progeny.
Consequently, Acts 15 is a part of the New Testament testimony to the
new temple of Christ expanding by opening its gates and enlarging its
borders to include people from all the
nations.[87](#appen11.html#NFIN451){#chap6.html#ap_NFIN451-1 .apnf}

## Conclusion {.int_niv1}

The book of Acts has elaborated further on what the Gospels have
affirmed about Christ, the Spirit, and earliest Christians as forming
the beginning of the end-time temple. It remains to be seen what Paul
and other New Testament writers say on this topic.

# The inauguration of a new temple in the epistles of Paul {.chap_tit}

Paul further develops what the Gospels and Acts assert about Christ, the
Spirit and believers being the inaugurated form of the latter-day
temple.

::: {#chap7.html#niv1-025 .niv1}
## 1 Corinthians 3 {.int_niv1}

The issue in the first part of this chapter is how the leaders of the
church relate to its members. Paul explains this through the use of two
pictures. In the first (3:5--9a), Paul portrays the leaders of the
church as agricultural workers in a field, and the church he depicts as
the field. It is God alone who gives the 'increase', as a result of the
leaders' labour. Thus, the Corinthians should not be forming divisive
parties in the church that are in extreme allegiance to particular
leaders like Paul or Apollos. Such allegiance should be focused instead
on God and Christ. In the second image (3:5b--15), the workers are
architects and builders who construct a building on a foundation. The
'building' is the church, the 'work' of the architects or builders, and
the foundation they build on is Christ.

Paul then shows explicit awareness that the church is the 'temple of
God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in' the church (1 Cor. 3:16; so
also 1 Cor. 3:17: 'the temple of God is holy, and that is what you
are'). Believers are a temple because of their identification with
Christ's Spirit (3:16) and with Christ himself (3:23), though the latter
identification is not explicit in the Corinthian epistles. It may be
discernible that the subject of the temple has been anticipated in the
preceding context.

::: {#chap7.html#niv2-076 .niv2}
### The church as a garden-temple? {.int_niv2}

Paul refers to himself as having 'planted' the Corinthian church and to
Apollos as having 'watered, but God was causing the growth' (3:6;
likewise, 3:7). The 'planter' and the 'waterer' (i.e., the one who
establishes and the one who pastorally leads the church) 'will receive
his []{#chap7.html#page_246}own reward according to his own labor'
(3:8). The reason that such people will receive a 'reward' is because
they 'labor' for their divine master in his field, and he will give a
reward to the faithful laborers: 'for we are fellow-workers \[with one
another\] under God; you are God's field' or 'vineyard'
(3:9a).[1](#appen11.html#NFIN452){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN452-1 .apnf} After
speaking of the Corinthians as 'God's cultivated field/vineyard', Paul
abruptly says they are 'God's building' (3:9b).

Is this one of Paul's purportedly strange, sudden metaphorical
shifts?[2](#appen11.html#NFIN453){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN453-1 .apnf} What
does a 'cultivated field' have to do with a 'building'? Upon closer
analysis, as we will see, Paul is not speaking of a generic 'building'
but of the temple as a 'building'. If so, the shift from the
agricultural metaphor of a 'cultivated field' or 'vineyard' to a temple
may be viewed to be more natural in the light of our prior study in the
Old Testament and Gospels. There we discovered that the Garden of Eden,
Israel's garden-like promised land, and Israel's future restoration in a
garden-like land were either equated or associated with a
temple.[3](#appen11.html#NFIN454){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN454-1 .apnf} We are
not suggesting that Paul is explicitly equating the 'cultivated field'
with the following portrayal of the church as a temple. Rather, the
close association of 'garden' and 'temple' in the Old Testament and
Judaism would plausibly have influenced a similar link in Paul's mind at
some level. If so, this link, whether conscious or unconscious, is a
better possible explanation than heretofore offered for inspiring the
combination of the same images in 1 Corinthians 3.

That Paul compares God's people to a temple in verses 10--15 is apparent
from the specific description of the structure. Paul 'laid a foundation
. . . which is Jesus Christ', 'and another is building upon it'. If
anyone 'builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones,
wood, hay, straw', the fire of the day of judgment will reveal
[]{#chap7.html#page_247}the quality of each builder's work. The costly
stones will survive and the 'wood, hay, straw' will be 'burned up'.

The only other place in Scripture where a 'foundation' of a building is
laid and 'gold', 'silver' and 'precious stones' are
'built'[4](#appen11.html#NFIN455){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN455-1 .apnf} upon
the foundation is Solomon's temple: 'They quarried great stones, costly
stones, to lay the foundation of the house' (1 Kgs. 5:17); 'and the
inner sanctuary . . . he overlaid . . . with pure gold . . . So Solomon
overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold' (1 Kgs. 6:20--21). He
also covered with gold the altar (1 Kgs. 6:20), the cherubim around the
ark (1 Kgs. 6:28), the floor of the temple (1 Kgs. 6:30) and the
engraved work on the temple doors (1 Kgs. 6:35; see similarly 2 Chr. 3
-- 4). Indeed, '100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver'
were 'prepared' for the construction of the entire temple (1 Chr. 22:14;
likewise, 1 Chr. 22:16; 29:2--7). First Chronicles 29:1--7 repeatedly
refers to 'gold . . . silver . . . \[precious\] stones' (vv. 2, 7--8) to
be used for all the various parts, pieces of furniture and utensils of
the temple.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN456){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN456-1 .apnf}
Verse two of that chapter is likely the precise passage to which Paul
alludes:

Paul also calls himself a 'wise master builder' (*sophos architektōn*)
in laying the foundation, which echoes the use of the same word applied
to those who helped build Israel's tabernacle. For example, Exodus
35:31--32 refers to a skilled workman of the tabernacle as 'filled with
a divine spirit of *wisdom* \[*sophias*\] . . . to be a master builder
\[*architektonein*\][6](#appen11.html#NFIN457){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN457-1
.apnf} in all works of a master builder \[*architektonias*\] in order to
form gold and silver . . . and works in
stone'.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN458){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN458-1 .apnf}

Remember also that Solomon's temple, like the new Corinthian
[]{#chap7.html#page_248}temple of believers, was also described, not
only as containing precious metals but also full of garden-like items:
wood-carved 'gourds and open flowers' (1 Kgs. 6:18), 'palm trees and
open flowers' (1 Kgs. 6:29, 32 \[twice mentioned\]), 'pomegranates
numbered two hundred in rows around both capitals' on the two doorway
pillars (1 Kgs. 7:18--20 \['pomegranates' occurs twice\]), on the top of
which was a 'lily design' (1 Kgs. 7:22). The bronze sea in the courtyard
had two rows of 'gourds' under its brim, which was 'made . . . as a lily
blossom' (1 Kgs. 7:24--26); 'four-hundred pomegranates' around the two
capitals of the pillars (1 Kgs. 7:42); ten (!) lampstands that were
configured like trees with blossoms (1 Kgs. 7:49--50), thus resembling a
little grove. We have seen that the purpose of the garden descriptions
was to reflect the primeval sanctuary of the Garden of Eden. This
combination of precious metals with botanical depictions in Israel's
temple would have been sufficient itself to facilitate a swift move on
Paul's part from a 'cultivated field/vineyard' image to that of a
temple.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN459){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN459-1 .apnf}

Paul identifies the 'foundation' of the new temple to be Jesus Christ.
Paul 'laid' this foundation among the Corinthians when they first
believed, and now Apollos and others are 'building upon it' by teaching
and pastoring the congregation on the basis of God's word, as understood
through the redemptive work of Jesus. Hence, to 'build on the
foundation' with precious metals is not to build up the Corinthians in
their faith by 'worldly wisdom' (1:18--21; 2:1, 4--5; 3:18--23) but in
Christ, by instructing them in God's wisdom from the Scriptures and how
those Scriptures relate to the new community of faith (so 1 Cor. 10:11;
Rom. 15:4--13). In this instruction, the church leaders were 'not to
exceed what is written' in the Old Testament in the light of how it has
been understood in the new age (so 1 Cor. 4:6). The Old Testament
compared God's word to 'gold and silver' in the sense that these most
valuable of earth's commodities are surpassed by the value of God's
wisdom (Ps. 119:72; Prov. 3:14; 8:10; 16:16). The ultimate precious
possession in all the cosmos is God's word because it is permanently
true and will never pass away (Is. 40:6--8). Those who are truly saved
and built up in their faith are constructed []{#chap7.html#page_249}by
God's word and become a permanent part of his temple; accordingly 1
Peter 1:23 -- 2:7 states:

::: cita
^23^you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but
imperishable, that is, through the living and abiding word of God.

^24^For, 'All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of
the grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls off, but the word of
the Lord abides forever.'

^25^And this was the word which was preached to you.

^2:1^Therefore . . .

^2^long for the pure milk of the word, that by it you may grow in
respect to salvation . . .

^4^And coming to him as to a living stone . . . choice and precious in
the sight of God,

^5^you also as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house .
. .

^6^For this is contained in Scripture: 'Behold I lay in Zion a choice
stone, a precious cornerstone, and he who believes in Him will not be
disappointed.'

^7^This precious value, then, is for you who believe . . .
:::

Consequently, Paul, like Peter, is saying that faithful ministers who
build up their flock in the wisdom of God's word will cause them to
become part of God's temple, firmly secured to the foundation of Christ.
Peter's and Paul's text bears striking resemblance to Psalm 92:12--15,
where the temple is equated with a garden and believers are perceived as
trees 'planted' and growing on a rock foundation:

::: cita
^12^The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, he will grow
like a cedar in Lebanon.

^13^Planted in the house of the L[ORD]{.small}, they will flourish in
the courts of our God.

^14^They will still yield fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap
and very green,

^15^To declare that the L[ORD]{.small} is upright; He is my rock, and
there is no unrighteousness in Him.
:::

The psalm shows that the notion of saints being part of a garden-like
temple and resting on a rock comes from the Old Testament, and thus the
similar picture in 1 Corinthians 3 may []{#chap7.html#page_250}not be
surprising.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN460){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN460-1 .apnf}
The rough parallel between the agricultural metaphor and architectural
metaphor does not provide justification for this book's large-scale
thesis about Eden and the temple. Rather, the suggestion is that the
reason why the portrayal of the 'temple' arises in Paul's mind at this
point in 1 Corinthians 3:9b--17 is because the thesis, found elsewhere
in the Old Testament and developed by early Jewish writers, was
plausibly known to some degree by Paul, and may have sparked his linking
of the two apparently disparate images. Therefore, this may not be such
a radical change of pictures as is often thought.

### The Malachi background of the temple {.int_niv2}

The fire of the last judgment will 'test the quality of each man's
\[minister's\] work' in building on the temple foundation. That is, God
will examine the 'true metal' of the flock (1 Cor. 3:13). 'If any man's
\[minister's\] work which he has built upon it remains, he \[the
minister\] shall receive a reward' (1 Cor. 3:14). In other words, if his
flock passes successfully through the fires of judgment, then their
pastoral leader will receive their saved souls as a
reward.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN461){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN461-1 .apnf} 'If
any man's \[minister's\] work is burned up, he shall suffer loss' of his
congregation (part or whole; 1 Cor. 3:15a). In such a case, the
Christian leader 'himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire' (1
Cor. 3:15b).

That Paul has been talking about construction of the church in Corinth
as the temple becomes explicit in 3:16--17, where three times he calls
the Corinthians 'the temple of God'. In addition to the background of
Solomon's temple, the Old Testament background of
[]{#chap7.html#page_251}Malachi 3 -- 4 appears to be behind 1
Corinthians 3:10--17. The Malachi text suggests that Paul thinks the
faithful Corinthians are part of the final end-time temple that will
withstand the fiery storm winds of the last judgment:

::: cita
^3:1^Behold, I am going to send My messenger . . . And the Lord, whom
you seek, will suddenly come to His temple . . . ^2^But who can endure
the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like
a refiner's fire[11](#appen11.html#NFIN462){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN462-1
.apnf} . . . ^3^And He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver
\[[LXX]{.small} adds 'gold'\], and he will purify the sons of Levi and
refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the
L[ORD]{.small} offerings in righteousness . . . ^4:1^For behold, the day
is coming, burning like a furnace . . . and every evildoer will be
chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze . . . so that it
will leave them neither root nor branch.
:::

In language very close to Paul's, Malachi predicts that the Lord will
'come to his temple' in the latter days and will 'refine' the
priests[12](#appen11.html#NFIN463){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN463-1 .apnf} in
the temple with 'fire . . . like silver and gold', 'burning' up every
evildoer like 'stubble' and the wood of branches (cf. Prov. 17:3). That
Paul would have Malachi in mind is perhaps not unexpected because Christ
had already applied Malachi 3:1 to himself (Matt. 11:10; as does also
Mark 1:2). Though Malachi portrays the refining of priests in the
temple, Paul transforms the imagery by seeing that believers who are
part of the temple are refined like precious metal. That Paul would draw
from a prophecy concerning the end-time temple is understandable in
light of his preoccupation with the temple in verses 9--17. Paul
believes the time is coming for the fulfilment of Malachi, when God will
test the 'metal' of the temple, the church, in order to 'distinguish
between the righteous and the wicked' (Mal. 3:18), the former being
preserved and the latter judged. Those who are preserved will endure as
the true, eschatological temple composed of Christ and his people, which
is well pictured in Revelation 21:1 -- 22:5.

Three times Paul speaks of 'building upon' the foundation (3:10, 12,
[]{#chap7.html#page_252}14), clearly implying the notion of a structure
that grows over time. This fits with the concept of the growth of the
Edenic and patriarchal sanctuaries, and the Solomonic and second
temples, all of which were intended to be expanded from their original
borders or measurements to encompass the cosmos. Not only is there the
concept of growth but now there is the implicit notion of the temple
being expanded beyond the bounds of geographical Israel to include
Gentiles who are being built on Christ, the true foundation-stone of the
temple and the authentic Israel.

Perhaps not coincidentally, the word 'growth' in verses 6--7 occurs
typically in the Greek Old Testament as part of the commission to Adam,
that was then passed on to Noah and the patriarchs and was combined with
small-scale temple building
episodes.[13](#appen11.html#NFIN464){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN464-1 .apnf}
Despite the fact that a temple of God's people is being built, Paul
wants the church's ministers to realize that what appears to be the
growing construction of the visible temple may well not be the true
temple. After God's refining judgment, only those who are constructed
with permanent construction materials will remain as the true temple.

A few chapters later, Paul resumes his argument that the church is the
'temple of the Holy Spirit' (6:19). Paul underscores this point to
remind the Corinthians about why they are to avoid immorality: they are
part of the latter-day temple, and just as the Old Testament temple was
to be kept clean from defilement, how much more so are they to keep
their bodies clean and separate from immorality (6:18). In line with the
purpose of the Old Testament temple, which was to house and show forth
God's glory, Paul commands them to 'glorify God in your body' (6:20).
Just as God's glory uniquely dwelt in Israel's old temple, so the
glorious attributes of God are to be manifested in the Corinthians both
individually and corporately, since they are the new temple. Similarly,
the consummated temple in the new creation will perfectly reflect 'the
glory of God' (Rev. 21:11), and 'nothing unclean . . . shall ever come
into it' (Rev. 21:27).

## []{#chap7.html#page_253}2 Corinthians {.int_niv1}

Some commentators speak of the temple in 1 Corinthians only as a
metaphor: the church is merely 'like' a temple, but it is not part of
the beginning fulfilment of the eschatological temple prophecies from
the Old Testament.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN465){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN465-1
.apnf} Our contention that Malachi 3:1--2 and 4:1 are alluded to in 1
Corinthians 3 points to the church being the actual beginning fulfilment
of the end-time temple prophesied in the Old Testament. Paul's continued
discussion of the temple in 2 Corinthians suggests further that he
compares the church to a temple because he understands it to be the
inaugurated fulfilment of the expected latterday temple.

One of the most theologically pregnant statements in all of Paul's
writings occurs in 2 Corinthians 1:20a: 'For as many as may be the
promises of God, in Him \[Christ\] they are yes.' The 'promises' most
certainly refer to Old Testament promises that began fulfilment in
Christ. But which promises are in mind? Perhaps all of God's prophetic
promises are implied, but the ones uppermost in Paul's mind are those
that he addresses in the following context of the epistle, particularly
from 1:21 -- 7:1. The observation that 1:20 and 7:1 both refer to
'promises' (the latter introduced with 'therefore') is one of the
signposts that it is this section, at least, within which he expounds
prophetic fulfilment. Certainly, Paul is thinking partly about the
promises of a 'new covenant' with Israel (3:1--18), her resurrection
(5:14--15), new creation (5:16--17) and restoration from captivity (5:18
-- 6:18). As we have seen in an earlier chapter, the establishment of a
new temple was to be part of Israel's restoration (e.g., see Ezek.
37:26--28; 40 -- 48). Accordingly, Paul lists the temple among the
initial fulfilments of Old Testament prophecy.

::: {#chap7.html#niv2-078 .niv2}
### The church as the end-time temple in 2 Corinthians 6:16--18 {.int_niv2}

Paul's most explicit reference to believers forming an end-time temple
is 2 Corinthians 6:16a, which Paul identifies as part of the dawning
restoration promises: 'For we are the temple of the living God; just as
God said'. Paul cites several texts from the Old Testament to support
this declaration, the first of which is a prophecy of the future
temple.[]{#chap7.html#page_254}

That this Old Testament allusion is a prediction of a coming temple
indicates that Paul is not merely making an analogy between a temple
idea and that of Christians, but that Christians *are* the beginning
fulfilment of the actual prophecy of the end-time
temple.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN466){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN466-1 .apnf}

Paul appends to this prophecy two additional allusions to the Old
Testament promise that a temple would be rebuilt when Israel would
return from Babylonian captivity. The first is from Isaiah 52.

Isaiah does not exhort Israelites in general to 'depart' from Babylon,
but specifically priests who carry the holy 'vessels' of the temple that
Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Solomon's temple and had kept in Babylon
during the captivity. They are to return the 'vessels' to the temple
when it is rebuilt. When Ezekiel repeatedly speaks of God 'welcoming'
Israel back from captivity, the restoration []{#chap7.html#page_255}of
the temple is in mind: e.g., Ezekiel 20:40--41 ([LXX]{.small}) says,
'For on my holy mountain, on my high mountain . . . will I accept you,
and there will I have respect to your first-fruits, and the first-fruits
of your offerings, in all your holy things. I will accept you with a
sweet-smelling savor . . . and I will welcome you from the countries
wherein you have been dispersed.' When God will 'welcome' Israel back,
she will bring offerings to the temple on Mount Zion.

Intriguingly, Ezekiel 11:16 says that when Israel was in captivity God
'was a sanctuary for them a little while in the countries where they had
gone'! This assertion is made in direct connection with Ezekiel 10:18,
in which 'the glory of the L[ORD]{.small} departed from the threshold of
the temple' in Jerusalem (Ezek. 10:18; similarly, Ezek. 11:23). It is
likely not coincidental that God's glorious presence departed from the
temple and then is said to be with the remnant, who have gone into
captivity. His presence would return with the restored people and would
once again take up residence in another temple. It is likely that this
did not occur in the second temple that was built after Israel's return.
God's tabernacling presence expressed itself in the coming of Christ,
who 'tabernacled among' Israel, and they 'beheld his glory' (John 1:14).
Those who identify with Christ become like the Corinthians, part of the
true temple.

Paul's last allusion supporting his contention that the Corinthians are
'the temple of the living God' is from 2 Samuel 7:14.)

While 2 Samuel is the primary text, 'son' has been expanded into 'sons
and daughters' under the influence of three passages in Isaiah that
foretell the restoration of Israel's 'sons and daughters' (Is. 43:6;
49:22; 60:4), the last of which includes in its context the promise that
Israel will again worship at a restored temple (Is. 60:7, 13). The 2
Samuel prophecy is concerned with the future king and temple: 'He \[the
coming king\] shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom forever'
(2 Sam. 7:13).[18](#appen11.html#NFIN469){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN469-1
.apnf} Our discussion of Acts has demonstrated that this prophecy in 2
Samuel []{#chap7.html#page_256}was not finally fulfilled in Solomon and
his temple, but climactically in Christ's kingship and his resurrection
as the inaugurated creation of the ultimate temple. Here, as in Acts 15,
we find that the church also forms part of the temple foretold in 2
Samuel. As also in Acts, the new temple is widened to include nations
living around Israel, in this case Corinthian Greeks. As also in the
Gospels and Acts, the new temple is another way of speaking about the
new creation that has resulted from Christ's resurrection. In this
respect, 2 Corinthians 6:16--18 continues the line of argument begun at
least at 5:15--17:[19](#appen11.html#NFIN470){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN470-1
.apnf} Christ 'died and rose again on their behalf . . . Therefore if
anyone is in Christ, there is *a new creation*; the old things passed
away; behold, *new things have come*.' Christ and his people have become
what the microcosmic symbolism of the old temple foreshadowed.

Thus, 'as many as may be the promises of God, in Him \[Christ\]' they
have begun fulfilment; that is, 'they are yes' (2 Cor. 1:20); including
the prophecies of the final temple. Second Corinthians 7:1a underscores
that foremost among these promises is that of the temple prophecy, since
it appears in the directly preceding context (2 Cor. 6:16--18):
'Therefore, having these promises'. Christ initially fulfilled the
temple promise (cf. 1:20), and the readers participate in that
fulfilment also, as they are ones 'having these promises' (7:1). The
reason they and Paul fulfil the same promise that Christ does is because
God 'establishes us with you in Christ' by 'sealing' believers and
giving the 'Spirit in our hearts as a down payment' (1:21--22). While
they have only begun to fulfil the eschatological expectation of the
temple, a time will come when they will perfectly realize that hope. And
since the Corinthians form part of the new temple along with Paul, he
exhorts them to keep the new sanctuary pure, as was God's command to
priests in the Old Testament temple: 'let us cleanse ourselves from all
defilement of flesh and spirit, completing holiness in the fear of God'
(2 Cor. 7:1b).

### The church as the inaugurated and consummated end-time temple in 2 Corinthians 4:16 -- 5:5 {.int_niv2}

Paul anticipates in 5:1--5 his explicit discussion of the Corinthians as
a temple in chapter 6:

::: cita
^5:1^For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn
down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens.

[]{#chap7.html#page_257}^2^For indeed in this house we groan, longing to
be clothed with our dwelling from heaven;

^3^inasmuch as we, when we are clothed, shall not be found naked.

^4^For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened,
because we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that
what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.

^5^Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us
the Spirit as a pledge.
:::

The 'earthly tent' (v. 1) refers to the believer's mortal body that will
eventually suffer corruption (be 'torn down'). After death, however, the
Christian will 'have a building from God, a house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens' (v. 1). This refers to their future resurrection
and transformation into becoming part of the new 'heavens' and earth,
which, as we have seen and will see, is equated with becoming part of
the temple of God. The notion of the 'clothing' being the final
resurrection is clear from verse 4. That Paul has a temple image in
view[20](#appen11.html#NFIN471){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN471-1 .apnf} is
apparent from the phrase 'not made with hands', which virtually
everywhere else is a technical way of speaking about the new
eschatological
temple.[21](#appen11.html#NFIN472){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN472-1 .apnf} In
addition, the references to 'building', 'house' (v. 1), and 'dwelling'
(v. 2) occur in Paul elsewhere with respect to Israel's temple or the
church as the
temple.[22](#appen11.html#NFIN473){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN473-1 .apnf}

Though 5:1--5 pictures the future consummate form of the temple, its
reality has been inaugurated, as 2 Corinthians 6:16--18 has shown. This
is also apparent from the preceding context of 4:16--18, the thought of
which is continued in
5:1ff:[23](#appen11.html#NFIN474){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN474-1 .apnf}

::: cita
^4:16^Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.

[]{#chap7.html#page_258}^17^For momentary, light affiction is producing
for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,

^18^while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the
things which are not seen are eternal.
:::

Verses 16--17 explain that this ongoing inner renewal is equivalent to a
present increasing 'eternal weight of glory' that will finally eventuate
in a 'glory far beyond all comparison', no doubt at the time of the
final resurrection spoken of in 5:1--4. Though the readers will be
'swallowed up by \[resurrection\] life' at the end of the age (2 Cor.
5:4), such 'life' was already at 'work' in them (2 Cor. 4:12). Just as
the Spirit is linked to the origin of the resurrection life of faith in
4:12--13, so the Spirit is the 'down payment' for the future
consummation of resurrection life (5:5) (Hafemann 2000: 186--187).

The Spirit himself is the beginning evidence of the new creation,
wherein is resurrection existence and the abode of the cosmic
temple.[24](#appen11.html#NFIN475){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN475-1 .apnf}
Second Corinthians 5:5 says that God 'who prepared us for this very
purpose' of receiving resurrection life and becoming a part of the
eternal temple 'gave to us the Spirit as a down payment' of these
realities. The Spirit is not merely an anticipation or promise of these
realities but is the beginning form of them. Second Corinthians 1:20--22
makes this clearer: 'the promises of God \[from the Old Testament\] in
Him \[Christ\] . . . are yes', which mean they have begun fulfilment in
Christ's first coming. Paul then says that God 'establishes us with you
in Christ . . . and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a down
payment'.[25](#appen11.html#NFIN476){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN476-1 .apnf}
That is, the Spirit is the beginning evidence that the latter-day
promises have begun to be realized in Christ and his people. The Spirit
is 'the first-fruits' of the future 'redemption of our body' (Rom.
8:23). Likewise, Ephesians 1:13--14 asserts that believers have been
'sealed with the promised Holy Spirit who is the down payment' of the
full 'inheritance' to come at the end of the age.

It is appropriate that the process of resurrection 'renewal' (2 Cor.
4:16) is equated with a process of building up glory (4:17), since the
temple was the proper place throughout history for the abode of divine
glory. Now, God's glory appropriately resides among those in
[]{#chap7.html#page_259}Christ, the new Adam and the new temple. Paul
says as much in 1 Corinthians 6:19--20: 'Or do you not know that your
body is a temple of the Holy Spirit . . . therefore glorify God in your
body', a glory that would perfectly be reflected in the temple of the
new creation throughout eternity (e.g., Rev. 21:11; cf. Rev. 15:8).
Since the new temple that has already sprung into existence is 'not made
with hands' like the old one, likewise neither can it be seen as the old
temple could: 'the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
which are not seen are eternal' (4:18).

The manner by which glory grows in the temple is rather ironic: it is as
the believer perseveres through suffering. God's glorious 'power is
perfected in weakness' (2 Cor. 12:9). In fact, this increasing glory
through the weakness of the true, visible church is the growth of the
temple itself. As Christians trust God in the midst of trial and their
own weaknesses, God makes his glory shine in us. God has designed that
'we have this treasure' of his glory 'in earthen \[weak\] vessels in
order that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God and not
from ourselves' (2 Cor. 4:6b--7).

## Ephesians {.int_niv1}

Ephesians 2:19--22 is one of the most explicit descriptions of the
church as the temple in all of the New Testament:

::: cita
^19^So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow
citizens with the saints, and are of God's household,

^20^having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone,

^21^in whom the whole building, being fitted together is growing into a
holy temple in the Lord;

^22^in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in
the Spirit.
:::

Argument is not needed to demonstrate that Paul is portraying the church
as a temple, since it is obvious. Nevertheless, the question still needs
to be asked whether Paul merely conceives of the church as being
analogous to the temple, or whether he actually thinks the church is the
inaugurated fulfilment of the Old Testament expectations of the end-time
temple. On the basis of our investigation so far of the Gospels and
Acts, as well as particularly 1 and 2 Corinthians, the answer to the
question is most probably that Paul, indeed,
[]{#chap7.html#page_260}believes not merely that the church is 'like'
the temple but that it is the actual beginning fulfilment of the
latter-day temple prophecies from the Old Testament.

The immediate context of the Ephesians 2 passage also suggests an
affirmative answer. Verse 17 quotes a restoration prophecy from
Isaiah 57:19: 'And He came and preached peace to you who were far away,
and peace to those who were near.' The quotation supports Paul's
preceding point, that Christ's death and resurrection reconciled Jews
and Gentiles to God and, thus, to one another. If Jews and Gentiles are
reconciled to God because they are in the one Christ, then they are also
reconciled to and have peace with one another because their identity as
'one new man' in Christ surpasses any nationalistic identities that
formerly alienated themselves from one another (2:15--16). And if they
are part of Christ and a new creation in him, they are also part of the
'one Spirit' and have open 'access' to the Father (2:18). This open
access in the Spirit is interpreted in verses 19--22 to be the temple of
God and of the Spirit, the 'cornerstone' being Christ.

Christ set himself as the 'cornerstone' of the temple through his
ministry, death and
resurrection.[26](#appen11.html#NFIN477){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN477-1 .apnf}
On this 'cornerstone' together with the 'foundation of the apostles and
prophets', the church began to be built. Thus, the images of being 'in
Christ' (i.e., 'in him', 2:15), 'in one new man' (2:15), 'in one Spirit'
(2:18), and 'into a holy temple' (2:21) are all equated with one
another. They refer to the one reality of dwelling in the presence of
God in the commencement of the new creation. The inclusion of 'temple'
in these parallel descriptions of new creation is now natural to
understand when it is recalled that the Old Testament temple was a small
model of the entire universe.

The Isaiah 57 quotation is a prophecy of Israel's return from captivity,
which Paul understands to have begun fulfilment in Jews and Gentiles
turning in faith to Christ, the true Israelite
inheritance.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN478){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN478-1 .apnf}
It is no coincidence that the verses preceding Isaiah 57:19 also speak
of Israel's restoration in terms of them returning to dwell in God's
temple as a new resurrected creation:

::: cita
::: stroplg
[]{#chap7.html#page_261}^13b^'But he who takes refuge in Me shall
inherit the land,

And shall possess My holy mountain.'

^14^And it shall be said,

'Build up, build up, prepare the way,

Remove every obstacle out of the way of My people.'

^15^For thus says the high and exalted One

Who lives forever, whose name is Holy,

'I dwell on a high and holy place, and \[I will dwell\] also with the
crushed and fallen of spirit in order to make alive the spirit of the
fallen and to make alive the heart of the crushed.'
:::
:::

It is not surprising that Paul refers to Isaiah 57 in relation to the
temple, since we have observed that the same chapter was developed by
Isaiah 66:2, which was quoted by Stephen in his discussion of the
temple.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN479){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN479-1 .apnf} The
promise of the return to dwell in God's restored temple in 57:13--15
picks up the same promise from chapter 56:3--8.

::: cita
^3^Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the L[ORD]{.small}
say, 'The L[ORD]{.small} will surely separate me from His people.'
Neither let the eunuch say, 'Behold, I am a dry tree.'

^4^For thus says the L[ORD]{.small}, 'To the eunuchs who keep My
Sabbaths, and choose what pleases Me, and hold fast My covenant,

^5^To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial, And a
name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an
everlasting name which will not be cut off. ^6^'Also the foreigners who
join themselves to the L[ORD]{.small}, to minister to Him, and to love
the name of the L[ORD]{.small}, to be His servants, every one who keeps
from profaning the Sabbath, and holds fast My covenant;

^7^Even those I will bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in
My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be
acceptable on My altar; for My house will be called a house of prayer
for all the peoples.'

^8^The Lord G[OD]{.small}, who gathers the dispersed of Israel,
declares, 'Yet others I will gather to them, to those already gathered.'
:::

This passage makes clear that both redeemed Jews and Gentiles will
worship together in God's temple in the new age, the same point Paul
[]{#chap7.html#page_262}makes in Ephesians 2. Isaiah even says that the
'foreigner' who 'has joined himself to the L[ORD]{.small}' will not be
'separated from his \[God's\] people' Israel (56:3). Pre-Christian
Jewish readers would have understood this to mean that Gentiles would
become part of eschatological Israel in the same way as formerly (i.e.,
through moving to Israel, being circumcised, worshipping at a temple
structure and following Israel's Law). Part of the point in Ephesians is
that Jews and Gentiles fulfil the Isaiah prophecy by 'moving', not to
geographical Israel but to Christ, the true Israel, the true temple, the
zenith of the Law, and the true circumcision (see Heb. 12:18--24). This
was part of the 'mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not
made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed' (Eph.
3:4--5). In particular, Gentiles no longer need to adopt the customs and
outward signs associated with national Israel's Law in order to become
true Israelites and worship in the true temple. Their identification
with Christ means that they are part of the true Israel and authentic
latterday temple.[29](#appen11.html#NFIN480){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN480-1
.apnf} It was not so clear in the Old Testament that when the Messiah
would come the theocracy of Israel would be reconstituted, so that it
would continue only as the new organism of the Messiah. Part of the
revealed 'mystery' is that in the Messiah Jews and Gentiles would be
fused together, on a footing of complete equality, through corporate
identification in the one Christ (Beale 1998: 242--244).

The background of Isaiah 57 shows that Paul has in mind not merely the
temple as a metaphor for the
church,[30](#appen11.html#NFIN481){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN481-1 .apnf} but
that the church is the initial phase of the building of the final temple
that will appear at the end of the age. Why does Paul mention that
Gentiles formerly were separated from Israel's 'promise' (Eph. 2:12) but
'now' are fellow-sharers in that 'promise' (3:6)? The reason, in part,
is to under-[]{#chap7.html#page_263}score that Gentiles are identified
in Ephesians 2:19--22 with the longawaited temple promised in Isaiah and
the other prophets.

Finally, one other feature of Ephesians 2 worth noting is the emphasis
on the ongoing nature of the new temple's construction: in Christ 'the
whole building, *being fitted together is growing* into a holy temple in
the Lord; in whom you also *are being built together into* a dwelling of
God in the Spirit' (vv.
21--22).[31](#appen11.html#NFIN482){#chap7.html#ap_NFIN482-1 .apnf} We
saw a similar notion of the building or growth of the temple in 1
Corinthians 3 (vv. 6--7, 10, 12, 14). This notion of a temple gradually
increasing in size is one we have previously observed. The borders of
Eden and all subsequent temples were to be expanded until they
circumscribed the globe with God's all-pervasive presence. Yet this
purpose was never successfully pursued until it began to be accomplished
in Christ. Here, as we have also seen in 1 Corinthians 3, the temple's
expansion is beginning to be executed, in that its boundaries are
expanding to include Gentiles from around the world. The temple will
continue to expand to include more and more people until God's presence
will pervade the entire earth at the end of the age (cf. Eph. 4:13).

The concept continued to influence early Christian writers, such as the
author of the *Epistle of Barnabas*, who sees God 'building and
completing' the 'incorruptible temple' in Christ (see *Barnabas* 16:6;
see also 16:7--10). As we saw earlier in this chapter, 1 Peter 2
portrays the same image (see p. 249). Both Paul and Peter likely got the
picture from Christ himself, since they both allude to him as the
'cornerstone' of the temple, which is based on Psalm 118 and also, as we
have seen, applied to Christ in the Gospel accounts (e.g., Matt. 21:42).

That at times Christ can be referred to as the 'cornerstone' of the
temple and, at other times, the temple itself is not inconsistent. The
former picture underscores that he is the foundation of the
eschatological temple, while the latter affirms that he is the
fulfilment of the prophecies of the temple, and he is the substance
which the Old Testament temples foreshadowed.

After his greeting in verses 1--2, Paul launches off into his typical
introductory thanksgiving (vv. 3--8). The first Old Testament allusion
[]{#chap7.html#page_264}in the epistle occurs in 1:6, 10, the former a
part of the thanksgiving. and the latter a part of a prayer based on the
thanksgiving.

Several commentators have noticed that verses 6 and 10 are an allusion
to Genesis 1:28 (and perhaps 1:22). It appears that the Hebrew text may
be the focus, since the Greek Old Testament renders the Hebrew *pārâ*
('bear fruit') by *auxanō* ('increase') and *rābâ* ('to multiply') by
*plēthunō* ('to multiply'). Paul appears to give perhaps a bit more of a
literal rendering than the Greek Old Testament by translating *pārâ* by
*karpophoreō* ('bear fruit').

One might doubt that such an allusion exists in Colossians 1 because,
whereas Genesis 1 refers to the increase of humans on 'all the earth'
and their dominion over it, Colossians 1:6 refers to the word of the
gospel 'bearing fruit and increasing' 'in all the world' and 1:10 refers
to good works as 'bearing fruit' and Christians' growth 'in the
knowledge of God \[i.e., in God's word\].'

There does appear, nevertheless, to be sufficient linguistic evidence to
posit a probable and conscious allusion to Genesis 1:28. Furthermore,
the repetition of the wording in Colossians 1:10 highlights the earlier
identical phrase and points further to Paul's conscious awareness of
alluding to Genesis 1:28.

Even already in Genesis 1 -- 3, as we have seen, it is apparent that
obedience to God's word was crucial to carrying out the task of Genesis
1:26, 28 (and disobedience to it led to their failure: cf. Gen. 2:16--17
and 3:3--4, where there are three examples of misquotation or
intentional twisting of the divine word in Gen. 2). Carrying out the
mandate included defeating and ruling over the evil serpent partly by
remembering and trusting in God's word of command in 2:16--17 (note the
emphasis on God 'said' or 'saying' with reference to 2:16--17 in 2:15;
3:1a, 1b, 3). Nevertheless, the serpent ended up ruling over Adam and
Eve by deceiving them with his deceptive word.

Being 'fruitful and multiplying' in Genesis 1:28 refers to the increase
of Adam and Eve's progeny, who were also to reflect God's
[]{#chap7.html#page_265}glorious image and be part of the vanguard
movement, spreading out over the earth with the goal of filling it with
divine glory. This assumes that essential to Adam and Eve's raising of
their children was spiritual instruction in God's word that the parents
themselves were to remember and pass on.

Paul has tapped into one of the most important veins of the
redemptive-historical story-line of Scripture. In fact, as noted in
chapter 3, the mandate of Genesis 1:28 is repeated throughout the Old
Testament (usually in the form of a promise), for example, Genesis 9:1,
6--7; 12:2; 17:2, 6, 8; 22:17--18; 26:3, 4, 24; 28:3--4; 35:11--12;
47:27; Exodus 1:7; Leviticus 26:9; Psalm 107:38; Isaiah 51:2;
Jeremiah 3:16; 23:3; Ezekiel 36:10--11, 29--30; most of these contain
the actual dual terminology of 'increase and multiply' (cf. also 1 Chr.
29:10--12).

In the repetition of the commission to the patriarchs, the mention of
'all the nations of the earth' being 'blessed' by Abraham's 'seed'
alludes to a renewed human community bearing God's image and 'filling
the earth' with regenerated progeny who also reflect God's image. Thus,
these new converts are 'blessed' with the favour of God's glorious
presence and become a part of God's ever-increasing kingdom and rule
which the first Adam had forfeited. Hence, the 'ruling and subduing' of
Genesis 1:28 now includes spiritually overcoming the influence of evil
in the hearts of unregenerate humanity which has multiplied upon the
earth. By implication, the notion of physical new-born children
'increasing and multiplying' in the original Genesis 1:28 commission now
includes people who have left their old way of life and have become
spiritually new-born and have come to reflect the image of God's
glorious presence and participate in the expanding nature of the Genesis
1:26--28 commission (a similar notion is expressed in Col. 1).

The presupposition underlying such a use is likely the notion of the
'Last, Eschatological Adam', Jesus Christ, who first came as the true
'image of the invisible God' (Col. 1:15) and who initially carried out
the commission, so that his people could walk after his steps in
continuing to obey the mandate (cf. Rev. 14:4).

Such an interpretation of Genesis 1:28 which we have seen in Colossians
1, especially with the emphasis on God's word, has apparently not been
acknowledged as present in early or late Judaism. Indeed, there are a
number of examples which indicate that Jewish commentators understood
Genesis 1:28 'literally' in terms only of human reproduction (e.g.,
*Jubilees* 6:5; 10:4; 32:17b--19; *Sibylline
[]{#chap7.html#page_266}Oracles* 1:55--58, 272--274; *1 Enoch* 67:1--3;
89:49; *2 Esdras* 3:12--14a; *Sirach* 44:21; *Testament of Isaac*
3:7--8; *Barnabas* 2:34).

Nevertheless, the interpretation of Genesis 1:28 that we have discovered
in Colossians becomes more plausible by observing that it has some
precedents in Judaism and is attested elsewhere in early Christianity,
especially through a combination of the language of Genesis 1:28
together with garden imagery (often with pictures of growth) from
Genesis 2. Some Jewish texts are quite close to Colossians in affirming
that the 'increasing' of Genesis 1:28 is a growth specifically in God's
'word' (Col. 1:5--6) or in regenerate 'knowledge' (Col. 1:10). In the
eschaton, 'the nations will be multiplied in knowledge on the earth',
and 'saints' will possess immortal 'life', and 'be clothed with
righteousness' (*Testament of Levi* 18:9--10, 14). Particularly striking
is a Qumran document (4Q158 \[frags. 1--2\] 7--8) which interprets God's
'blessing' to Jacob in Genesis 32:29b as follows: 'may Yah\[weh\] make
you fruitful and \[make\] you \[numerous . . . may he fill you with\]
\[know\]lege and understanding' (note Col. 1:9--10: 'that you should be
filled with knowledge . . . in all wisdom and understanding . . .
growing in the knowledge of God'; relevant also is a passage from the
Qumran *Hymn Scroll* \[1QH 6.12--19 and 8.20--22\]; so also 4Q433a
\[frags. 1--2\]; 4Q418 \[frags. 81 4Q423 8 24?\]; and in early Christian
literature, see *Barnabas* 6:11--19).

The book of Acts refers four times to Genesis 1:28, and, like Colossians
1:6--10 and early Judaism, may refer collectively to the repeated
commission and promise later in Genesis and elsewhere together with an
interpretative focus on the 'word': 'And *the word of God continued to
increase,* and the number of the disciples *continued to multiply*
greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming
obedient to the faith' (Acts 6:7); 'But *the word of the Lord continued
to grow and to be multiplied '* (Acts 12:24); and 'So *the word of the
Lord was growing mightily and prevailing*' (Acts 19:20).

That the repeated promisory commission is most likely in mind in these
three verses is evident from noticing that Acts 7:17 actually quotes one
of the repeated commissions from Exodus 1:7, 20 (see Pao 2000:
167--169). The two verbs for 'increase and multiply' are identical to
Genesis 1:28 ([LXX]{.small}, except for 'prevail' in 19:20, which uses
*ischuō* instead of *plēthunō*, though the former verb occurs in Exod.
1:20 and the prefixed form in Exod. 1:7). These passages are virtually
identical in sense to Colossians 1:6, they all view the literal
commission about progeny to be interpreted in the new age as the
increase of the reception of God's word in new believers and the
multiplication []{#chap7.html#page_267}of believers. And, as we have
seen, the notion in Colossians 1:10 is very similar.

What is striking is that Christ is identified as the eschatological Adam
in Colossians 1:15 ('the image of the invisible God') and in 3:10 those
believing in Christ also are said to 'have put on the new man' (i.e.,
they are in Christ, the new Man, Adam) and are being 'renewed to a true
knowledge according to . . . \[God's\] image . . .' This identification
shows the rationale behind Paul's application of the Genesis 1:28
commission to believers in 1:6, 10, who are identified with the Last
Adam and his commission. Even more striking is Colossians 1:9: 'we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the
knowledge of his \[God's\] will *in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding*'. The last phrase is based partly on Exodus 31:3 (35:31
is virtually identical): 'I have filled him with a divine Spirit
\[*pneuma*\] of wisdom \[*sophia*\] and understanding \[*synesis*\] and
knowledge \[*epistēmē*\]'. The Exodus passage describes the ability to
build the tabernacle. Such an allusion here fits admirably between two
references to Genesis 1:28, since our thesis throughout the book so far
has been that Genesis 1:28 is carried out by expanding the temple of
God. In fact, the same conception is likely expressed by the Acts 6:7
allusion to Genesis 1:28 and the reference in 6:3 to people 'full of the
Spirit and wisdom' (from Exod. 31:3; 35:31; cf. also Is. 11:2) who were
to perform tasks helping the apostles to spread the 'word'. Stephen was
one such person (so 6:10). All of this is a suitable introduction to
Stephen's defence that Christ would destroy the temple and pave the way
for a new one (6:13 -- 7:60, on which see the discussion in ch. 6).

Furthermore, Colossians 1:19 refers to Christ as the end-time temple.

Paul applies the psalmist's reference to God dwelling in Israel's temple
to God now dwelling in his son, apparently as the expression of the
latter-day temple in which God's presence fully resides.

[]{#chap7.html#page_268}Therefore, the identification of believers with
temple-building in verse 9 becomes more understandable (they are
building on Christ, the foundation of the temple). Some of the earlier
Jewish references that understood Genesis 1:28 in terms of including an
expansion of God's word by saints also compared the Qumran saints to an
expanding temple (4Q158 \[frags. 1--2\] 7--8; 1QH 6.12--19 and 8.20--22;
4Q433a \[frags. 1--2\]; 4Q418, frag. 81 4Q423 8 24?; so also *Barnabas*
6:11--19)! Hence, both Paul and Qumran have interpreted Genesis 1:28 in
connection with the temple in similar ways.

# The temple in 2 Thessalonians 2 {.chap_tit}

::: dev
This chapter[1](#appen11.html#NFIN484){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN484-1 .apnf}
will be a more in-depth study of one passage than other chapters of the
book, since 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is considered by many commentators and
many in the church to be one of the clearest passages in the New
Testament affirming that a future temple will be built in Israel
directly prior to Christ's second coming.

Second Thessalonians 2:4 refers to the Antichrist 'who opposes and
exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that
he takes his seat in the temple of God'. Does this refer to a future
physical temple to be built in Israel during the period of a great
tribulation? Does it refer to the Roman emperor who led his armies in
destroying Israel's temple in [AD]{.small} 70? Is it a mere vague
apocalyptic reference without a precise historical identification? The
circumstances that lead up to this reference first need brief summary in
order for us to understand its specific meaning better.

## The content of the false teaching in Thessalonica {.int_niv1}

Paul highlights in 2:1--12 that false teaching will not deceive God's
people, if they stand firm in the truth. He opens this chapter by
referring to the subject of Christ's final 'coming' (*parousia*). It is
Paul's response to a misguided understanding of both the nature and the
timing of Christ's glorious coming. There were several forms of false
teaching about Christ's final advent in the early church, which points
to the fact that erroneous doctrine in general had run rampant in the
first Christian communities.

It is unlikely that the errant teaching was about incorrectly set
timetables concerning Christ's imminent return. Rather, the erroneous
instruction claimed that eschatological events *had already happened*.
This is apparent from observing that Paul's use of *enistēmi*
[]{#chap8.html#page_270}('to be present', 'come') in his other epistles,
in line with the typical contemporary Hellenistic usage (Moulton and
Milligan 1972: 215), alludes to the present time in contrast to the
future (e.g., Rom. 8:38; 1 Cor. 3:22;
7:26).[2](#appen11.html#NFIN485){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN485-1 .apnf}
Therefore, the use of the perfect tense verb in 2 Thessalonians 2:2
likely has the classic 'perfect nuance' of an event occurring in the
past, the effects of which continue into the present: the false claim is
that Christ's coming and the final resurrection have already happened,
so that there should be no present expectation of any further future
occurrence of either of these events.

This deceptive teaching in Thessalonica has analogy with a false
teaching in Corinth that denied there was to be a final, *physical*
resurrection of the dead (1 Cor. 15:12--24). The false teachers
apparently believed that spiritual resurrection from the dead, which
Paul would affirm happens to all at conversion as an inaugurated
end-time event,[3](#appen11.html#NFIN486){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN486-1
.apnf} is the only resurrection there would ever be. This may have
entailed a belief that there would be no final coming of Christ at all.
Paul combats such a notion by contending that all dead believers will be
physically resurrected at the end-time, when Christ comes to conclude
history (cf. 1 Cor. 15:20--58). There was also a similar problem in
other early Christian churches (2 Tim. 2:18; Ignatius, *Letter to the
Philadelphians* 7:1; 2 Pet. 3:3--13; *Gospel of Thomas* 52 \[51\]).

Apparently in Thessalonica, as elsewhere, false teachers were claiming
that Jesus' future advent had already happened in some spiritual manner:
either by his coming in the person of his Spirit (perhaps at Pentecost)
or in conjunction with the final (spiritual!) resurrection of the
saints. That both Christ's coming and the saint's resurrection are in
mind in verse 1 and are the content of the 'day of the Lord' in verse 2
is discernible respectively from the wording of verse 1: 'the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to Him', which alludes
to Christ's coming in the first epistle to gather saints at the final
resurrection (so 1 Thess. 4:14, 'God will bring with Him \[Jesus\] those
who have fallen asleep in Jesus'). The common wording and theme show
that 2:1ff. isa further unpacking of 1 Thessalonians 4:14--17 and that
the false teaching was an over-realized distortion of that part of
Paul's first epistle.

When Christians become 'shaken' and uncertain about the verities of
their faith, they become 'disturbed' (*throeō*). Paul writes to keep
them fastened to the solid rock of truth. Paul's own authentic divinely
[]{#chap8.html#page_271}inspired 'word' or 'letter' is the cure-all to
any pseudo- 'prophecy, report or letter' ([NIV]{.small}) allegedly
coming from him.

## The prophesied sign of the final future apostasy {.int_niv1}

Paul summarizes in verse 3 what he has just said in verses 1--2: 'Let no
one in any way deceive you' (v. 3a). True saints are to respond
positively to this command in the face of the false teaching of verse 2.
Why should they not be misled by such instruction? The first reason is
that Christ will not come back finally until there has 'first' come a
'falling-away' (*apostasia*) from the faith. Though the word *apostasia*
can refer to a political or a religious
crisis,[4](#appen11.html#NFIN487){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN487-1 .apnf} the
latter is the only use in the Greek Old
Testament[5](#appen11.html#NFIN488){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN488-1 .apnf} and
New Testament,[6](#appen11.html#NFIN489){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN489-1 .apnf}
and it is the meaning here (so also Frame 1912: 251). Such a meaning is
apparent because of the immediate context of false teaching (vv. 1--2
and vv. 9--12) and the clear allusions to Daniel's prediction of an
end-time opponent who will bring about a large-scale compromise of faith
among God's people.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN490){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN490-1
.apnf} That the apostasy will not occur primarily in the non-Christian
world, as thought by Frame (1912: 251), but within the covenant
community is clear from four observations:

1\. 'a falling away' assumes some sort of 'prior turning to
God';[8](#appen11.html#NFIN491){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN491-1 .apnf}

2\. the above-noted usage of *apostasia* in the Old Testament;

3\. the immediate context of deception within the church;

4\. the closest verbal parallel in *Martyrdom of Isaiah *2:4--5, where
'the angel of iniquity' empowers evil Manasseh 'in causing apostasy
\[*apostasia*\], and in the lawlessness \[*anomia*\] which was
disseminated in
Jerusalem'.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN492){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN492-1 .apnf}

*Apostasia* in the Greek Old and New Testaments always refers to a
'departure from faith' and never to a 'bodily resurrection', as some
want to argue who see the word referring to a pre-tribulation
'rapture'.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN493){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN493-1 .apnf} A
negatively religious nuance of 'departure' is also
[]{#chap8.html#page_272}probable, since in verse 3 it is conjoined with
the 'man of lawlessness', and in verses 8--12 deception and departing
from the faith also appear in conjunction with 'the lawless one'.
:::

`<!--@@niv1-->`{=html}

::: {#chap8.html#niv1-031 .niv1}
## The prophesied sign of the future Antichrist in the temple {.int_niv1}

In addition to the sign of 'apostasy', a second reason why the readers
should not be misled into believing that Christ has already come is
because the eschatological appearance of the Antichrist must also
precede the Messiah's last advent. Therefore, Christ cannot have come
back yet, since these two signs have not yet come about in their full
form. Possibly, 'first' means the 'apostasy' will come before 'the man
of lawlessness', but commentators are probably correct in generally
agreeing that 'first' formally applies to both events merely happening
before Jesus' final coming.

Therefore, it may be that at the same general time there is a 'falling
away' from the faith, the Antichrist himself will make his appearance in
history, especially in a future temple. On the other hand, despite the
formal meaning of 'first', the 'falling away' could occur initially, and
then the Antichrist could appear and take advantage of the 'falling
away',[11](#appen11.html#NFIN494){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN494-1 .apnf} or,
more probably, as in Daniel 8 and 11, his coming could instigate the
'apostasy'. This is supported by recalling that Antiochus Epiphanes
instigated 'apostasy' (*apostasia*) in Israel (e.g., 1 Maccabees 2:15
and context), which is significant since many believe his activity to be
the first fulfilment of the Daniel 11:31ff. prophecy.

A major question posed by verses 3--4 is whether this refers to a future
apostasy in the land of Israel and the coming of the Antichrist to
defile a yet future rebuilt temple in Israel or to the Roman emperor's
defiling of Israel's temple in [AD]{.small} 70. In contrast to these
alternative views, the following analysis will contend that these verses
refer to a future apostasy throughout the worldwide church and the
Antichrist's influence in the church, which is itself the inaugurated
end-time temple of God. Of course, this discussion has significant
implications for the main topic of this book, the relation of the Old
Testament temple to the inter-advent age and its culmination.

In addition, the expression 'man of lawlessness' (*anthrōpos tēs
anomias*) echoes Daniel 12:10--11 (Theodotion), which is strikingly
similar to Daniel 11:29--34, and refers to the end-time trial as a
period when 'the *lawless ones* \[*anomoi*\] will do *lawlessness*
\[*anomēsōsin*\], and all the *lawless ones* \[*anomoi*\] will not
understand' (i.e., they will mislead or be misled, or both). This doing
of lawlessness in Daniel is directly linked to, if not partly explained
by, 'the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the
abomination of desolation is set up' (Dan. 12:11; cf. 11:31) by the
end-time enemy *in the
temple*.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN497){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN497-1 .apnf}

According to the prophecy of Daniel 11:30--45, a final enemy of God will
attack the covenant community. The attack is to take two forms. First, a
subtle attack of deception by influencing with 'smooth words' some
within the community 'who forsake the holy covenant' (v. 30) and 'who
act wickedly toward the covenant' (v. 32), all of which stands behind
Paul's reference to 'the apostasy' in verse 3 (Vos 1979: 111). The
Antichrist will influence these people to become 'godless' themselves
(v. 32), to compromise and to foster deception
[]{#chap8.html#page_274}and further compromise among others. Daniel says
that 'many will join with them \[the faithful\] in *hypocrisy*',
claiming to be faithful but in fact are not (v. 34). Second, the
end-time foe will persecute those who remain loyal to God's covenant
(vv. 33--35, 44). This end-time antagonist will appear openly before the
community, 'exalt and magnify himself above every god' (v. 36), and then
meet his final end under God's judicial hand (v. 45). Hence, Paul is
developing the Daniel 11 -- 12 prophecy in verses 3--4 and following.

What does it mean that the end-time adversary of God's people will 'take
his seat in the temple of God', where he will do his deceiving work?
Does Paul believe that Daniel prophesies the desecration of a literal,
physical temple? Many believe this refers to the rebuilding of a
material temple structure for Israel in Jerusalem at the end of time and
the setting up of the Antichrist himself in that temple to deceive and
be an object of worship.

### Problems with understanding the temple as a material structure in light of the issue of the 'apostasy' {.int_niv2}

The problem with a 'material' view of a future temple building is
manifold. First, 2 Thessalonians 2:3 appears not to be talking about an
'apostasy' from the faith in a geographically conceived Israel. The
majority of Israel was always 'apostate' and unbelieving throughout the
Old Testament era and at the time of Christ, and has been throughout
history since that time. Even according to a futurist perspective, it
may be difficult to view this passage as referring to a falling away of
ethnic Israel, since the majority of Israel will have continued to be
unbelieving up to and during the time the Anitchrist will appear
(according to the futurist view, it is only at the very end of history
that the majority of Israel will
believe).[15](#appen11.html#NFIN498){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN498-1 .apnf} It
is also difficult to conceive of verse 3 as alluding to an apostasy of
unbelievers among the nations who are not part of the visible church,
since the majority of them will have been unbelieving throughout the
interadvent age.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN499){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN499-1
.apnf} Verse 3 instead appears to be alluding to a yet future massive
'falling away' in the community of faith, the church, throughout the
world that has not happened hitherto.

It is certainly possible to opt for some kind of apostasy among ethnic
[]{#chap8.html#page_275}Israelites and reject the alternative adopted
here (Best 1972: 282--283). A reason for preferring this view could be
that it was too early in the Christian movement for Paul to conceive of
such widespread unbelief in the earliest churches, and nowhere else in
the so-called 'genuine' letters does Paul suggest any such widespread
apostasy. This objection is deflected, however, by recalling that Paul
understood the Christian community as the continuation of true Israel in
the midst of which pseudo-covenant keepers could exist. This is why Paul
can apply prophecies about Israel to the church throughout his
writings,[17](#appen11.html#NFIN500){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN500-1 .apnf}
including the Daniel 11 prophecy about Israel's eschatological falling
away.[18](#appen11.html#NFIN501){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN501-1 .apnf}

### Problems with understanding the temple as a physical structure in the light of the gospels {.int_niv2}

Furthermore, that verse 3 is about a massive apostate movement towards
the end of history in the church and not in Israel is apparent from the
phrase 'the temple of God' in verse 4. This reference to 'the temple'
also shows that the church community is the place where endtime
prophecies about Israel and its temple will take place. The actual
phrase 'temple of God' is found ten other times in the New Testament
outside of 2 Thessalonians, and, except once, it always refers to the
church.[19](#appen11.html#NFIN502){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN502-1 .apnf} Only
one time does it refer to a literal temple in Israel of the past or
future. In Matthew 26:61 Jesus is quoted as saying, 'I am able to
destroy *the temple of God* and to rebuild it in three days.' This use
is significant because it provides a transitional perspective between
the Old Testament prophecies of a future, eschatological temple and the
way Jesus began to view those prophecies as beginning to be
fulfilled.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN503){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN503-1 .apnf}
The physical temple is mentioned in order to indicate a
redemptive-historical shift to the end-time temple. Matthew sees the
material temple being
destroyed[21](#appen11.html#NFIN504){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN504-1 .apnf} and
rebuilt in Jesus' resurrection body.

[]{#chap8.html#page_276}That Jesus' resurrection represented the initial
rebuilding of the temple is even clearer in John 2, where Jesus says
essentially the same thing as in Matthew 26:61 (2:19--22), and there the
evangelist adds that when Jesus referred to rebuilding or 'raising up'
the temple, 'he was speaking of the temple of his body' and of his own
resurrection. Jesus' resurrection was the beginning of the rebuilding of
the latterday 'temple of
God'.[22](#appen11.html#NFIN505){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN505-1 .apnf}
Israel's former, physical temple was but a physical foreshadowing of
Christ and his people as the temple. For, remember, the primary point of
the temple was that it was the place where God's glorious presence was
manifested on earth to his people. Now that Jesus has come as God
incarnate, he is now the place where God's presence is manifested in the
world. In this respect, even preceding the John 2 statement, John 1:14
says, 'and the word became flesh, and tabernacled \[or 'became a
temple'\] among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as an only-begotten
from the Father, full of grace and truth'.

## Problems with understanding the temple as a physical structure in the light of Paul's writings elsewhere {.int_niv1}

As we have seen in the preceding chapter, Paul elsewhere refers to
believers as 'the temple of God' because they have believed in Jesus,
who is the temple, and are identified with him as such and are a part of
his body. Paul says twice in 1 Corinthians 3:16--17 that believers are a
temple of God. Similarly, 2 Corinthians 6:16 affirms twice that
believers 'are the temple of God'. Second Corinthians 1:20 says that the
'many promises God has made \[in the OT\] . . . are "Yes" in Christ'
([NIV]{.small}), which means they have begun to be fulfilled in the
Corinthians who are 'in Christ'. Among the prophecies beginning
fulfilment are those about the eschatological temple, as 2 Corinthians
7:1 says in further explanation of 6:16--18: 'we are the temple . . .
Since we have these promises . . . let us purify ourselves'
([NIV]{.small}; likewise, cf. Eph. 2:19--21; 1 Pet. 2:4--7; Rev. 3:12,
etc.).[23](#appen11.html#NFIN506){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN506-1 .apnf}

That the 'temple of God' in 2 Thessalonians is the church is pointed to
further by recalling Paul's earlier depiction of the
[]{#chap8.html#page_277}Thessalonian church by imagery and wording in 1
Thessalonians 4:8 ('God who gives His Holy Spirit to you') that
parallels the cultic imagery in 1 Corinthians 6:19: 'Or do you not know
that your *body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you
have received from
God?'*[24](#appen11.html#NFIN507){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN507-1 .apnf} Such
an understanding is consistent with Paul's penchant to refer to the
church with the Old Testament names of Israel: e.g., 'the Israel of God'
(Gal. 6:16),[25](#appen11.html#NFIN508){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN508-1 .apnf}
'the elect of God' (Col. 3:12), 'saints', 'the circumcision . . . who
worship in the Spirit of God' (Phil. 3:3), etc. (so Findlay 1904: 170).

## Problems with understanding the temple as a physical structure in the light of the book of Revelation {.int_niv1}

Particularly striking in comparison with 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is the
apocalyptic text of Revelation 13:6, which even portrays the Antichrist
attacking believers who are depicted as a 'tabernacle' (*skēnē* in
Greek) and who live in the midst of deception all around them (cf.
Rev. 13:3--8). I will argue in the following chapter that
Revelation 11:1--7 contains the same picture. In Revelation 13:6, the
phrase 'his tabernacle' is immediately followed by 'the ones
tabernacling in heaven', which is a recollection respectively of the
'sanctuary' and heavenly 'host' in Daniel 8:10--13: the end-time tyrant
'caused some of the host \[of heaven\] and some of the stars to fall to
the earth', and 'magnified himself to be equal with the Prince of the
host and . . . the place of His sanctuary was thrown down' (Dan. 8:11).
That is, in Revelation 13:6, 'his tabernacle' blasphemed by the beast is
immediately clarified, even without a conjunction, to be 'the ones
tabernacling in heaven'. In Daniel 8:10--11, the action is directed both
against heavenly
saints[26](#appen11.html#NFIN509){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN509-1 .apnf} and
saints on earth, though in 2 Thessalonians the focus is only on an
earthly attack, which is also the focus in Revelation 11:1--7 (though
there the attack is against saints who are pictured as a 'sanctuary' and
'lampstands' in it).

What brings the 2 Thessalonians and Revelation passages close together
for comparison is the fact that both are apocalyptic in nature and
allude to and interpret Daniel's eschatological opponent prophecies.
Furthermore, as we will argue below (on 2 Thess. 2:6), the
[]{#chap8.html#page_278}fulfilment of the Daniel 11 prophecy has begun
unexpectedly (from an Old Testament reader's vantage point) within the
church and thus further identifies the church with the temple, since
Daniel foresees these events as inextricably linked to the
temple.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN510){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN510-1 .apnf}

::: {#chap8.html#niv2-083 .niv2}
### Objections to understanding the church as the temple and responses {.int_niv2}

Some conclude that the Christian church is not the temple in 2
Thessalonians 2:4, since 'in the present context . . . no mention is
made of the believer and the indwelling of the Spirit of God as in 1
Corinthians'.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN511){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN511-1 .apnf}
But neither in the context is there a hint of any other kind of temple,
so that the next best context within which to interpret 2:4 is the other
epistolary references to God's new temple, which is the church. This
discussion so far of the preceding context also favours the church on
earth being the temple. The identification of the temple as being 'God's
holy temple in heaven' is secondarily
right.[29](#appen11.html#NFIN512){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN512-1 .apnf} The
temple of God is Jesus and all who identify with him, so that the cultic
eschatological centre of gravity has shifted to heaven where Jesus is,
and his glorified saints, but with Pentecost that heavenly temple
extends to earth wherever God's Spirit indwells people. The greater
focus in 2 Thessalonians, however, is on Antichrist's attack on the
earthly form of this temple, though in most of the relevant passages in
the Apocalypse the heavenly form of the temple is
pictured.[30](#appen11.html#NFIN513){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN513-1 .apnf}

F. F. Bruce is a likely representative of others in his objection to
identifying 'the temple of God' with the church because such a
conception 'is inapplicable at this early stage, when there was no
united church organization which could provide such a power base' (Bruce
1982: 168--169). Bruce's contention, however, is weakened because it
does not take into consideration the following important issues:

1\. The locus of true Israel had already shifted from the theocratic
nation to Christ and his followers (if we are to rely on the testimony
of the Gospels).

2\. Similarly, as we have seen in the first Thessalonian epistle (2:16),
[]{#chap8.html#page_279}Paul believed that national Israel as the chosen
people of God had come to its end. Presumably, the end of Israel's
temple also would have been included in Paul's understanding, since
Christ had predicted its destruction (e.g., Luke 21:6, 32). This means
that Paul could not have viewed Israel's temple as 'the \[true\] temple
of God' *even before* its actual destruction in [AD]{.small} 70, and it
is unlikely that he uses this phrase in verse 4 to refer to 'the temple
of God' as the same kind of Israelite temple directly preceding the
lawless one's entrance into it (following Findlay 1982: 170). Such an
unlikelihood is supported by realizing that an Antichrist would not be
very effective at trying to deceive the true people of God (Christians),
if he made the centre of his religious activities a temple controlled by
unfaithful Israelites. In addition, it is not merely the ungodly nature
of the temple's management that renders it improper as a reference to
the true temple, but Christ's coming as the true temple, priest and
sacrifice (so Heb. 7:11 -- 10:22) made the first-century temple obsolete
in a redemptive-historical sense: e.g., see especially Hebrews 9:11, 24,
'when Christ appeared as a high priest . . . He went through the greater
and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands . . . the true one . .
. heaven itself'. Likewise, Hebrews 10:19--21 asserts that believers
'have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new
and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil \[of the
temple\], that is, His flesh . . . since we have a great priest over the
house of God . . .'

3\. The point of 2 Thessalonians 2:3--4 is that whatever the temple is
to be identified with, it pertains to the visible covenant community in
which true believers dwell and into which the lawless one is to make his
entrance. In this respect, the small fledgling church throughout
Palestine, Greece and Asia Minor is as good a candidate for an
identification of the 'temple' as is a localized physical temple in only
one small nation of the world.

4\. This point is bolstered by recognizing that the pseudo-Christ figure
of verses 3--4 is paralleled with Christ. This makes it more probable
that his false messianic claims aimed at deceiving Christians would be
made primarily in the new covenant community, where Christians exist,
and not in the cultic centre of the old covenant community in Jerusalem
(Hamann 1953: 428), or in a future revival of such a cultic place.
Furthermore, the lawless one's activities summarized in verse 4 are
amplified in verses 8--12, where among the people deceived are likely
those who considered themselves part of the church community (e.g.,
those deceived are people who 'did not receive the love of the truth so
as to be saved').

[]{#chap8.html#page_280}Unlikely also is the objection that the temple
cannot be the church since 'the scope of the lawless one's actions seem
much broader than just the church' (Martin 1995: 236). Only if the
'temple' were to be construed as the entire world of believers *and
unbelievers* could this objection be sustained. From one perspective, it
is correct that the end-time opponent's activities will occur throughout
the world, since the church as the temple is to be found scattered
throughout the world. It is also true that, in the light of other New
Testament texts (Rev. 16:12--16; 19:19--20; 20:7--10), the scope of some
of Antichrist's deceiving activities goes beyond the church, but the
only place where the end-time adversary's activity occurs in 2
Thessalonians 2:4 is the 'temple', which I have argued is the church.
And, though the Antichrist may deceive many outside the church, it is
only within the worldwide church where his deception leads to
'apostasy', since those outside the church never professed faith in the
first place.

Leon Morris also objects to the church being the 'temple' for two
additional reasons (1959: 223). First, for the final antagonist to be
able to establish himself in a position of authority in the church and
call himself God would preclude the church from being considered a
Christian church. True enough, but the same could be said about Israel's
physical temple (an identification Morris prefers). Such a temple would
not function according to its true purpose if the Antichrist were
allowed to establish himself in it and arrogate to himself divine
authority. Furthermore, the point Paul appears to be making is that the
visible church community, within which true saints exist, will become so
apostate that it will be dominantly filled with people who profess to be
Christian but really are
not.[31](#appen11.html#NFIN514){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN514-1 .apnf} The
church will continue to profess to be Christian but most in it will
actually not be true believers.

Second, Morris believes that, while the New Testament does refer to a
falling away in the end times, it does not view the church as becoming
apostate. But Jesus himself says that 'many will fall away . . . and
many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many. And because
lawlessness is increased, most people's \[covenantal\] love \[for God\]
will grow cold' (Matt. 24:10--12). Global unbelief like that in the
'days of Noah' will occur directly before Jesus' final coming (Matt.
24:38--39; Luke 17:26--27). Jesus warns those in the community of faith
to be ready for the apostasy and his return, acknowledging that
[]{#chap8.html#page_281}some will not be vigilant and will be judged
(Matt. 24:40 -- 25:46; Luke 17:28--37). This points to the likelihood
that both those outside the church and many, if not most, within the
church will be unbelieving. Revelation 11:7--13 and 20:7--10 also
prophesy a great, universal deception at the end, which likely means
both an intensification of unbelief among already hardened people
outside the church and especially 'apostasy' within the
church.[32](#appen11.html#NFIN515){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN515-1 .apnf}

It needs to be remembered that the universal 'apostasy' is to occur only
within the covenant community spread throughout the world and that
unbelievers outside the church will be further hardened and deceived,
leading to their attempt to annihilate any true believers remaining. As
already noted, the 'falling away' spoken of in 2 Thessalonians precisely
and predominantly takes place, not in the unbelieving world, but in the
church because it involves a 'falling away' from an earlier condition of
'being close' to God (i.e., at least, a profession of such). If Paul
leaves apostasy open as a possibility for the Thessalonians, why could
he not have considered the same as a possibility for the entire church
at the end of the age (Martin 1995: 234)? If Paul can say even before
his death that 'everyone in \[the churches of\] the province of Asia has
deserted me' (2 Tim. 1:15, [NIV]{.small}), how much more could this be
true at the end of the age? Thus, just as Christians in the church of
Sardis were known to 'live' though they were really spiritually 'dead'
(Rev. 3:1; cf. also Matt. 7:21--23!), so it will be the case for the
worldwide professing church at the very end. Such an expectation
comports well with early Jewish beliefs of largescale apostasy within
the community of faith in the latter
days.[33](#appen11.html#NFIN516){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN516-1 .apnf} Just as
'many' in Israel were apostate at the time of the first phase of
fulfilment of Daniel 11:31ff. (1 Maccabees 1:11, 15, 43; 2:15), and the
majority likewise were unbelieving during the second phase of fulfilment
([AD]{.small} 30--70), even more so will it be the case in the new
covenant community at the final phase of fulfilment immediately before
Jesus' final coming (Hendriksen 1979: 169).

### The question of whether the Antichrist's 'sitting' is literal or figurative {.int_niv2}

What does it mean that the Antichrist will 'take his seat in the temple
of God' in 1 Thessalonians 2:4? We have contended so far that some
future temple in Israel is not in mind. Nor is it likely to refer to
[]{#chap8.html#page_282}a particular past desecration of the temple in
Jerusalem, ineptly or otherwise prophesied by Paul (which some identify
with the Roman overthrow in [AD]{.small}
70).[34](#appen11.html#NFIN517){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN517-1 .apnf} No
temple desecration in the first century could be in mind, since verses
3--4 speak of an escalated 'falling away' that had not yet happened in
Paul's time and probably did not occur only twenty years later in
[AD]{.small} 70.[35](#appen11.html#NFIN518){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN518-1
.apnf} Furthermore, the final coming of Antichrist is still expected in
the nineties by
John.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN519){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN519-1 .apnf}

I. H. Marshall takes an opposite stance by concluding that no particular
temple is in mind. Instead, he argues that verse 4 is speaking
metaphorically only 'to express the opposition of evil to
God'.[37](#appen11.html#NFIN520){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN520-1 .apnf} While
possible, it is more probable that the temple is a more specific
reference to the church as the continuation of the true temple because
of the arguments set forth so far above, which we summarize here:

1\. The use of the phrase 'the temple of God' elsewhere in Paul without
exception refers to the church, and 'temple' in Revelation can refer to
both true believers on earth or in heaven.

2\. The Daniel 11:30ff. prophecy and its initial fulfilments (with
Antiochus Epiphanes and then the Romans) take place within the covenant
community and revolve around the temple in that community. Futhermore,
if Antiochus Epiphanes in the second century [BC]{.small} was an initial
fulfilment of Daniel 11:31--36, then that fulfilment could be considered
an event concerning Israel's second architectural temple that became a
typological foreshadowing of the church as the eschatological spiritual
temple.

3\. The 'apostasy' and its uses elsewhere in biblical literature all
have to do with a 'falling away' by those within the covenant community
from a former confession of loyalty to God.

Accordingly, 'to take his seat in the temple of God' is likely not a
reference to the Antichrist's literal positioning of himself in a chair
in the physical temple. Rather, a figurative 'sitting' is in view, in
line with other metaphorical uses in the New Testament. For example,
Matthew 23:2 says, 'the scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves
in the seat of Moses' (expressing a class of authoritative
[]{#chap8.html#page_283}interpreters), and there are repeated references
to 'Christ sitting at the right hand of God' in heaven, which is
figurative for his
'rule',[38](#appen11.html#NFIN521){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN521-1 .apnf} since
it is unlikely that there is literal furniture in
heaven.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN522){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN522-1 .apnf}

A non-literal notion of 'sitting in the temple' is supported further by
the observation of many commentators that 2 Thessalonians 2 is
apocalyptic in nature. '*Sit* on a throne' (with *kathizō* or
*kathēmai*) in the Apocalypse is used often (approximately 15 times)
figuratively for God, Jesus or saints being in a position of authority,
which is enhanced by the obviously metaphorical picture of Jesus
'*sitting* on a cloud' in heaven (in Rev. 14:14--15). Perhaps most
comparable to 2 Thessalonians 2:4, however, is the negative picture of
Babylon the Whore 'who *sits* on many waters' (Rev. 17:1) and is dressed
as a priest (17:4; 18:16), which is interpreted as ruling over 'peoples
and multitudes and nations and tongues' (Rev. 17:15, 18;
18:7).[40](#appen11.html#NFIN523){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN523-1 .apnf} This
conclusion is consistent with the apocalyptic imagery of 2 Thessalonians
2:8 that is based on the same Isaiah 11:4 text as in Revelation 19:15,
both of which portray Jesus judging the final enemy. The Revelation
passage portrays Jesus defeating the corporate foe and their leader,
while 2 Thessalonians pictures Christ 'slaying' the eschatological fiend
'with the breath of his mouth'. The depiction in both apocalyptic
passages underscores Jesus' convicting and punishing the enemy by means
of God's Law that has been disobeyed (on which see below at v. 8). The
figurative nature of 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is also in keeping with 2:15,
where Paul does not command the Thessalonians literally to 'stand' like
soldiers on parade rest or to 'hold' on to something with their hands
but to continue to believe the truth (Callow 1982: 81--82)!

Consequently, verses 3--4 mean that the latter-day assailant will come
into the midst of the church, 'the temple of God', and cause it to
become predominantly apostate and unbelieving. He will then try to take
control of the church by spreading deception in it. That the end-time
antagonist will 'display himself as being God' could mean that he makes
himself out to be God, which is the epitome of blasphemy. Such blasphemy
is most comparable to the Greek and Roman rulers who conquered Israel
and the temple and set up idols of themselves in the temple to be
worshipped as gods.

On the other hand, the idea may be that the Antichrist assumes so much
influence and religious authority in the global community of
[]{#chap8.html#page_284}faith that he might as well be calling himself
God. This is more consistent with the description of the eschatological
adversary in Daniel 11, where it says that he will 'magnify himself
above every god' and will honour a false god himself (so Dan.
11:36--39a). Therefore, he must not be claiming that he is an actual
god, since he still worships some false god or idol. The point is that
there are some ways that he sins so intensely that he is putting himself
in the place of God. For example, he changes God's laws in Scripture and
teaches other laws that contradict divinely revealed truth (Dan. 7:25;
8:11--12, 25; 11:30--32 affirm this). This is one reason that he is
called 'the man of lawlessness'. In doing so he is acting like God. In
essence, the Antichrist claims to be the ultimate Lawgiver, and the laws
he gives contradict the God of the Bible's
laws.[41](#appen11.html#NFIN524){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN524-1 .apnf}

## The beginning fulfilment of Antichrist's prophesied defilement of the temple in the Thessalonian church {.int_niv1}

Paul has said in verses 3--4 that the readers should not be led astray
in thinking that Christ's coming has already happened because the two
signs of the final apostasy in the church and the final appearance of
Antichrist have not yet
occurred.[42](#appen11.html#NFIN525){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN525-1 .apnf} He
states emphatically in verse 5 that a third reason they should not be
deceived about this is because what Paul has just told them is not new
information. Paul has repeatedly told them about the coming apostasy and
Antichrist: 'Do you not remember that when I was still with you I was
telling you these things?' Verses 3--4 were a reminder of what they
already knew. The implication of the reminder is that Paul has perceived
that the readers were becoming vulnerable to false teaching because they
were in process of forgetting the truth he had already taught them.

[]{#chap8.html#page_285}Though Paul has underscored that the final
manifestation of the Antichrist is yet future, in verses 6--7 he warns
them that they cannot relax and let down their guard against his
deceptive powers in the present. In fact, Paul makes the radical
statement that they are not any safer from deception now than when
Antichrist will actually come! Consequently, saints must not suppose
that because the Antichrist has not yet come he cannot mislead them now.

We saw in verses 3--4 that Daniel 11:30--45 prophesied that a final foe
of God would attack the covenant community in the latter days. The
attack was to take three forms: persecution, desecration of the temple
and deception through the subversion of divine truth. Paul first says in
verse 6 that this antagonist has not yet come in full consummate form
because something 'is restraining him now, so that in his time he may be
revealed'. The purpose of the restraining force is to hold back the
manifestation of the lawless one until it is the right time for his
appearance. This also they should know because it is part of the
instruction he had given them during previous visits (so v. 5).

::: {#chap8.html#niv2-085 .niv2}
### The 'restrainer' who temporarily prevents Antichrist's final appearance {.int_niv2}

Commentators are greatly divided about the identification in verses 6--7
of '*the one who now holds . . . back*' ([NIV]{.small}'s rendering of
*ho katechōn* in v. 7, though also possible is the translation of 'the
one who restrains'). Any identification faces the problem of explaining
the change from referring to the 'restrainer' with the neuter gender in
verse 6 (*to katechon*) to the masculine gender in verse 7 (*ho
katechōn*). Most of the proposed solutions attempt to isolate an
impersonal force in verse 6 and then link it with a personal one in
verse 7. There are, at least, seven different identifications of the
'restrainer'.[43](#appen11.html#NFIN526){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN526-1 .apnf}

It is difficult to determine with probability the precise identification
of the 'restrainer' ('possessor' is also a possible translation).
Nevertheless, what is likely is that it/he is good and not evil, since a
contest or tension between two inimical powers appears to make the most
sense of the
passage.[44](#appen11.html#NFIN527){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN527-1 .apnf}
Additionally, it is clear that God is the ultimate power behind whatever
historically particular agent is in
mind.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN528){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN528-1 .apnf} This
[]{#chap8.html#page_286}is explicit from the observation that the
'restrainer' will restrain until the revelation of the Antichrist 'at
the proper time' ([NIV]{.small}, literally 'in his \[the restrainer's or
the Antichrist's or God's\] own time') (see Best 1972: 276 for these
three options). This 'time' is certainly set by God, since the whole
segment (vv. 6--12) is placed within a prophecy-fulfilment
framework.[46](#appen11.html#NFIN529){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN529-1 .apnf}
God will bring history to a conclusion in his own timing. Verse 9 may
suggest that Satan determines the timing of the lawless one's appearance
(so Wanamaker 1990: 254). The verse, however, focuses more on the force
which 'energizes' the activities of the final tyrant (in line generally
with Rev. 13:2, 4) (so Bruce 1982: 173) rather than on the time when he
will be revealed. The closest Pauline parallel is 1 Timothy 6:14--15:
'until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which He \[God\] will
bring about in His own time (*kairois idiois*)'. This passage in 1
Timothy points further to Paul's thought being upon God as the sovereign
disposer of historical events (cf. *heautou kairō* of 2 Thess. 2:6 with
*kairois idiois* in 1 Tim. 6:15).

In the meantime, the 'restrainer' will continue to hold back the
appearance of the final opponent 'until he \[the restrainer\] is taken
out of the way', when it is finally time for Antichrist to be manifested
(v. 7b).[47](#appen11.html#NFIN530){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN530-1 .apnf}

::: {#chap8.html#niv2-086 .niv2}
### The 'mystery' of how Daniel's prophecy of the Antichrist in the temple has already begun fulfilment {.int_niv2}

Though Paul says the prophesied 'man of lawlessness' has not yet come in
full incarnate form, he nevertheless claims there is a sense in which he
has come: 'the mystery \[*mystērion*\] of lawlessness is *already* at
work'. What does Paul mean by this? As with the majority of New
Testament uses of 'mystery' (*mystērion*), this one also is placed in
close connection with an Old Testament reference, this time to Daniel 11
in 2 Thessalonians 2:4. The word elsewhere, when so linked to Old
Testament allusions, is used to indicate that prophecy is beginning
fulfilment but in an unexpected manner in comparison to the way Old
Testament readers might have expected these prophecies to be fulfilled
(see Beale 1998: 215--272).

The reason Paul uses the word 'mystery' in verse 7 is that he
understands the Antichrist prophecy from Daniel as beginning to be
ful[]{#chap8.html#page_287}filled in the Thessalonian church in an
enigmatic manner not clearly foreseen by Daniel. Daniel says that the
final Antichrist would appear in full force and openly to all eyes ('to
exalt and magnify himself'), when he would attempt to deceive and
persecute. Paul sees that, though this fiend has not yet come so visibly
as he will at the final end of history, he is *nevertheless '*already at
work' in the covenant community through his deceivers, the false
teachers. We would expect from Daniel's prophecy that when this fiend's
deceivers are visibly on the scene, he would be visibly present as well.
The revealed 'mystery' in the church at Thessalonica is that the
prophecy of Daniel 11 is starting to be fulfilled unexpectedly, since
the devilish foe has not come in bodily form, but he is already
inspiring his 'lawless' works of deception through false teachers!

There is another unexpected element of the way Daniel is fulfilled.
Daniel predicts that the end-time tyrant will desecrate the physical
temple in the Israelite city of Jerusalem. This prophecy, however,
begins fulfilment through false prophets, the corporate 'body of the
Antichrist', who infiltrate the church, not only as the new covenant
community but also as the new temple in a Gentile city! First John 2:18,
22 also says the Antichrist was already present in the church to which
John was writing: 'it is the last hour; and just as you heard \[from
Daniel and Jesus\] that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists
have arisen; from this we know that it is the last hour . . . the one
who denies that Jesus is the Christ . . . is *the antichrist*' (so also
1 John 4:3; 2 John 7!). Therefore, the Thessalonian Christians, and we,
must not think that the Antichrist's deception will come only when he
appears in final fleshly form, but we must be on our guard *now* in
order not to be deceived by his unusual invisible coming into the new
covenant temple through his corporate emissaries, the false teachers!

Jesus also refers to the same prophecy from Daniel to which Paul is
referring (see Matt. 24:4--5, 10--13, 23--26). Just as the main point in
2 Thessalonians 2:1--7 is on 'do not let anyone deceive you' (v. 3), the
main point of the Matthew 24 passage is that no-one mislead Jesus'
followers about his second coming (vv. 3--4). Jesus predicts that before
he comes, many antichrist's will, indeed, come. He is focusing not on
the final arrival of one Antichrist but on the coming into the church of
many antichrist's who are the semi-fulfilments and forerunners of the
final predicted opponent of God (Matt. 24:5, 10--15, 24). These are the
same false prophets to which 1 John 2:18 and 2 Thessalonians are
referring. Jesus even says in Matthew 7:21--23 that those who were
regarded as teachers of the church will be judged as
[]{#chap8.html#page_288}false teachers at the final judgment. Note that
Jesus refers to them as those who practised 'lawlessness' (*anomia*),
the same word used in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 in the phrase 'the mystery of
lawlessness'.

Paul is saying that even now the false teachers that have been
prophesied by Daniel and Jesus (cf. Matt. 24:4--5, 23--24, etc.) are
with us. This means that the end-time 'great tribulation' has begun in
part! The prophecy of the 'apostasy' and coming of 'the man of
lawlessness' into the temple of the new covenant church has started
fulfilment!

Indeed, the sign of Jesus' death together with what 1 John 2:18 and 2
Thessalonians 2:6--7 have said makes it clear that the great
tribulation, when Antichrist would come, has already begun to take
place. The prophesied latter-day temple has also started to appear in
the form of the church community (see on v. 4) into which verse 7 says
the Antichrist has already begun to enter and defile. Daniel predicted
that there would be three telltale marks of the great tribulation:
persecution, desecration of the temple and deception through false
teachers within the temple and in the covenant community. It is clear
that persecution and deception in the ecclesiological sanctuary started
in the first century and has continued ever since. The desecration of
the temple is the entry of the unclean and deceptive spirit of the
Antichrist into the sacred community of faith, which attempts to alter
God's laws. Therefore, the tribulation has been going on throughout the
age of the church (for persecutions in Thessalonica see Acts 17:5--8; 1
Thess. 1:6; 2:14; 3:3--4). To be sure, this tribulation has not yet
reached its climax. There will be an escalation of the present
tribulation when *the* incarnate Antichrist appears at the end of
history. At that time, persecution and deception, which have formerly
affected only part of the church throughout history, will be present
throughout the worldwide church, the temple, at which point Christ will
return (see Rev. 11:1--13; 20:1--10). In this light, the expression the
'temple of God' in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is not an exception to but
naturally falls in line with all of the New Testament's (including
Paul's) nine other applications of the same expression to the church
elsewhere.

## Conclusion: does Paul spiritualize Daniel's temple prophecy? A 'literal' versus a 'redemptive-historical' approach {.int_niv1}

Some will surely object to the preceding discussion on the grounds that
it 'spiritualizes' Daniel's prophecy about the Antichrist and
[]{#chap8.html#page_289}especially the temple. Many affirm that the
prophet Daniel surely had in mind a physical temple that will exist in
latter-day Israel. Accordingly, to say that this prophecy is fulfilled
in Christ and the church is to violate 'a literal hermeneutical'
principle by which all Scripture is to be interpreted.

A number of responses are in order, some of which have already been
anticipated in earlier discussions, and more will be given in a
concluding chapter on 'Theological conclusions'. First, a 'literal
hermeneutic' is not the best way to describe a biblical hermeneutic.
Perhaps a 'literate hermeneutic' that aspires to the broad literary
meaning in the canonical context is a better way to put it (see
Vanhoozer 2001: 312--314). We should want to follow an interpretative
method that aims to unravel the original intention of biblical authors,
realizing that that intention may be multi-layered, without any of the
layers contradicting the others. Such original intentions may have
meaning more correspondent to physical reality (hence socalled 'literal
interpretation') while others may refer to 'literal' spiritual
realities.

Second, the progress of revelation certainly reveals expanded meanings
of earlier biblical texts. Later biblical writers further interpret
earlier biblical writings in ways that amplify earlier texts. These
subsequent interpretations may formulate meanings that earlier authors
may not have had in mind but which do not contravene their original,
essential, organic meaning. This is to say that original meanings have
'thick' content and that original authors likely were not exhaustively
aware of the full extent of that content. In this regard, fulfilment
often 'fleshes out' prophecy with details of which even the prophet may
not have been fully cognizant.

Third, our interpretation of 2 Thessalonians 2:1--7 indicates that Paul
understood the Daniel 11 prophecy about the end-time opponent
desecrating the temple as beginning fulfilment in his own time.
Possibly, my interpretation is wrong. To say it is wrong, however,
primarily on the basis that it does not 'literally' interpret the book
of Daniel is not enough to overturn my analysis. Or, one could say Paul
illegitimately 'spiritualizes', though this is not an attractive option
for those with a high view of Scripture. Such a conclusion could also
reveal an over-confidence in the standards of modern interpretative
methods as the ultimate arbiter of the correctness of ancient
interpretative methods.

If my analysis of 2 Thessalonians is on the right track, then Paul is
developing the interpretation of Daniel 11 -- 12 in the light of
[]{#chap8.html#page_290}progressive revelation: the beginning fulfilment
of Daniel's prophecy in Christ and the church. We have observed in the
preceding chapters and in this chapter that Christ is the true end-time
temple, and all who identify with him by faith become part of that
temple. There are pseudo-believers who claim to be part of the true
temple. It is into the midst of that temple of a mixed multitude of
loyal and disloyal covenant-keepers that the incarnate Antichrist steps
during the very last days of history.

God promised to dwell in a temple among his eschatological people. The
main purpose of the temple in the Old Testament and the purpose of the
expected end-time temple was to house God's glory before which his
people were to worship. Many Israelites may well have understood the
prophecy in Daniel 11 to refer to a physical temple in which the
Antichrist would appear, and, following his demise, God's glory would be
manifested in such a temple to a greater extent than ever before. We
have discovered in preceding chapters, however, that some of the Old
Testament's explicit end-time prophecies of the temple foresee a
non-structural, non-human-made reality (e.g., Is. 4:5--6; 57:15;
66:1--2; Dan. 2; Zech. 1 -- 2). In addition, similar observations have
been made about the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2; Ezek. 28:18), the
small-scale sanctuaries of the Patriarchs, Mount Sinai and God's
dwelling with Israelite exiles (Ezek. 11:16; cf. also Is. 8:14.) How
does one put together the passages like Daniel 11:30--39 that appear to
predict a structural eschatological
temple[48](#appen11.html#NFIN531){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN531-1 .apnf} and
those prophesying a non-structural one? Do the former serve as the
interpretative key for the latter or vice versa? Or, are these two sets
of prophecies contradictory or impossible to harmonize from the human
interpreter's perspective?

We believe the non-structual prophecies should interpret the apparent
structural ones because this best fits the New Testament's
interpretation of the Old Testament prophecies about the temple. We have
endeavoured, not only in this chapter, but in preceding chapters, to
show that the New Testament explains that the temple prophecies have
begun fulfilment through Christ's glory in the land of Israel, and views
the consummated fulfilment to be God and Christ's glory manifested
throughout the entire cosmos. The precise physical form in which the
temple promise may have been conceived has been surpassed in the
fulfilment of a greater literal reality of God's expansive presence. It
should certainly not be a surprise that the New Testament
[]{#chap8.html#page_291}could conceive of the new temple as
non-structural in the light of the numerous Old Testament precedents of
such a phenomenon!

This is to say that progressive revelation has clarified those
prophecies that appeared to be predicting a structural temple. The
prophecy and the fulfilment of Daniel are comparable to a father's
promise to his young son in 1900 that he will give his son a horse and
buggy when he grows up and gets married. When the son marries thirty
years later, the father gives him a car, which has since been invented
and mass-produced. Does the father not literally fulfil his promise to
the son? It is true that the precise form in which the promise of a mode
of transportation was given has changed, but the essence of the promise
has not changed: a convenient mode of personal transportation. Indeed,
the progress of technology has made the fulfilment of the promise even
greater than initially
conceived.[49](#appen11.html#NFIN532){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN532-1 .apnf}

The substantial essence of the new temple is still the glory of God,
however that glory is no longer confined within a material building but
revealed openly to the world in Christ and his subsequent dwelling
through the Spirit in the worldwide church as the
temple.[50](#appen11.html#NFIN533){#chap8.html#ap_NFIN533-1 .apnf} The
progress of God's revelation has made the fulfilment of apparent
prophecies of an architectural temple even greater than originally
conceived by finite minds. This is what Haggai 2:9 appears to express:
'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former.'

The practical relevance of this discussion for the contemporary church,
the temple, is that the spirit of the Antichrist may already be found
hovering in its midst when its leaders change God's word and contradict
its meaning. For example, many church leaders today say that we need to
be accepting of other faiths, contending that sincerity in any kind of
faith may be a legitimate path to God. 'Who are we to say that *we* have
the only truth?' To many, the exclusive claim of Christianity sounds
narrow and harsh. Yet Jesus himself said, 'I am the way, and the truth,
and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me.' His follower
Peter said, 'there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other
name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be
saved' (Acts 4:12). Such teachings represent
[]{#chap8.html#page_292}'the lawlessness' of the Antichrist prophesied
by Daniel to pollute the end-time temple. True believers need to be on
the alert not to be deceived by such eschatological corruption, in order
to keep 'the temple of God' doctrinally and ethically pure.

Indeed, it should not be assumed that the 'spirit of the Antichrist' (1
John 4:1--3) influences only unbelieving false teachers. Leaders who are
true Christians and those under their guidance are susceptible to this
influence and can be caught up in worldly ways of thinking. All in the
church to one degree or another are confronted and tempted by this
worldly influence. This is why we need continually to be alert to
resisting it.

# The inauguration of a new temple in Hebrews {.chap_tit}

::: dev
The book of Hebrews discusses the tabernacle or temple more than any
other New Testament book, except perhaps for John's Apocalypse, which
gives prolonged descriptions of the heavenly temple. The author speaks
more of the 'tabernacle' than the 'temple', but what he says of the
former also applies to the latter. We have seen that the temple in
Jerusalem was the permanent form of the mobile tabernacle and that the
two are so closely related that, for all intents and purposes, they are
functionally
identical.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN534){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN534-1 .apnf}
Hebrews may focus more on the tabernacle than the temple because its
overall shape and the furniture in it are described in more detail in
the Old Testament (in Exodus) and are more explicitly related in the Old
Testament to a heavenly 'pattern' than is the temple (see Exod. 25:9,
40). This focus presumably makes it easier for the author to draw
parallels from the earthly tabernacle to his conception of the present
heavenly tabernacle and sanctuary.

Before focusing on the temple, however, it is important to recall the
main points of Hebrews within which discussion of the temple occurs as a
subordinate topic to the overriding concern of the book: who is Jesus in
relation to the Old Testament epoch? The book begins by underscoring the
absolute supremacy of Jesus over angels and humans (1:3 -- 2:16). He is
also greater than Moses (3:1--6), partly because Moses' leadership did
not result in the ultimate 'rest' for God's people (3:7--19); likewise,
Christ is greater than Joshua for the same reason (4:6--11). Jesus is
the high priest par excellance (4:14 -- 5:10), and as such he is a
priest in the line of Melchizedek, a priestly order superior to that of
the Levitical priesthood, offering up a superior sacrifice in comparison
to the sacrifices of the old covenant (7:1--28). In fact, the Levitical
priesthood, their temporary sacrifices, and the sanctuary in which the
priests served are but old covenantal shadows of the new covenant in
which Christ is the eternal high priest as well as the abiding sacrifice
in an everlasting tabernacle (8:1 -- 10:22).

[]{#chap9.html#page_294}Throughout the epistle there are paraenetic
sections exhorting the readers to press forward in their profession of
Christ and not drift back to the old covenantal forms of worship. The
purpose of the writer is to exhort the readers to maintain their faith
in Christ, his priestly work and his sacrifice for them, from which they
are in danger of falling away and thus committing apostasy.

Having briefly surveyed the main themes of
Hebrews[2](#appen11.html#NFIN535){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN535-1 .apnf} and
how the tabernacle is a part of those themes, we now want to attempt to
determine in the following discussion how the view of the tabernacle in
Hebrews fits in or contributes to the overall biblical perspective of
the temple that we have so far been studying in this book.

::: {#chap9.html#niv1-036 .niv1}
## The temple in Hebrews 8 {.int_niv1}

The first substantial discussion of the temple in Hebrews occurs in
8:1--5 in conjunction with the subject of the role of the priesthood. In
particular, verses 1--2 affirm the following:

::: cita
^1^Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high
priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens,

^2^a minister in the sanctuary, and in the true tabernacle, which the
Lord pitched, not man.
:::

Christ is a new high priest who, as a result of his resurrection and
ascension, has sat down at the right hand of God's heavenly throne. This
heavenly place of rule is, however, not merely a king's palace. It is
also a 'sanctuary . . . and true tabernacle' (v. 2). 'Sanctuary' is a
rendering of the Greek plural of *hagios*, which literally means
'holies' or 'holy places' (*hagiōn*). We have seen that this plural form
is an Old Testament way of speaking about the earthly temple complex
with its various holy precincts (e.g., Lev. 21:23; Ezek. 7:24;
Jer. 51:51).[3](#appen11.html#NFIN536){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN536-1 .apnf}
Thus, this is probably a specific reference to the 'holy of holies'
since the next mention of plural 'holies' in 9:3 has this in mind: 'And
behind the second veil, there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy
*of Holies*.' Likewise, this abbreviated form 'holies' clearly refers to
the holy of holies in 9:8; 10:19; and 13:11 (following Ellingworth
[]{#chap9.html#page_295}1993:
400).[4](#appen11.html#NFIN537){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN537-1 .apnf} Instead
of the earthly sanctuary, the focus in 8:2 is on the sanctuary in
heaven, which the author also calls 'the true tabernacle'.

## Does Hebrews spiritualize the tabernacle? A 'literal architectural' versus a 'redemptive-historical' approach {.int_niv1}

The heavenly sanctuary of Hebrews 8 is called the 'true tabernacle'
because the earthly one was but a 'copy and shadow of the heavenly' one
(8:5a). The gist of verse 5b confirms this: 'just as Moses was warned by
God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "See . . . that you
make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the
mountain"' (quoting Exod. 25:40). Hebrews informs us of something that
was not clear in Exodus: the pattern that Moses saw on Sinai was
apparently of the true heavenly tabernacle that was to come later with
Christ and descend and eventually fill the whole earth. It was this
eschatological sanctuary of which Moses was to make a small earthly
model. This was the 'true tabernacle' because it was the 'genuine
article', the 'literal' and real one. In contrast, the earthly tent was
but 'a copy and shadow', a figurative portrayal of the literal heavenly
one (so also Heb. 9:24) that was 'the greater and more perfect
tabernacle' (Heb. 9:11). Heaven is viewed 'axiologically . . . as the
"place" of God's presence, \[that\] transcends earth as the source of
all reality and value' (Lane 1991: 210--211).

It is important to underscore the 'true' nature of the new tabernacle in
which Christ now dwells and the 'figurative' tabernacle that God dwelt
in during Israel's wilderness wanderings. Some Christian interpreters
believe that what is literal can only be physical and what is
non-literal must be non-physical. The author of Hebrews, however, gives
precisely the opposite definition: the literal sanctuary is the heavenly
one and the figurative sanctuary is the earthly. Hebrews 9:8--9 even
refers to the old 'tabernacle' (precisely, the holy place) as a 'symbol'
or 'parable' of the end-time tabernacle (e.g., in 9:11) in order to
underscore that the former tabernacle was not ultimately the real one
(Walker 1996: 204). Part of the reason for this resides in the meaning
of the author's use of 'true' (*alēthinos*). The reference to the
tabernacle as 'true' in Hebrews 8:2 and 9:24 connotes both (1) that
which is 'genuine' or represents 'the real state of
affairs'[5](#appen11.html#NFIN538){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN538-1 .apnf} of
reality and (2) prophetic typological fulfilment.

[]{#chap9.html#page_296}One of the best illustrations of a similar use
of 'true' occurs in Revelation 3:14, where Christ calls himself the
'faithful and *true* witness', and designates himself as the genuine or
authentic witness in contrast to fleshly Israel as false
witnesses.[6](#appen11.html#NFIN539){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN539-1 .apnf} The
word 'true' likely includes more than mere moral and cognitive truth,
but also the idea of 'authentic' in the redemptive-historical sense of
Jesus being *true* Israel by fulfilling the Isaiah 43:10--19 prophecy
about God and Israel's witness to the new creation. In contrast to
unfaithful Israel, he fulfilled the prophecy by perfectly testifying to
the new creation both before and after his resurrection. Jesus' witness
was about himself, since he was the centrepiece of the new creation. In
this manner, he demonstrated himself to be the true end-time Israel
prophesied by Isaiah. This attribute of authenticity in Revelation 3 may
also be viewed against the Isaiah background of God saying that Israel
should be a faithful witness, in contrast to the nations as false
witnesses to their idols or their idols themselves being false
witnesses, which the nations mistakenly believe to be the 'truth'
(*alēthē*; Is. 43:9). Therefore, Christ is the 'true witness' after
which all other faithful witnesses are modelled (cf.
Rev. 2:13).[7](#appen11.html#NFIN540){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN540-1 .apnf}

Likewise, Hebrews refers to the heavenly tabernacle as 'true' because it
is the fulfilment, not only of direct prophecies of the eschatological
temple, but of everything the Old Testament tabernacle and temples
foreshadowed. They were all intended to be imperfect models and
temporary 'copies' of the coming true, eternal temple (see again
Heb. 8:5). As we will see in our study of the use of Haggai 2 in Hebrews
12:26--28 below, the end-time temple is 'greater and more complete'
(Heb. 9:11) than the old one because it is 'unshakeable', permanent, and
eternal. It cannot be changed, nor can it ever pass away, because it is
made not by imperfect human hands, but by God's hand as a new creation.

Thus, we may say that the eschatological temple is 'true' not only in
the sense of fulfilment but also in that, unlike the previous temples,
it is the ultimate one that will remain for ever. The former temple was
not the 'true one', not only because it was a mere shadow of the one to
come []{#chap9.html#page_297}but because it would cease to
exist.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN541){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN541-1 .apnf} To
believe that a physical temple will be built after the eschatological
one has been inaugurated would be to return to the former 'shadowy'
stage of temple existence. Once the end-time, eternal temple that
corresponds to the reality of the heavenly one comes, it would be a
strange reversal for God to commend a return to the shadows. To believe
that Israel's temple or one rebuilt by human hands would last for ever
is a false view because it mistakes the symbolic temple (Heb. 9:8--10)
for the real one (Heb. 9:11).

Edmund Clowney has underscored how crucial it is to comprehend that this
perspective of the temple

::: cita
is not spiritualization in our usual sense of the word, but the very
opposite. In Christ is realization. It is not so much that Christ
fulfils what the temple means; rather Christ is the meaning for which
the temple existed . . .

Our reflection on the claims of Christ has already shown us that his use
of the Old Testament is far from figurative. The situation is completely
reversed. In the wisdom of God's purpose the earlier revelation points
forward to the climax, when, in the fullness of time, God sent his own
Son into the world.

Christ is the true temple, the true light, the true manna, the true
vine. The coming of the true supersedes the figurative. The veil of the
temple made with hands is destroyed, for its symbolism is fulfilled.

At the cross the actualization of the symbolism of sacrifice is
particularly clear. It is not a figurative use of Old Testament language
to say that Christ is the Lamb of God offered to make atonement for sin.
The sin-offering at the temple altar is not being 'spiritualized' when
we say it is fulfilled in Christ. Neither is the temple being
'spiritualized' when we say that in the resurrection the true temple was
raised up. No earthly temple made with hands can ever again become the
place of God's dwelling. (Clowney 1972: 177, 182--183)
:::

These notions are certainly part of what is behind Christ's
selfassertion that his presence on earth meant that 'something greater
[]{#chap9.html#page_298}than the temple is here' (Matt. 12:6). All of
the things that pointed towards Christ in the Old Testament (sacrifices,
temple, manna, kings, priests, etc.) find their most 'literal' or 'true'
meaning in him.

There may be additional reasons that can be inferred from other biblical
writings which could lie behind Hebrews' assertion that the literal
temple is not the physical but the heavenly one: (1) the perspective of
the Old Testament and Acts with respect to why the end-time temple
cannot be 'handmade' and (2) Revelation's view that God's presence in
Israel's temple was to be extended throughout the new creation, which
becomes equivalent to a latter-day temple. Though these reasons are not
explicitly mentioned by the author of Hebrews, they may have contributed
to the background of his thinking. (See the excursus at the end of this
chapter.)

There was a sense in which God was responsible for constructing Israel's
tabernacle in that he commanded Moses to make it. But Hebrews 8:5
emphasizes that the tabernacle Moses was to make was to be done
'according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain'. That is,
that tabernacle was only a copy and small model of the yet-future
end-time tabernacle to be made only by God by incorruptible materials,
not of this creation but of the coming new creation. Thus, 'the Lord
pitched' the new tabernacle and 'not man'. What is significant about the
reference to Numbers 24 is that it is one of the Old Testament passages
we have proposed to be a part of Israel's Adamic mandate as a corporate
Adam to enlarge the boundaries of her garden-like tabernacle until they
circumscribed the entire
earth.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN543){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN543-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap9.html#page_299}In like manner, an Aramaic version (*Tg.
Neofiti*) of Numbers 24:6 understands the botanical expression 'like
aloes planted by the Lord', originally part of the expanding garden
depiction in the Hebrew text, to refer to the tabernacle: 'like the
heavens which God has spread out as the house of his Shekinah, so shall
Israel live and endure for ever beautiful . . . and exalted among his
creatures'.[11](#appen11.html#NFIN544){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN544-1 .apnf}
Thus, we have in this Aramaic interpretation of Numbers 24:6 the picture
of Israel's commission to spread out over the earth being compared to
the extension of the cosmic tabernacle of the heavens that God spread
out in his first creation to house his
glory.[12](#appen11.html#NFIN545){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN545-1 .apnf}

The connection of Hebrews 8:2 with the similar Greek and Aramaic
biblical traditions of Numbers 24:6 is enhanced by noticing that it also
is a 'tabernacle' that is 'in the heavens' (Heb. 8:1--2; so also 8:5;
9:24), in which Christ the 'high priest . . . has taken His seat at the
right hand of the throne of the Majesty'. This notion of kingship, like
that echoed in Numbers 24, is possibly related to the epistle's earlier
portrayal of Christ as the inaugural fulfilment of everything Adam
should have been as a human vice-regent over creation (Heb. 2:6--9).
This portrayal is based on the ideal Adam passage of Psalm 8. This
connection to Hebrews 2 may be enhanced by noticing that the earlier
Adamic depiction leads directly into the first discussion in the epistle
of Christ as a 'high priest' (2:10--17). Could this echo the pattern
that we have seen in Genesis 1 -- 2, where Adam is first portrayed as a
'king' (1:26--28) and then as a priestly figure, ruling and worshipping
in a temple
(Gen. 2:15)?[13](#appen11.html#NFIN546){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN546-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, the earlier discussion in Hebrews 2 also identifies him not
only as a priest but as ruling over evil (2:14) and as having God as his
Father, implying his sonship (cf. 2:11 with 7:28 -- 8:2).

Consequently, Christ is the priest-king whose resurrection was the
beginning of the latter-day temple and whose ascent into heaven meant
that the temple's centre of gravity had shifted from earth to heaven,
and would remain there during the present age. Christ as a priest-king
continues reigning and ministering within the heavenly temple-palace.

## []{#chap9.html#page_300}Christ as the veil of the heavenly end-time tabernacle {.int_niv1}

Interestingly, the author of Hebrews also identifies Christ with the
veil of the temple: believers can 'enter the holy place by the blood of
Jesus' that is 'a new and living way which He inaugurated for us
*through the veil, that is, His flesh . . .*' (Heb. 10:19--20). As a
'great priest over the house of God' (Heb. 10:21), Jesus has cleared the
way for his people to enter into and dwell in the true, heavenly 'Holy
of Holies' (cf. also Heb. 9:11, 24). Might this be comparable to Mark
15:29 and 38--39? While debatable, if the analysis of the chiasm there
was correct, the crucifixion of Jesus' body was interpreted to be the
'rending of the temple veil', and resulted in a Gentile being ushered
into God's presence, formerly limited to the holy of
holies.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN547){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN547-1 .apnf} Could
this also be a metaphorical equivalent of referring to Christ as the
beginning of the new creation (the 'new and living way'), as Paul and
John explicitly state (so 2 Cor. 5:14--17; Gal. 6:15--16; Col. 1:18;
Rev. 3:14)?[15](#appen11.html#NFIN548){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN548-1 .apnf}
Together with 'new', the word 'living' (*zōsan*) refers to resurrection
life in the age to come, both words underscoring the notion of new
creation.

Indeed, the next mention after 10:19 of Jesus' sacrificial 'blood' is in
Hebrews 13:12, which is inextricably linked to the way to the 'lasting
city . . . to come' (13:14) and to the new creation by resurrection:
'God . . . who brought up from the dead' Christ 'through the blood of
the eternal covenant' (13:20). The Old Testament's and early Jewish
tradition's view of the veil as representing the heavenly cosmos may
have sparked the thought of comparing Christ's work of new creation to
entering through the veil of his own flesh. Believers who identify with
the resurrected Jesus as an inaugurated new creation enter into God's
holy of holies' presence, which can dwell only in a perfected new
creation. Their only access to the new creation, and hence the divine
presence, is through Jesus.

That Christ was a priest in performing this work may merely be a mixed
metaphor (Heb. 10:20--22 portrays Christ as sacrifice, veil and priest).
Alternatively, it may reflect the earlier notion implicit in the Old
Testament and developed explicitly in Judaism that, just as the temple
symbolized the world, so the priest was an even more miniature symbol of
the cosmos, representing at the same time the
[]{#chap9.html#page_301}temple.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN549){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN549-1
.apnf} This earlier tradition was possibly responsible for the later
midrashic idea that 'the temple corresponds to the whole world and to
the creation of man who is a small
world'.[17](#appen11.html#NFIN550){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN550-1 .apnf}
Perhaps, the unspoken rationale bridging the portrayal of Christ as a
'veil' and 'priest' may be the fact that both were symbols of the
cosmos; accordingly, Christ is the inauguration of the new cosmos,
providing 'a *new* and *living* way'. Though the main point of these
verses is the new access into God's presence through the priestly work
of Jesus, the association of his work with the new inbreaking creation
may not be out of sight. Thus, Christ's priestly work of sacrifice is so
closely tied to his resurrection as new life, that they are almost two
sides of one coin.

In fact, this preceding discussion is consistent with the idea that
Christ as the last Adam, king and high priest represents true humanity
(Heb. 2:6--17), implying that, as a new Adam figure, he has inaugurated
a new world. In this respect, we have seen above that the conception of
Christ as the ultimate Adam and priest-king from Hebrews 2:6--17 may lie
behind Hebrews 8:1, where Christ is referred to as a 'high priest' and
king ruling 'at the right hand of the throne'.

## Christ as the heavenly end-time tabernacle itself {.int_niv1}

Similar to Hebrews 10:19--20, Hebrews 9:11 asserts that Christ as a
priest entered 'through the greater and more complete tabernacle, not
made with hands, that is to say not of this creation'. Verse 12 adds
that he entered 'through his own blood', thus equating the 'tabernacle'
with Jesus' blood'. Here again we have an identification of the
tabernacle of the new creation with Christ himself (here 'his
blood').[18](#appen11.html#NFIN551){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN551-1 .apnf}

## 'Mount Zion' and the 'Heavenly Jerusalem' as equivalent to the end-time temple {.int_niv1}

The theme of the temple in Hebrews appears to undergo further
development in chapters 12 and 13. The author contrasts God's visible
revelation at Mount Sinai that caused fear (12:18--21) with
[]{#chap9.html#page_302}his new revelation at 'Mount Zion' and 'the
heavenly Jerusalem' (12:22--29):

::: cita
^22^But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,
the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, ^23^to the general
assembly and church of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to
God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,

^24^and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled
blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.

^25^See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those
did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less
shall we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.

^26^And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying,
'Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.'

^27^And this expression, 'Yet once more,' denotes the removing of those
things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that those
things which cannot be shaken may remain. ^28^Therefore, since we
receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by
which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;

^29^for our God is a consuming fire.
:::

Though there is no explicit mention of 'temple' or 'sanctuary', the
concept is implied, as the passage uses an Old Testament phrase
sometimes synonymous for Israel's temple, 'Mount Zion'. Verses 18--21
contrast Mount Sinai with the heavenly Mount Zion. We saw in chapter 3
that Mount Sinai was conceived of as a mountain temple, so that Hebrews
12 may serve to contrast the earthly and heavenly temples. Believers
need to utilize their 'faith eyes' to realize that they have begun to
come to the heavenly temple on Mount Zion, regardless of where they may
be located on the old physical earth. 'Mount Zion' appears to be roughly
equivalent to the 'kingdom which cannot be shaken' that believers
'receive', in verse 28. The closest Old Testament parallel to verse 28
is Daniel 7:17, where the saints 'will receive the kingdom' (Ellingworth
1993: 689), and is itself a further development of Daniel 2:44: 'the God
of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed . . . it
will itself endure forever'. This eternal kingdom in Daniel 2 is
pictured in verse 45 as the 'stone' that 'became
[]{#chap9.html#page_303}a great mountain and filled the whole earth'
(2:35), and is contrasted with ungodly kingdoms that are pictured as a
statue that has been smashed to dust (2:31--35). Since we have already
observed associations of the Daniel 2 mountain with the eschatological
temple,[19](#appen11.html#NFIN552){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN552-1 .apnf}
Hebrews 12:22--29 may well be alluding to this Daniel background.

Furthermore, verse 22 equates 'Mount Zion' with 'the heavenly
Jerusalem', which itself must surely be associated with the 'heavenly
tabernacle' elsewhere in Hebrews (Heb. 8:1--2, 5; 9:24). Indeed, we will
see that in Revelation 21:2--3 the heavenly Jerusalem -- a metaphor for
God's redeemed people -- is equated with God's end-time 'tabernacle'.
Similarly, here we have the heavenly Jerusalem directly associated with
the redeemed from all ages (Heb. 12:23).

### The prophecy of the latter-day temple from Haggai 2 as the background for Hebrews 12:26--27 {.int_niv2}

Another reference to the temple in the concluding portion of Hebrews 12
comes in verses 26--27, which quotes from Haggai 2:6, and suggests
further that the idea of an end-time temple has already been in mind in
the preceding verses. The passage from Haggai is part of a prophecy
about the glory of the latter-day temple (Hag. 2:3--9):

::: cita
^3^'Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory? And
how do you see it now? Does it not seem to you like nothing in
comparison?

^4^'But now take courage, Zerubbabel,' declares the L[ORD]{.small},
'take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all
you people of the land take courage,' declares the L[ORD]{.small}, 'and
work; for I am with you,' []{#chap9.html#page_304}says the
L[ORD]{.small} of hosts.

^5^'As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt, My
Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear!'

^6^'For thus says the L[ORD]{.small} of hosts, 'Once more in a little
while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and
the dry land.

^7^'And I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth
of all nations; and I will fill this house with glory,' says the
L[ORD]{.small} of hosts.

^8^'The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,' declares the
L[ORD]{.small} of hosts.

^9^'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,'
says the L[ORD]{.small} of hosts, 'and in this place I shall give
peace,' declares the L[ORD]{.small} of hosts.
:::

We have had occasion to comment on Haggai 2 in an earlier
chapter,[20](#appen11.html#NFIN553){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN553-1 .apnf} and
it will be helpful here to revisit that discussion. The 'promise'
referred to in Haggai 2:5 is likely that made in Exodus 33:14--17:

::: cita
^14^And He said, 'My presence shall go \[with you\], and I will give you
rest.' ^15^Then he \[Moses\] said to Him, ^16^ ' . . . how then can it
be known that I have found favor in Thy sight, I and Thy people? Is it
not by Thy going with us, so that we . . . may be distinguished from all
the \[other\] people who are upon the face of the earth?' ^17^And the
L[ORD]{.small} said to Moses, 'I will also do this thing of which you
have spoken . . .' (so also Exod. 34:9)
:::

Haggai may also have in mind Exodus 19:5--6: 'you shall be My own
possession among all the peoples . . . you shall be to Me a kingdom of
priests . . .' In any case, the entire nation was to live in the midst
of God's presence, so that they all would become like priests before God
in his temple, being intermediaries between God and the unbelieving
nations.

Therefore, Haggai 2 refers to a future time when God will enable his
people to build his temple through the power of his
Spirit,[21](#appen11.html#NFIN554){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN554-1 .apnf} which
is to be a fulfilment of the promises in Exodus 33 and the promissory
commission in Exodus 19. In other words, Haggai 2 interprets the
promises in the two Exodus texts to be that of building God's
eschatological temple among his people. Though the temple rebuilding
project looked insignificant in comparison to the earlier Solomonic
temple, nevertheless God promises to make 'the latter glory of this
house . . . greater than the former' (Hag. 2:3--9). Since the actual,
subsequent rebuilding and expansion of the second temple did not excel
the glory of the Solomonic temple or fulfil the expectation of Ezekiel's
prophesied, eschatological temple (see Ezek. 40 -- 48) because of
Israel's disobedience (e.g., Zech. 6:15), intertestamental Judaism
naturally and rightly waited for the time when this would happen.

According to Haggai 2:6, the fulfilment of this promise would be in the
new creation, when 'once more in a little while' God will 'shake
[]{#chap9.html#page_305}the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the
dry land'. Though this language of cosmic upheaval is often figurative
in the Old Testament for destruction of particular nations, here it
probably refers to the actual breakup of the old creation. This is
likely how Hebrews understands the verse 'And this expression, "Yet once
more", denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of
created things, in order that those things which cannot be shaken may
remain' (Heb. 12:27). At the least, some kind of radical transformation
of the old world-system will occur to make way for the establishment of
an eternal, unchanging and new order. This fits well with the theme that
the true tabernacle was 'not made with \[human\] hands, that is to say,
not of this \[old\] creation' (Heb. 9:11).

That Haggai 2:9 concludes by saying that 'the latter glory of this house
will be greater than the former' also dovetails with the notion in
Hebrews that the 'new' and 'true' tabernacle is 'greater and more
perfect' than the first one (cf. Heb. 9:1--11, 24; cf. 10:20). God has
'taken away the first' system of temple sacrifices and offerings (and
hence has removed the temple along with them) 'in order to establish the
second' eschatological institution of Christ's once-for-all-sacrifice in
the newly inaugurated temple (Heb. 10:9). The reason for this is that
the new temple reality is a part of the 'new covenant', which is 'a
better covenant' because it 'has been enacted on better promises' than
the 'first' (Heb. 8:6--7, 13), Mosaic covenant. The new covenant temple
is likewise 'better and greater' than the old one because the former is
'unshakeable', permanent and eternal. It is unchangeable and never
fading because it is made by God's immutable hand as a new creation.

That the author of Hebrews has in mind the latter-day temple in the
context of Haggai 2 is evident from noticing that another Old Testament
temple allusion appears to lead from the Haggai quotation in Hebrews
12:26--27 to the mention in verse 28 of 'receiving a kingdom which
cannot be shaken', wherein people 'offer to God an acceptable service'.

::: cita
Worship the Lord in his holy court, let all the earth be shaken before
him. Say to the nations, 'The Lord has inaugurated his reign,' for he
will complete the \[heavenly\] world, which will not be shaken.
([LXX]{.small} of Psalm 95 \[96\]:9--10; cf. also vv. 6--7 on the temple
context)[22](#appen11.html#NFIN555){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN555-1 .apnf}
:::

[]{#chap9.html#page_306}Therefore, Hebrews 12:22--28 says that believers
have begun to participate in an unshakeable mountain, temple and
kingdom, which are different images for the same one reality of God's
glorious kingship in a new creation.

::: {#chap9.html#niv2-089 .niv2}
### Those identified with the end-time temple will perform priestly service and be at peace {.int_niv2}

In response to their inclusion in God's unshakeable kingdom and temple,
Christians are to 'show gratitude' by performing the priestly duty of
'offering to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe' (12:28).
Hebrews 13:15--16 observes that the believer's priestly service also
includes 'offering up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit
of the lips', and 'doing good and sharing; for with such sacrifices God
is pleased'. Such a priestly manner of living is appropriate for those
who 'do not have a lasting city' on this old earth but 'are seeking the
\[consummated form of the\] city which is to come', in which they have
begun to share in its inaugurated form (Heb. 13:14).

The entire concluding section of chapter 12 (vv. 18--29) serves as a
basis for verses 14--17, the main point of which is 'Pursue after peace
with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the
Lord' (v. 14), and 'that no one comes short of the grace of God' (v.
15). The main point of verses 18--29 is 'offering to God an acceptable
service' (v. 28) because believers 'receive a kingdom \[and temple\]
which cannot be shaken', which is based primarily on Haggai 2:6--7. Just
as the temple prophecy of Haggai 2 concludes with its main point ('in
this place \[the end-time temple\] I shall give peace', v. 9b), Hebrews
directs believers to 'offer to God an acceptable \[priestly\] service'
(v. 28) by 'pursuing peace . . . and . . . sanctification' (v. 14)
because they serve in the end-time heavenly temple that extends to earth
(vv. 26--28a).

Verse 15 expands the exhortation of 'pursuing peace' (v. 14) by stating,
'See to it that . . . no root of bitterness springing up causes
trouble'. Verses 16--17 then adduce Esau as an example of someone who
was characterized by just such bitterness. Esau is faulted because he
lived by sight and not faith; he could not wait for and trust in the
blessing of the coming Abrahamic inheritance. Instead, he 'sold his own
birthright for a single meal' because he wanted to possess what he could
see and enjoy in the present, and could not believe and wait for his
unseen future inheritance.

In contrast, God's true people, like Abraham and Jacob, live by faith in
the future, unseen Zion, temple and kingdom (Heb. 11:13--16).
[]{#chap9.html#page_307}They will 'pursue peace' and not be bitter when
they do not experience material blessings in the present, even when what
they own in this world is wrongly taken away from them. The author of
Hebrews comforted his readers with the knowledge that they had 'accepted
joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for
yourselves a better possession and an abiding one' (Heb. 10:34). Their
'way of life' is to be 'free from the love of money, being content with
what' they have because God has promised them, 'I will never desert you,
nor will I ever forsake you' (Heb. 13:5). What can one possess that is
more valuable than God's presence? The climax of that promise is their
possession of Zion and the new creation, wherein they will live in God's
presence eternally (Heb. 12:22--29; Rev. 21:4--5).

Consequently, believers can 'confidently say, "The Lord is my helper, I
will not be afraid. What shall man do to me?"' (Heb. 13:6). Wanting to
have a strong grasp on things in the old creation is ultimately vain,
since these things are 'shakeable' and will eventually perish. The focus
should be on the invisible Zion, Jerusalem, temple and new creation,
which have broken in from the future into this old age. Christians have
begun to share in this inaugurated reality that will be consummated at
Christ's final coming in the future (Heb. 9:28). It is this in which we
are to have faith.

Such an uncovetous lifestyle will free believers to 'pursue peace' and
not be 'bitter' when their rights in the old world are trampled on. The
outcome of such living will be 'sanctification' (Heb. 12:14) and not
being 'defiled' (Heb. 12:15). These, indeed, are requirements for
holiness to qualify one for priestly service, which point towards the
following section on the believers' beginning participation in Zion,
Jerusalem and the temple (Heb. 12:22--28). These priestly qualifications
are expanded, as we have seen, in 12:28 and 13:10--15, where the
priestly activities of all God's people are elaborated. In the light of
the notion of 'peace' mentioned so far, it is not accidental that
Hebrews concludes with a prayer to the 'God of peace' (Heb. 13:20--21).

Peace was to be the main mark of the expected new creation that was
foreseen by the Old Testament prophets. Isaiah's well-known prophecy of
the new heavens and earth include the image of antagonistic animals of
the old creation lying peacefully with one another (Is. 65:17--25; see
also Is. 11:6--9). The point of Isaiah's depiction is to underscore that
the crown of creation, formerly alienated as Jews and Gentiles, will be
at peace with one another (Is. 11:9--12). In fact, Gentiles even will
become Levitical priests (Is. 66:18--22; so also Is. 56:3--8)!

[]{#chap9.html#page_308}The Isaiah background is relevant since
Isaiah 66:22 ('the new heavens and the new earth which I make will
endure') is echoed in Hebrews 12:26--27, 'I will shake not only the
earth, but also the heaven . . . as of created things, in order that
those things which cannot be shaken may remain.' This earlier echo may
anticipate the clear allusion to Isaiah 63:11 here in 13:20:

Now, Jesus is the greater Moses whom God has delivered from death at the
greater exodus, along with his
people.[24](#appen11.html#NFIN557){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN557-1 .apnf} And
just as the exodus was thought of as a new
creation,[25](#appen11.html#NFIN558){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN558-1 .apnf} so
it is followed by the even more monumental new exodus and creation of
Jesus' resurrection. Just as the first exodus was to lead to the
establishment of the temporary temple (e.g., Exod. 15:17 and Is. 63:18),
so Isaiah 63:15 ('Look down from heaven, and see from Thy holy . . .
habitation') and 64:1 ('Oh, that Thou wouldst rend the heavens and come
down') prophesy that the second, end-time exodus (Is. 63:11) will also
lead to God's heavenly sanctuary descending to earth and residing
permanently. As Hebrews has recounted in earlier chapters, Jesus has led
his people to that heavenly mountain-tabernacle (cf. Heb. 6:19--20;
9:11--12, 23--24; 10:19--22; 12:22--24). Hence, the quotation of
Isaiah 63:11 in Hebrews 13:20 may not be too distant in theme from the
heavenly temple themes that we have discussed in the previous pages.

Only the 'God of peace' can give to his people the ability 'to do his
will' by 'pursuing peace' and thus 'pleasing' him. But he gives this
ability only to 'sheep' who are identified with the resurrected 'great
Shepherd' and have begun to experience the resurrection power of
[]{#chap9.html#page_309}their Lord in 'the eternal covenant'. In fact,
resurrection in the New Testament is the beginning act of new creation,
so that it is natural that it would be mentioned here together with 'the
eternal covenant'. An unshakeable relationship with God can be attained
only within the sphere of this 'eternal covenant' and new creation,
wherein also is 'Mount Zion', 'the heavenly Jerusalem', the 'true
tabernacle' and the 'kingdom'. All of these are equivalent realities,
which are aimed at achieving God's 'glory forever and ever'
(Heb. 13:21b).

## Excursus: further biblical-theological reflections related to Hebrews' contention that the eternal end-time temple cannot be 'handmade' {.int_niv1}

It was noted earlier in this chapter that there may have been possible
additional reasons from other biblical books that could have formed part
of the background for the author of Hebrews' thinking about the temple.
To some extent, these notions could have shaped the author's belief
about the latter-day, literal temple not being like Israel's old
physical one but being the heavenly one.

We have stated most of these ideas at various points in earlier chapters
but they bear repeating here in one place. Even if Hebrews does not have
these ideas explicitly in mind, they nevertheless form the broader
biblical conception of why the eschatological temple could not be
human-made.

The essential meaning of Israel's temple was that it represented the
glorious presence of God that was revealed more fully in the holy of
holies than anywhere else on earth. God's glorious presence, however,
could be only incompletely expressed because it was contained within a
human-made structure. This, as we have seen, is part of Stephen's point
in Acts 7:48--49: 'the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human
hands; as the prophet says,/"Heaven is My throne/ And earth is the
footstool of My feet;/What kind of ho'use will you build for Me?" says
the Lord;/"Or what place is there for My repose?/Was it not My hand
which made all these things?"'

Israel's physical temples were 'handmade' (Acts 7:44--47) and could
never be a permanent dwelling place for God. We have seen that Stephen's
point in citing Isaiah 66:1 appears to demonstrate that, just as God's
own hand created the first cosmos that had become tainted with
idolatry,[26](#appen11.html#NFIN559){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN559-1 .apnf} so
God would create a new, eternal creation and
[]{#chap9.html#page_310}Jerusalem, not by human hands but by his own
hand (so Is. 65:17--19 and 66:22). This is why even Solomon's temple was
not the ultimate fulfilment of the promise that David's son would build
God a temple -- because Solomon's temple was 'handmade'. Not only was a
humanmade structure an inappropriate container for God's presence, but
Israel made her temples objects of idolatry. Just as Israel had
constructed 'the tabernacle of Moloch' during their wilderness sojourn,
so also Israel set up idolatrous images in the later Solomonic temple (2
Kgs. 16:10--16; 21:4--9; 23:4--12). Likewise, the second temple had
become idolatrous, since Israel had supplanted their tradition for God
himself. The temple became the central focus of their idolatry (cf. Rom.
2:22).

As we saw earlier in our discussion of the Gospels, Jesus' so-called
'cleansing' of the temple possibly points further to his task of
replacing the old temple with a new one (Matt. 21:12--13 and parallels).
The reason for this was that the Jews had made the temple into an
economic enterprise instead of a place of worship. Jesus' radical act in
the temple was an acted-out parable of judgment on the temple, not only
because of its misuse but because of Israel's rejection of God's word
and commandments and of Jesus himself (N. T. Wright 1996:413--427). The
religious establishment superstitiously viewed the temple as a guarantee
that God would guard and prosper the nation despite their disobedience
to his will. They did not understand that God had designed the temple to
be a rallying point and witness for the
Gentiles.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN560){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN560-1 .apnf}
Such rejection was tantamount to idolatry (see Mark 7:1--13). As a
result, Israel's temples had to be destroyed since this was the divine
judgment on other idolatrous objects (e.g., Exod. 34:14; Deut. 7:5; 2
Kgs. 23:14; 2 Chr. 31:1; 34:4).

We have also proposed earlier that the end-time stone-mountain of Daniel
2 was a temple image. The main reasons suggesting this identification
were twofold: that Daniel's image contained descriptions similar to
Solomon's temple and the latter-day temple, and that both Daniel's
mountain and the eschatological temple are said not to be made by human
hands.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN561){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN561-1 .apnf} The
New Testament repeatedly refers to the new, end-time temple as 'not made
with hands' (in addition to Acts 7:48, see Mark 14:58; 2 Cor. 5:1;
Heb. 9:11, 24). The image in the Old Testament corresponding closest to
this is Daniel's stone 'cut out without hands'. We have found that it
may not be surprising that []{#chap9.html#page_311}Christ identifies
himself with the stone of Daniel, which is an apparent attempt to
designate himself to be the true temple (Luke 20:17--18 = Matt. 21:42).
Furthermore, Hebrews 9:11 says that Christ entered 'through the greater
and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is say, not of
this creation' (so also
Heb. 9:24).[29](#appen11.html#NFIN562){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN562-1 .apnf}

Accordingly, Acts 17:24 affirms that 'The God who made the world and all
things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in
temples made with hands'. Paul says this after the great
redemptive-historical divide when Christ and his people had begun to
replace Israel's 'handmade' temple. There could be no humanmade
structures separating God and his people in order that he might dwell
with them in a full and unrestricted manner. This would appear to be the
reason that no human can answer affirmatively God's question in
Isaiah 66:1 about his latter-day, eternal dwelling, 'Where then is a
house you could build for Me?'

God's intention is one day to fill every part of his creation with his
presence because he is the Creator. God's holy presence could not dwell
universally in any handmade localized structure nor, indeed, could he
dwell fully in any part of the sin-tainted old creation. Hence, his
special tabernacling presence dwelt in a limited manner within
human-made structures. However, when he would fully redeem the world and
recreate it (so Rom. 8:18--25), he would dwell in it more fully than
ever before. Consequently, the new temple would be an eternal and
perfect abode for God's universal presence because it would not be 'made
with hands, that is to say, not of this \[old\] creation' (Heb. 9:11),
and without moral blemish. This is why John says in Revelation 21:22, 'I
saw no \[structural\] temple' in the new cosmos because 'the Lord God,
the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple'. The former temples that
were imperfect dwellings for God's presence 'are replaced by God and the
Lamb in person, so that unrestricted dealings with God are
possible'.[30](#appen11.html#NFIN563){#chap9.html#ap_NFIN563-1 .apnf}

As discussed earlier, we may assume that God created the cosmos to be
his great temple, in which he rested after his creative work.
Nevertheless, his special revelatory presence did not fill the entire
earth yet, since it was his intention that his human vice-regent, whom
he installed in the garden sanctuary, would extend worldwide the
[]{#chap9.html#page_312}boundaries of that sanctuary and of God's
presence. Adam, of course, disobeyed this mandate, so that humanity no
longer enjoyed God's presence in the little localized garden.
Consequently, the entire earth became infected with sin and idolatry in
a way it had not been previously before the fall, while yet in its still
imperfect newly created state. Therefore, the various expressions about
God being unable to inhabit earthly structures are best understood, at
least in part, by realizing that the old order and sanctuary have been
tainted with sin and must be cleansed and recreated before God's
Shekinah presence, formerly limited to heaven and the holy of holies,
can dwell universally throughout creation.

The preceding study so far has contended that the various forms of the
temple in the Old Testament were intended to point to the final
eschatological goal of God's presence filling the entire creation in the
way it had formerly filled only the holy of holies. While I believe that
this thesis about the ultimate redemptive-historical significance of the
temple is plausible, I am sure that there are some, perhaps many, who
would doubt the probability of it. When, however, we come to the New
Testament, there are passages that fit admirably into such a scheme. I
have tried to show in preceding chapters how this is so. Some of the
clearest evidence for the thesis, however, is in John's Apocalypse,
particularly, for our purposes, Revelation 11:1--4 and Revelation 21:1
-- 22:5, though the entire book is filled with the theme of the
temple.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN564){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN564-1 .apnf}
Likewise, 1 Peter 2 testifies to the same reality, which will confirm
our conclusions about Revelation. First, I give an analysis of 11:1--4,
then I briefly discuss 1 Peter 2 together with a couple of other
passages in Revelation, and, finally, I relate both more intentionally
to the concluding vision of the
Apocalypse.[2](#appen11.html#NFIN565){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN565-1 .apnf}

## The church as the eschatological temple in Revelation 11:1--4 {.int_niv1}

Revelation 11:1--2 is a minefield of problems:

::: cita
And there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said,
'Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who
worship in it. And leave out the court which is outside the temple, and
do not measure it, for it has []{#chap10.html#page_314}been given to the
nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two
months.'
:::

Space allows only a brief review of the alternative interpretations and
my preference, support of which can be found elsewhere (e.g. Beale
1999a: *in loc.*). Some believe the reference is to a physical temple
structure to be built in the eschatological future, while others see a
similar temple building of the past that was destroyed in [AD]{.small}
70. There are also those, however, who see a non-structural temple
composed of believing (= the inner court) and unbelieving (= outer
court) ethnic Israelites that will exist in the future, directly
preceding Christ's coming. Still others understand the image similarly
but see it as a reality existing throughout the church age. Accordingly,
the inner court represents true believers and the outer court
pseudo-Christians.

I prefer a variant of this last view. I would contend, however, that
this is not a 'figurative' view but that, whereas God's unique
tabernacling presence in Israel was manifested in the physical temple,
this same unique presence manifests itself in the midst of God's true
people, the church. God's literal presence as the essence of Israel's
physical temple now abides in the midst of the church as the true
temple.

The inner court stands for true, spiritual Israel, while the outer court
represents the physical bodies of God's true people, which are
susceptible to harm. This is consistent with the notion that the outer
court of the Old Testament temple represented the physical aspect of
creation. This view of Revelation 11:1--2 is linguistically allowable
because the language of 'casting outside' can also have the nuance of
God's true people who are rejected and persecuted by the unbelieving
world.[3](#appen11.html#NFIN566){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN566-1 .apnf} The
significance of the measuring means that their salvation is secured,
despite physical harm. This is a further development of the 'sealing' of
7:2--8 and is consistent with *1 Enoch* 61:1--5, where the angelic
'measuring' of the righteous elect ensures that their faith will be
strengthened and not demolished, despite the fact that their bodies will
be destroyed. In the Old Testament generally, 'measuring' was
metaphorical for a decree of
protection.[4](#appen11.html#NFIN567){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN567-1 .apnf}

### []{#chap10.html#page_315}The church as the eschatological temple in Revelation 11:1--4 against the background of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 {.int_niv2}

The 'measuring' is best understood against the background, not of the
first-century Herodian temple, but the prophecy of the temple in Ezekiel
40 -- 48.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN568){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN568-1 .apnf} We
will summarize how we see John utilizing Ezekiel's temple prophecy in
this section, but we will wait until the next chapter to give an
in-depth study of Ezekiel itself, where we will also elaborate further
on John's use in Revelation 21 and 22.

An angel measuring various features of the temple complex in Ezekiel 40
-- 48 metaphorically pictures the sure establishment and subsequent
protection of the
temple.[6](#appen11.html#NFIN569){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN569-1 .apnf} In
Revelation 21:15--17 an angel, also in dependence on the same Ezekiel
text, '*measures* with a *reed'* (*metreō* + *kalamos*, as in 11:1) 'the
city and its gates and its wall'. There the measuring of the city and
its parts pictures the security of its inhabitants against the harm and
contamination of unclean and deceptive people (so 21:27). This cordoning
off of the city guarantees protection of God's latter-day community.
Jewish and Gentile Christians will compose this temple community (as is
evident from 3:12; 21:12--14, 24--26; 22:2). What is figuratively
established by the measuring in Ezekiel and Revelation 21 is the
infallible promise of God's future presence, which will dwell for ever
in the midst of 'a purified cult and purified community' (Wevers 1969:
295--296).

In Revelation 11, the 'measuring' connotes God's presence which is
guaranteed to be with the temple community living on earth before the
consummation of history. This means that the faith of God's people will
be upheld by his presence, since without faith there can be no divine
presence. No outside aberrant theological or ethical influences will be
able to spoil or contaminate the true faith or worship of God's true
people. In Revelation 11 this means that the fulfilment of the promise
about God's end-time presence begins with the establishment of the
Christian community in the first century. The command to measure is to
be viewed from God's perspective as representing a decree already
enacted prior to the issuing of the command. Even before the church age
began, God made a decree, which secured the salvation of all people who
would become genuine members of the church. The same conclusion is
applicable to the meaning of the []{#chap10.html#page_316}'sealing' in
7:3--8 (see Beale 1999a: *in loc.*). Therefore, the two metaphors of
'measuring' and 'sealing' connote synonymous theological
concepts.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN570){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN570-1 .apnf}

The fact that the temple prophesied in Ezekiel 40 -- 48 includes a
sacrificial system should not be understood to be physically literal but
interpreted in the light of Hebrews 10:1--12 (see below). The reason
that the Ezekiel expectation is interpreted as beginning fulfilment in a
perhaps somewhat unexpected way is because of Christ's death, which has
caused the redemptive-historical turn of the ages. Christ's work is now
the dominant interpretative lens through which to understand Old
Testament expectations. In Revelation 11:1--2 the temple of the church
is being patterned after Christ, who is the true
temple.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN571){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN571-1 .apnf} Just
as Christ, so the church will suffer and appear defeated. Nevertheless,
through it all, God's presence will abide with them and protect them
from any contamination leading to eternal death. God's abiding presence
also guarantees them ultimate victory. On the other hand, this is not
that surprising of a fulfilment when we remember that the Old Testament
temple's tripartite structure ultimately indicated that God's presence
in the inner sanctuary would eventually invade and take over the entire
earth. Christ is that divine presence which has begun to invade the
space--time creation.

Though *naos* ('sanctuary') can sometimes refer to the whole temple
complex (Matt. 26:61; 27:5; John 2:20), here it has reference to the
inner sanctuary or inside house, where only the priests were allowed
(which appears to be its meaning in the other approximately 13 uses in
the book). Some commentators think the 'temple' to be metaphorical for
Christians, and another way of speaking of them as true Israel. This is
generally correct. The phrase 'temple of God' in the Old Testament
referred to that place where God's presence uniquely dwelt on
earth.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN572){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN572-1 .apnf} In the
prophecy of the new temple in Ezekiel 40 -- 48 (especially 43:1--12;
37:26--28), God promised that his presence would be re-established for
ever. In Revelation 11:1 the focus is now on the whole covenant
community forming a spiritual temple in which God's presence
dwells.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN573){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN573-1 .apnf} This
is not so much a figurative perspective nor merely a spiritual
interpretation of Ezekiel's temple
prophecy.[11](#appen11.html#NFIN574){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN574-1 .apnf} It
is also a redemptive-historical understanding. There is a literal
[]{#chap10.html#page_317}spiritual realm and a literal physical realm.
What Ezekiel prophesied has begun to find its real, true fulfilment on a
literal spiritual level, which will be consummated in fuller form
physically and spiritually in a new creation (see on Rev. 21:1 -- 22:5).

Already in John 2:19--22 Christ has identified his resurrection body as
the true temple and this is developed in Revelation 21:22 (likewise Mark
12:10--11 and par.). There John says he 'saw no temple' in the new
Jerusalem 'for the Lord God . . . and the Lamb, are its temple'. There
is no reason to limit this identification to the future new Jerusalem,
since the identification began to be made when Christ was resurrected,
and the resurrected Christ is the central feature of the heavenly temple
scene in 1:12--20 (likewise, Eph. 2:20 pictures Christ as the
cornerstone of the temple).

Therefore, Christians who are identified with Christ are also presently
identified with the temple. The New Testament elsewhere also portrays
the church as the new spiritual temple, as we have
seen.[12](#appen11.html#NFIN575){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN575-1 .apnf}
Without exception *naos* elsewhere in Revelation refers to the heavenly
temple of the
present[13](#appen11.html#NFIN576){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN576-1 .apnf} or
the temple of God's presence that dominates the cosmos of the
future.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN577){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN577-1 .apnf} This
usage points to the same identification of a heavenly temple in 11:1--2:
the people of God who are members of God's temple in heaven are referred
to in their existence on earth as 'the temple of God'. Indeed, the only
other use of the phrase 'temple of God' in the book appears in 11:19
with reference to the end-time *heavenly* temple, which is the same
reality having protected believers during their sojourn on earth.

Not coincidentally, the temple of the Old Testament was conceived of as
providing a link between heaven and
earth.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN578){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN578-1 .apnf}
Revelation 11:1--2 depicts the temple of the age to come as having
broken into the present age. If one insists on identifying the sanctuary
in 11:1--2 as the earthly temple structure instead of the invisible and
heavenly, then one must assume that this is a completely unique
employment of that concept within the book (Bachmann 1994: 478). It
would also be a unique use of the word *naos* ('sanctuary') within the
book and in the New Testament outside the Gospels and Acts. Even when
*naos* occurs in the Gospels and Acts almost always it is in the context
of []{#chap10.html#page_318}the inadequacy of the physical temple and
its replacement by Christ or God's universal presence.

The specific precedent of understanding Ezekiel's prophesied temple not
to be a structural building, as in Revelation 11:1--2, is also found in
the Qumran community. Qumran declared the Jerusalem temple
apostate.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN579){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN579-1 .apnf}
They believed themselves to represent the true, spiritual
temple.[17](#appen11.html#NFIN580){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN580-1 .apnf} The
presence of God in the Qumran temple would ensure the invincibility of
it against the deceptive designs of Belial (4QFlor 1.7--9; CD
3.19).[18](#appen11.html#NFIN581){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN581-1 .apnf} This
spiritual invincibility is seen as a fulfilment of the prophecy of the
temple in Ezekiel
44\![19](#appen11.html#NFIN582){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN582-1 .apnf}
Metaphors of measurement are even used to express the inviolable
security of this
temple.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN583){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN583-1 .apnf}

As with the two witnesses in Revelation 11:3--7, so in Qumran, worship
in the spiritual temple consisted not of physical offerings, but of
proclaiming God's word and obedience out of a sincere heart (1QS 9.3--5;
4QFlor 1.6). After the destruction of the temple and its altar of
atonement, sincere commitment to the Lord and consecration of one's own
table by words of the Law were able to make atonement. This
spiritualization of the altar in the temple was based on analogy with
the temple altar in Ezekiel
41:22.[21](#appen11.html#NFIN584){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN584-1 .apnf} To
engage continually in the study of the Law was equivalent to building
the temple prophesied in Ezekiel 40 -- 47 (*Midrash Rabbah
Leviticus *7:3). Repentance could be 'accounted unto a person as if he
had . . . built the Temple and the altar, and offered thereon all the
sacrifices' (*Midrash Rabbah Leviticus *7:2). Part of the precedent for
Qumran and John conceptualizing Ezekiel's temple in a non-structural
manner and applying it to a remnant of Israel or to the church may have
been given by the prophet Ezekiel himself! Immediately after God's
presence departed from Israel's physical temple (see Ezek. 11:22--23),
he tells exiled Judah and Benjamin that this presence would be uniquely
among them, despite the fact there was no physical Israelite temple in
the exile: he would be 'a *sanctuary* for them a little while . . .'
(Ezek. []{#chap10.html#page_319}11:16). He continued to be such an
invisible sanctuary for the remnant after the return from Babylon, since
the second temple clearly did not fulfil the grand prophecies of
Israel's restoration, which included a greater temple than even
Solomon's. This invisible sanctuary became transmuted into Christ and
the church at the time of the escalated restoration at Christ's first
coming which would be consummated at his last coming.

Literally, *to thysiastērion* in Revelation 11:1 can be translated 'the
place of
sacrifice',[22](#appen11.html#NFIN585){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN585-1 .apnf}
which here would be the suffering covenant community. The 'altar' refers
to the way God's people now worship in the community. In line with
6:9--10 the altar connotes the sacrificial calling, which entails
suffering for their faithful witness (as affirmed by vv. 3--9; see on
6:9--10). The close proximity of believers to the altar in 6:9--10
implies that they are not only worshippers but also priests who have
brought themselves to be sacrificed on the altar of the gospel to which
they have been called to testify. The unusual picture of Christians
simultaneously portrayed as a temple and as priests worshipping in the
temple is found also in 1 Peter 2:5. Indeed, Revelation 1:6 and 5:10
allude to the same Old Testament text as 1 Peter 2:5 in identifying
Christians as priests (likewise, as we have seen, Christ himself is
portrayed as a priest, sacrifice and veil of the temple
\[Heb. 10:19--21\]). How this living temple on earth in 11:1--2 relates
to the other references in the book to the heavenly temple must be
clarified by later chapters of the Apocalypse. In brief, however, the
saints depicted in Revelation 11:1--2 are members of a heavenly
community who dwell on earth.

This view of *thysiastērion* is corroborated by its contextual use
elsewhere. As we saw in the preceding chapter, Hebrews 13:9--16 says
that believers have an altar (i.e., Christ) through which they offer up
sacrifices to God. Christians are exhorted not to be deceived by false
doctrine and not to place their hope in the impermanent 'city' of
Jerusalem, but to 'seek the city which is to come' and is already here
(cf. Heb. 12:22 and 13:14). They are to heed this exhortation by
focusing on the spiritual altar and by being willing to 'go out to Him
outside the camp (= temple and Jerusalem), bearing His reproach' (so
Heb. 8:1ff. and 10:19--20 speak of Christ being in the true temple and
that believers presently enter it through
him).[23](#appen11.html#NFIN586){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN586-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap10.html#page_320}'The ones worshipping in it \[the temple\]' in
Revelation 11:1b refers to believers worshipping together in the temple
community.[24](#appen11.html#NFIN587){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN587-1 .apnf}
Possibly the 'worshippers' in Revelation 11:1 are to be identified as
members of the heavenly court, though still living on earth, since
*proskuneō* ('worship') refers elsewhere in the book to the 'elders' in
heaven worshipping God: cf. 4:10; 5:14; 7:11; 11:16; 19:4 (cf. also
Heb. 12:22--23) (Giblin 1984: 455). An earthly location of the
'worshippers' is favoured by the immediate context of verses 1--2 and
broader context of verses 3--10, where the community of faith is
pictured on earth. Alternatively, the focus may be on people who have
been qualified to worship in heaven because of the measuring. This focus
is suggested in the near context (11:11--12) by three observations: (1)
the ultimate, heavenly destiny of the earthly community of believers,
(2) usage of 'worship' (*proskuneō*) elsewhere, and (3) Rev. 13:6, 'His
tabernacle, \[which are\] those who dwell in heaven.' Certainly, the
measuring of the 'worshippers' guarantees their membership in the
heavenly spiritual temple, despite what happens to them on
earth.[25](#appen11.html#NFIN588){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN588-1 .apnf}

### The view of the eschatological temple in Revelation 11:4 against the background of Zechariah 4 {.int_niv2}

Revelation 11:3--6 explains the primary purpose of 'measuring the
sanctuary' in verses 1--2. That is, God's establishment of his presence
among his latter-day community as his sanctuary is aimed to ensure the
effectiveness of their prophetic witness. Noting that the two witnesses
bear their testimony not only in earthly courts but also in an unseen
courtroom, as they are 'standing before the Lord of the earth',
intensifies the legal nature of the witness in verses 3--4. The Lord is
the earth's omniscient judge because his 'eyes . . . range to and
[]{#chap10.html#page_321}fro throughout the earth' (cf. Zech. 4:10, 14;
Rev. 5:6). The expression of the witnesses' close proximity to the Lord
also emphasizes their close relation to and commission by the Lord (cf.
Kraft 1974:157). This likewise means that, though the prophetic
witnesses live in a world of danger, they are never far from their
Lord's sovereign presence and nothing can separate them from their
secure relationship with him (cf. Prigent 1981:156--167). This idea
appears to be part of a larger conception, since in Judaism the notion
of 'standing before the Lord' connoted an eternally secure relationship
of the faithful with
God.[26](#appen11.html#NFIN589){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN589-1 .apnf} The
phrase was also commonly used in the Old Testament to refer to people
being in God's presence. Among these uses are numerous references in
Exodus and Leviticus to priests standing 'before the Lord' in the
tabernacle (Exod. 27:21; 30:8; Lev. 24:3). Together with Zechariah 4:14
(on which see below), Revelation 11:4b may also allude to
Leviticus 24:4, where 'the pure gold lampstand \[is\] before the Lord
continually'.

The witnesses are identified as 'the two olive trees and the two
lampstands'. The 'lampstands' refer to the church, since that was the
repeated meaning of the 'lampstands' in chapters 1 -- 2. It would be 'a
defiance of common sense to use the same distinctive symbol for two
different ideas, within the compass of one book' (Kiddle 1940: 181).

The lampstand in the tabernacle and temple was in the presence of God,
and the light that emanated from it apparently represented the presence
of God.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN590){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN590-1 .apnf}
Similarly, the lamps on the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2--5 are
interpreted in 4:6 as representing God's presence or Spirit, which was
to empower Israel (= 'the lampstand') to finish rebuilding the temple,
despite resistance (cf. Zech. 4:6--9). So new Israel, the church, as
God's spiritual temple on earth is to draw its power from the Spirit,
the divine presence, before God's throne in its drive to stand against
the resistance of the world. This continues the theme from verses 1--3
of God's establishment of his presence among
[]{#chap10.html#page_322}his end-time community as his sanctuary, which
is aimed to ensure the effectiveness of its prophetic
witness\![28](#appen11.html#NFIN591){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN591-1 .apnf}

The two pictures of olive trees and lampstands together with the
concluding clause of verse 4 come from Zechariah 4:14 (cf. 4:2--3,
11--14). In Zechariah's vision, the lampstand represented the second
temple[29](#appen11.html#NFIN592){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN592-1 .apnf} for
which Zerubbabel had laid the foundation (see Beale 1999a: *in loc.* on
1:13--15). On either side was an olive tree, which provided the oil to
light the lamps. The olive trees are interpreted as 'the two anointed
ones, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth' (v. 14). In
context, 'the anointed ones' likely refer to Joshua the high priest and
Zerubbabel the king.

The meaning of the entire vision of Zechariah 4 is summarized in
4:6--10. Though the temple building had begun, there was opposition from
hostile powers halting the completion of the construction ('the
mountain' of v. 7 probably represents forces hostile to the building of
the temple). The main point of Zechariah 4 is a divine assurance that
the opposition will be overcome and the temple completed: 'Not by
\[fleshly\] might nor by power, but by My Spirit' and manifold grace
(vv. 6--9). This would be true even though the initial construction
appeared inauspicious and the possibility of completion improbable in
view of the opposition (v. 10a). God would provide his fruitful Spirit
(the oil) and cause it to issue forth from the priest and king (the
olive trees) to lead the process of successfully completing the temple.
It is notable that the 'stone' of Zechariah 3:9 is associated with
'seven eyes', which are to be identified with the 'seven eyes of the
L[ORD]{.small}' in Zechariah 4:10. In both cases the eyes are
providentially watching over the foundation stone of the temple and
figuratively indicate that the laying of that stone was a divine
assurance that the temple will be completed.

This background shows the appropriateness of choosing Zechariah 4:14 at
this point in John's Apocalypse. Despite the fact that John creatively
uses Zechariah, it is a creative development that
[]{#chap10.html#page_323}does not violate the meaning in its original
context.[30](#appen11.html#NFIN593){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN593-1 .apnf} The
establishing and preservation of the true temple despite opposition has
been introduced in Revelation 11:1--2, and Zechariah 4:14 is a climax to
a section concerning the very same topic. Just as the priest and king
were the key vessels used by the Spirit for the establishment of the
temple against opposition, so here the two witnesses are likewise
empowered by the Spirit to perform the same role in relation to 11:1--2.
Similar to the situation of the temple in Zechariah 4, the spiritual
temple of God appears insignificant, perhaps especially since it is
invisible, and its destiny seems questionable because it is opposed by
worldly powers. The Aramaic Bible interprets the antagonistic 'mountain'
of the Hebrew text as Rome, which is one of the opponents John had in
view.[31](#appen11.html#NFIN594){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN594-1 .apnf}
Despite resistance, the Christian community's successful establishment
as God's temple throughout the church age is assured by means of the
Spirit's empowerment of the church's faithful, prophetic witness (see on
1:13--15; 19:10).

The allusion to Zechariah enforces the thought of the prophets'
empowerment by the Spirit, since the lamps of Zechariah 4 have already
been identified in 4:5 and 5:6 with God's
Spirit.[32](#appen11.html#NFIN595){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN595-1 .apnf}
Revelation 11:4 is a symbolic picture of the church's commission in
Acts 1:8. In contrast with Zechariah, the priestly and kingly figures
are not individuals but represent the church universal, the
eschatological continuation of true Israel. Indeed, the dual
kingly--priestly role of the corporate church has already been
explicitly affirmed (1:6; 5:10) and will be again (20:6). Similarly,
Judaism interpreted Zechariah 4:3, 11--14 as referring generally to
priestly and royal
figures,[33](#appen11.html#NFIN596){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN596-1 .apnf} as
well as to all of the righteous in
Israel.[34](#appen11.html#NFIN597){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN597-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap10.html#page_324}Of course, as observed above in the analysis of
11:1--2, the church is a temple because of its identification with
Christ, who is the true temple. The Spirit himself is evidence of
Christ's victory through the resurrection. The Aramaic Old Testament of
Zechariah 4:7 (*Tg. Zechariah*) similarly identifies the cornerstone of
the temple as the Messiah, who will ensure the completion of the temple
by defeating the evil kingdoms who oppose God's people. In particular,
the Aramaic interprets the 'top stone' of the temple of Zechariah 4:7 as
God's royal 'Anointed', who 'shall rule over all kingdoms'. Zechariah
6:12--13 calls a messianic-like figure 'Branch', and repeats twice that
'He will build the temple . . . and rule . . . \[and\] be a priest on
His throne' (the Aramaic Targum substitutes 'Anointed' for
'Branch').[35](#appen11.html#NFIN598){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN598-1 .apnf}

This means that already in Zechariah the kingly and priestly roles of
chapter 4 were to be performed by two people, but in chapter 6 the dual
roles were to be combined into one messianic figure. In view of
Zechariah 6, Jewish interpretative tradition on Zechariah 4:7, and the
New Testament, especially Revelation, the building programme of
chapter 4 may be better understood: it refers respectively to Joshua's
and Zerubbabel's priestly and kingly functions of beginning the building
of the second temple, which never reached its goal because of Israel's
disobedience (cf. Zech. 6:15). Their incomplete building activities were
continued but superseded by the Messiah's coming as the priest-king to
establish the beginning of the eschatological temple only foreshadowed
by the second
temple.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN599){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN599-1 .apnf}

The broader context of Zechariah 4 shows the richness of the connection
to the present context: (1) in Zechariah 1:16--17 and 2:1--5 an angel
'measures' Jerusalem to signify that it will surely be re-established in
order that God's 'house will be built in it', and that God would be
present there (cf. Rev. 11:1--2). Indeed, as we have seen, Zechariah1--2
pictures future Jerusalem being measured in order to become the entire
temple itself, with God's glory radiating throughout it: God would 'be a
wall of fire around her and . . . the glory in her midst'
(Zech. 2:5).[37](#appen11.html#NFIN600){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN600-1 .apnf}
(2) However, Satan, together with the world
[]{#chap10.html#page_325}powers, opposed the re-establishment of God's
temple in Jerusalem (Zech. 3:1--2; 4:7), as the beast and the world
oppose the witnesses (Rev. 11:5--10).

In this respect, the image of the church as a lampstand in
Revelation 2:5 has important bearing. It is appropriate that if the
Ephesian Christians overcome by being God's faithful lampstand of
witness (2:5) and identify now with his presence, then God will cause
them to be identified consummately with 'the tree of life' (2:7). Both
the 'the tree of life' and the lampstand are partly symbolic of God's
presence. In particular, as we have seen in the analysis of
Revelation 11:4, the light which emanated from the lampstand represented
God's presence that Israel was to mediate to the
world.[38](#appen11.html#NFIN601){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN601-1 .apnf} This
notion of the lampstand connoting divine presence with the church is
confirmed more clearly from 11:4, where the 'lampstands . . . stand
*before* the Lord of the earth'. Recognizing that the lampstand in the
temple represented the tree of life in Eden (as we have argued) enhances
the identification of the two images. The two metaphors are virtually
identical or, at least, two versions of the same picture and reality.

As observed earlier, the lampstand's 'stylized tree shape and vocabulary
of botanical terms that describe it suggest that the cultic lampstand
symbolized the fructifying powers of the eternal, unseen
God'.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN602){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN602-1 .apnf} As we
have already likewise seen, even the decorative palm trees, carvings of
flowers, and cherubim portrayed as part of the Solomonic temple and of
the end-time temple of Ezekiel were probably allusions to the garden
setting of Eden.[40](#appen11.html#NFIN603){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN603-1
.apnf} The Dead Sea Scrolls (1QH 6.14--19) compare the Qumran saints to
Eden's tree with a 'well-spring of light' and 'brilliant flames', which
is directly linked to the 'testimony' (!) of the Teacher of
Righteousness. In this respect, could the seven lamps on the lampstand
be related to the hymnist's affirmation in the *Hymn Scroll* (1QH 7.
24), 'I will shine with a *seven-fold li*\[*ght*\] in the
*E*\[*den*[41](#appen11.html#NFIN604){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN604-1 .apnf}
which\] Thou hast \[m\]ade for Thy glory'? The
[]{#chap10.html#page_326}Qumran *Hymn Scroll* (1QS 8.5--6) also speaks
of the Essene community as 'the House of holiness' and 'an everlasting
planting', who are to be '*witnesses* of truth'!

Similarly, not accidental is Irenaeus's understanding that
Isaiah 11:1--2 pictures 'the Spirit of God' resting 'in seven forms on
the Son of God' and that Moses had 'revealed the pattern of this in the
seven-branched
candlestick'[42](#appen11.html#NFIN605){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN605-1 .apnf}
(likewise, Clement of Alexandria, *Stromata*, 5.6). This identification
reflects the scriptural truth that the Spirit was first given to God's
Son as a representative of his people, to whom he subsequently gave the
Spirit (e.g., see
Acts 2:33).[43](#appen11.html#NFIN606){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN606-1 .apnf}
Intriguingly, in this connection the Old Testament 'tree of life' could
be associated with notions of witnessing (Prov. 11:30: 'the fruit of the
righteous is a tree of life, and he who is wise wins souls'). The
observation that the five churches who are accused of sin in
Revelation 2 -- 3 all have problems with being faithful witnesses (see
Beale 1999a: *in loc.*) further enhances the association of the temple
with witness and the spread of God's presence outward to the world!

This link between Revelation 2 and 11 provides an additional connection
with the final vision of the temple where it is also pictured as a
garden whose prominent feature is a giant 'tree of life' (22:2) and the
Lord whose 'face' will be in the midst of his people (22:4) and who will
be their eternal 'lamp' (21:23; 22:5). In the light of the discussion so
far, it is perhaps not coincidence that the same Qumran text noted above
(1QH 6.14--17) compares the Essene community to the tree of Eden which
God has planted in the past and which will provide shade for the whole
earth in the
future\![44](#appen11.html#NFIN607){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN607-1 .apnf} We
see here an early Jewish interpretation of the tree of life in Eden,
which understands it to have eschatogically universal significance
similar to that in the last vision of Revelation.

These preceding paragraphs on the lampstand and Eden confirm further
that humanity's original purpose in the first garden sanctuary was to
expand outward and spread the light of God's presence throughout the
earth. After the fall, the commission to spread this presence entailed
'witnessing', since now unbelievers exist who need to be enlightened by
God's glorious presence through his evangelical priest-king image
bearers (e.g., cf. Exod. 19:6). Therefore, the church's
[]{#chap10.html#page_327}role as an arboreal lampstand of witness begins
at the commencement of the church age and is consummated when Christ
returns.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN608){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN608-1 .apnf}

### Concluding reflections on the eschatological lampstand in Revelation 11:1--4 {.int_niv2}

The church symbolized as a 'lampstand' in Revelation 11 represents God's
temple-presence that is given power by 'the seven lamps' (= the Spirit,
as in Rev. 1:4; 4:5) on it. This is a power primarily to witness as a
light uncompromisingly to the world so that the gates of hell (cf.
2:9--11, 13) would not prevail against the building of God's temple, the
true Israel, which is identified with the heavenly temple and the divine
presence (see Beale 1999a: *in loc.* on 1:16). This reiterates the
mission of true Israel as expressed by the use of Exodus 19:6 in
Revelation 1:6, both of which have their ultimate roots in the first
'Great Commission' in Genesis 1:26--28. The end-time temple has been
inaugurated in the
church.[46](#appen11.html#NFIN609){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN609-1 .apnf}
Revelation 11:1--13 confirms that the lampstands represent the church as
the true temple and the totality of the people of God witnessing between
the period of Christ's resurrection and his final coming. The Aramaic
version of Zechariah 4:7 (*Tg. Zechariah*) foresees that the successful
building of the temple in the midst of the world's opposition will be
achieved ultimately by 'the Anointed One' who 'shall rule over all
kingdoms'. In the light of Revelation 1:5--6, Christ's death and
resurrection have laid the foundation for the new temple, which he will
build through the Spirit (the lamps on the lampstand).

The shift from one lampstand in Zechariah to seven in Revelation
stresses not only that the book is intended for the church universal of
the escalated end times, but also the idea that true Israel is no longer
limited to a nation but encompasses all peoples. The escalation of
lampstands already had a precedent in Solomon's temple which had ten
lampstands (1 Kgs. 7:49) in comparison to the tabernacle's one, and
which probably was a foreshadowing of the escalation to occur
[]{#chap10.html#page_328}in the end times. The observation that the
effect of the two witnesses extends to 'some from the peoples and tribes
and tongues and nations' (11:9) and to 'the ones dwelling on the earth'
(11:10) also indicates the progressive and inaugurated advancement of
God's end-time temple that was beginning to be extended throughout the
earth.

## Other texts in the Apocalypse that further contribute to understanding the end-time temple in Revelation 11 and 21 -- 22 {.int_niv1}

The mention in Revelation 3:12a of believers becoming identified
eternally with the 'temple' (*naos*) by being made a permanent 'pillar'
(*stylos*) in it emphasizes the above-mentioned theme of divine presence
even more. This is evident from 21:22 -- 22:5, which explains that there
is no physical 'temple' (*naos*) in the heavenly Jerusalem but that 'the
Lord God almighty is its temple \[*naos*\] and the Lamb' (21:22; so also
7:15--17), and those in the city walk by their light (21:23--25; 22:5)
and dwell in their immediate presence (22:3--4).

Christ's statement that he would write upon the overcomer who becomes
permanently identified with the temple 'the name of My God, and the name
of the city of My God' (Rev. 3:12) recalls Ezekiel 48:35 (cf. 1
Maccabees 14:26ff.). There the 'name of the city' of the new Jerusalem
is 'the Lord is there' because he has established his latter-day temple
in its midst, where his glory will reside for
ever.[47](#appen11.html#NFIN610){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN610-1 .apnf}
Likewise, the verbatim language of Revelation 3:12 is repeated again in
Revelation 21:2 to introduce a vision of the end-time temple of God,
where God will dwell for ever with his people, and which is modelled on
the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 temple (see on 21:10 -- 22:5). This further
emphasizes the theme of divine presence in 3:12. Identification with
Jesus' 'name' (3:12b) is tantamount to being identified with Jesus as
the temple (21:22), so that the believer becomes permanently associated
with the tabernacling presence of God in Jesus.

This line of thought in which Jesus' followers persevere through
tribulation and then are rewarded with the presence of God and Christ in
the 'temple' (*naos*) is also developed in 7:14--17, which indicates
inaugurated, or possibly consummated, fulfilment of the prophecy in
[]{#chap10.html#page_329}Ezekiel 37:25--27 that God's 'dwelling place'
and 'sanctuary' would be with his people. The temple promise of the
Ezekiel 37 passage is a part of the promise of the future temple in
Ezekiel 40 -- 48. That both passages are part of the same promise is
apparent from noticing that twice in 37:25--28 and twice in 43:7, 9
occurs the phrase 'I will dwell among the sons of Israel
forever'.[48](#appen11.html#NFIN611){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN611-1 .apnf}

The believer's permanent identification with the 'sanctuary' in
Revelation 3:12 includes in its purview the consummation of the process
which began with Christ unlocking the doors of the invisible sanctuary
of salvation to them, as expressed in Revelation 3:7b--8a: ' . . . I
have put before you an open door which no one can
shut'.[49](#appen11.html#NFIN612){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN612-1 .apnf} This
true sanctuary is placed in clear contrast with the false synagogue of
the Jews who now give ultimate allegiance to Satan (so 3:9). A link with
3:7--8 is borne out further by noticing that the closest parallels to
3:8 and 3:12 are found in chapter 21 (respectively 21:25 and 21:2, 10):
Christ begins to 'open' the doors of the heavenly Jerusalem and temple
for the faithful here on earth, which no-one can shut, and this is
consummated when his people enter through 'the gates' of the new
Jerusalem and temple, which 'by no means will they shut'. That the
promise of a place in the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 end-time temple has been
inaugurated is suggested by the above parallel with Revelation 11:2, and
the fact that 11:2 pictures the community of faith on earth as already
identified with the latter-day temple of Ezekiel (see on 11:1--2).

The permanent establishment of the overcomer as a pillar in the temple
may also continue the imagery of Isaiah 22:22ff. from Revelation 3:7,
where Eliakim's relatives achieve glory by 'hanging on him as a *peg*
firmly attached to a wall'. Some Greek Old Testament witnesses even
refer to Eliakim as being set up as a 'pillar' in
Isaiah 22:23.[50](#appen11.html#NFIN613){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN613-1
.apnf} The Aramaic translation of Isaiah 22:23--25 also views Eliakim as
a priest in the temple and that other priests depend on him for their
service in the
temple.[51](#appen11.html#NFIN614){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN614-1 .apnf}
Eliakim eventually loses his place as a firm peg, but the latter-day
Eliakim, Jesus, is immovable as a 'peg' []{#chap10.html#page_330}or
'pillar' of the temple, with which his followers become permanently
identified, even during the church age.

Intriguing again is the observation that, assuming the validity of the
association of Isaiah 22:22 with the temple in Revelation 3:7, the
portrayal of the temple is explained by witnessing to the world of
unbelief (cf. Rev. 3:8--9), as is the case in Revelation 11 and 1 Peter
2-- 3! That the letter to Philadelphia begins and ends with a reference
to the temple is supported by the other letters where Christ introduces
himself from part of chapter 1's description of him that is uniquely
appropriate to each particular church's situation and which has some
essential identification with the kind of reward given to that church.
For example, we noted above that the 'lampstand' in Revelation 2:1, 5 is
an inaugurated reality of the 'tree of life' with which true saints
begin to be identified in the present and are consummately identified on
the Last Day (2:7). Or, the present ruling 'Son of God', an allusion to
Psalm 2:7, is introduced in 2:18 in the letter to Thyatira; then at the
end of the epistle (2:26--28), he says he has begun to fulfil the
Psalm 2 prophecy of the Son of God's rule over the earth. Or, again,
Christ's eternal resurrection life (2:8) will be imparted to the
overcomers (2:10--11).

These texts from Revelation 7 and especially Revelation 3 alluding to
Ezekiel's eschatological temple have a biblical-theologically organic
connection to the conceptions of the same Ezekiel temple in
Revelation 11 and 21 -- 22! Both also underscore the spiritual nature of
the new temple notion, as well as its already and not yet end-time
nature. That Revelation 3:12 in particular pictures believers having
begun to become part of the latter-day temple is further apparent from
noticing that some of the other promises to the 'overcomers' in the
other letters have also likely begun fulfilment during the church age.
For example, the reward of 'white garments', becoming identified with
Christ's 'name' and sitting on a throne with Christ begins to be given
even during the course of the Christian
age.[52](#appen11.html#NFIN615){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN615-1 .apnf}

The word 'sanctuary' or 'temple' (*naos*) occurs ten more times between
Revelation 11:2 and 21:22. All refer to the heavenly temple. All these
uses likely refer to various facets of the same inaugurated end-time
temple as spoken of in the passages examined in Revelation so
far.[53](#appen11.html#NFIN616){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN616-1 .apnf} The
focus in these remaining texts is on the heavenly location
[]{#chap10.html#page_331}of the temple. It extends in part to encompass
saints on the earth during the church age. In addition to
Revelation 11:1--4, Revelation 13:6 probably also portrays the extension
of the heavenly sanctuary to surround Christians living on earth: the
forces of evil 'blaspheme' God's 'tabernacle, that is, those who
\[spiritually\] tabernacle in heaven' but who physically live on earth
(especially in light of Rev. 13:7: 'it was given to him \[the beast\] to
make war with the saints \[on earth\]') (on 13:6 see Beale 1999a: *in
loc.*). This heavenly temple comes down completely to envelop the entire
cosmos at the end of the age. Revelation 21 portrays this consummated
reality of the temple.

## The church as the eschatological temple in 1 Peter 2 and its relationship to Revelation's temple {.int_niv1}

First Peter 2:4--9 confirms the analysis of Revelation 11 that in
sectors of early Christianity the church was conceived of both as a
'royal priesthood' (in allusion to Exod. 19:6, as in Rev. 1:6; 5:10) and
as a temple in the process of being built and expanded from Christ, the
foundation stone of the new temple. The purpose of the church as a
temple and priests is that they 'may proclaim the excellencies of Him
who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light' (1 Pet.
2:9). We observed earlier that Psalm 92:12--15 had close parallels both
with 1 Corinthians 3, as well as 1 Peter 2. The psalm pictures the
'righteous' as trees planted and growing in 'the house of God' on a
'rock' foundation. The goal of believers being identified with the
temple was 'that they might declare that the Lord . . . God is
righteous'. First Peter's statement of the virtually identical goal may
be echoing the psalm passage. Regardless, the psalmist's conception of
the 'evangelical' goal of the living temple finally finds much greater
redemptive-historical fulfilment in Christ and his people. They are the
true latter-day temple, who finally are able to fulfil the commission of
extending God's glory from the sanctuary.

The cultic goal of 'proclaiming the excellencies' of God in 1 Peter 2:9
is developed further in 1 Peter 3:14--15 where Peter cites
Isaiah 8:12--13 in affirming that Christians are not to fear unbelieving
opposition but are 'to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give
an account for the hope that is in you . . .' Indeed, Isaiah 8:14 was
part of the earlier description of the church as a temple in 1 Peter 2,
and this Isaiah background is appropriate to express this notion:
Isaiah 8:13--14 says, '\[God\] shall be your fear . . . Then He shall
become a sanctuary' (the Greek OT paraphrases, 'If you shall trust in
him, he will be for you a sanctuary'). []{#chap10.html#page_332}This is
all comparable to Revelation 11, since both contexts refer to God's
people as a spiritually inviolable temple who spread God's presence and
word but whose physical being can be harmed.

What we have in Revelation 11 and 1 Peter 2 then is the conception of
God's saints being the true temple of God's presence in initial
fulfilment of the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 temple prophecy (though 1 Peter
quotes other OT temple texts) and extending that presence throughout the
earth by means of their witness. The new temple begins with Christ as
the foundation 'stone' and continues to be 'built up as a spiritual
house' (1 Pet. 2:4--6) until it is completed on the last day of
history.[54](#appen11.html#NFIN617){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN617-1 .apnf}
Ephesians 2:20--22 also highlights the same
point:[55](#appen11.html#NFIN618){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN618-1 .apnf}
Christ is 'the corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted
together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are
being built together into a dwelling of God in the
Spirit'\![56](#appen11.html#NFIN619){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN619-1 .apnf}
During the present age, the very being of the church as witnesses of an
invisible temple conveys the presence of God to others, either in
blessing or judgment (the latter being the focus of Revelation 11).

Our earlier discussion of a passage in the early Christian *Epistle of
Barnabas*[57](#appen11.html#NFIN620){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN620-1 .apnf}
merits review at this point. The text applies the commission of Adam
(Gen. 1:28), and the same commission renewed to Israel in the land, to
Christ and the church as a new creation. Jesus and his people are the
beginning true fulfilment of the commission (*Barnabas* 6:11--17), which
will be completed in the future (6:18--19). Christ is called a 'stone
that crushes \[Dan. 2:34--35, 45\] . . . a precious stone, especially
chosen, a cornerstone \[Is. 28:16\]' (*Barnabas*
6:3).[58](#appen11.html#NFIN621){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN621-1 .apnf} Christ
is referred to as the centre of the new temple in 6:14--15, which seems
to develop the allusion to him as a 'cornerstone' at the beginning of
the same chapter (6:3--4). The end-time sanctuary grows out from Christ
(the initial foundation stone) during the church age:
[]{#chap10.html#page_333}'there is in fact a temple of God . . .
\[that\] he is building and completing', and at the 'end God's temple
will be built gloriously' (16:6). The remainder of *Barnabas* 16
(16:7--10) explains that the way the temple 'is being built for the
Lord' is by God 'dwelling in our dwelling place' by means of people
believing in Christ for forgiveness of sin, setting their hope on him,
and trusting in his righteous precepts.

## Excursus on Christ as the foundation stone of the temple, and, hence, of the new creation in the light of the Ancient Near East, the Old Testament and Judaism {.int_niv1}

Ancient Near Eastern mythologies sometimes portray a hillock arising
amidst the chaotic seas as the bridgehead of creation, as we have seen,
for example, in the Egyptian
cosmogonies.[59](#appen11.html#NFIN622){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN622-1 .apnf}
The same thing may be reflected in the second biblical creation episode,
where the first item that emerges from the waters is the tip of a
mountain on which Noah's Ark comes to rest (see Levenson 1988: 74--75).
Intriguingly, the stone supporting the holy of holies was thought by
later Judaism to be that upon which 'all the world was based', since, it
was believed, God had begun to create the world from that point in the
beginning.[60](#appen11.html#NFIN623){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN623-1 .apnf}
The 'world was started \[created\] from Zion . . . the world was created
from its centre' when God 'cast a stone into the ocean, from which the
world then was founded' (*b. Yoma* 54b). The light God made in Genesis 1
'was created from the place of the Temple' (*Midrash Rabbah Genesis*
3:4).[61](#appen11.html#NFIN624){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN624-1 .apnf}

It is this background that likely gave rise to the notion that Israel
was the 'middle (or navel) of the
earth'.[62](#appen11.html#NFIN625){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN625-1 .apnf} The
reason that Israel and her temple were likely also considered to be the
centre of the earth is because it was the place where divine wisdom
resided.[63](#appen11.html#NFIN626){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN626-1 .apnf} The
wisdom []{#chap10.html#page_334}needed to maintain ethical order
emanated from the temple, and when humanity violated the ethical cosmic
order, the physical world order began to break up. Hence, Israel's
temple was the theological centre of the earth. It is likely against
this background that the following saying arose: 'Upon three things the
universe stands: upon Torah, and upon the Temple service, and upon deeds
of loving-kindness' (*m. Aboth*
1.2).[64](#appen11.html#NFIN627){#chap10.html#ap_NFIN627-1 .apnf}

The New Testament contends that Christ is the stone upon which the new
world is based and from which it proceeds; likewise, Christ is the
source from which true cosmic wisdom proceeds (so, e.g., Col. 2:2--3).

# The temple in Ezekiel 40 -- 48 and its relationship to the New Testament {.chap_tit}

::: dev
Though the preceding chapter discussed the use of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 in
Revelation 3, 7 and 19, more clarification of this vision in its Old
Testament context is needed. Indeed, it would be remiss in a book on a
biblical theology of the temple not to include a chapter on the
wellknown temple vision of Ezekiel 40 -- 48. Though the constraints of
the present book do not allow a thorough investigation of Ezekiel's
temple vision, it is still important to give a broad sketch of what we
think is the best approach. The main lines of interpretation are, at
least, fourfold. First, the vision is prophetic of a literal physical
temple to be built in
Israel.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN628){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN628-1 .apnf}
Second, the vision is figurative of an ideal heavenly temple that was
never intended to be built or established on the earth (Tuell 1996:
649--664). Third, the portrayal is a figurative vision of an ideal
temple. Fourth, the depiction is of a real heavenly temple that would
descend and be established on earth in non-structural form in the latter
days.

The primary argument for the first view is that a 'literal
historical-grammatical hermeneutic' dictates that the vision be
understood as referring to a future physical structure, quite comparable
to the Solomonic temple. According to this interpretative principle, one
interprets 'literally' (which usually means interpreting in a way
corresponding to physical reality) unless the context demands a
figurative analysis. This is supported further by appeal to the
extensive descriptions of the temple in chapters 40 -- 46. As we shall
see, however, there are indications from the context of the vision that
point to the second, third or fourth interpretations as more likely. A
combination of the last two might even be possible: Ezekiel 40 -- 48
foresees an ideal heavenly temple that already has existence and that
will descend to earth at the end of
history.[2](#appen11.html#NFIN629){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN629-1 .apnf} The
purpose of this analysis is also to []{#chap11.html#page_336}show how
Ezekiel's vision fits into the biblical-theological patterns of temple
establishment and expansion discussed thus far.

::: {#chap11.html#niv1-046 .niv1}
## The contextual connections of chapters 40 -- 48 within the book of Ezekiel that point to a non-structural end-time temple {.int_niv1}

The first hints that the vision is not about a conventional
architectural structure occur at its inception (40:1--2), where God sets
the prophet on 'a very high mountain' in Israel, and where on the south
part of the mountain he sees 'a structure like a city'. All commentators
agree that the location is Jerusalem, but there is no 'very high
mountain' in
Jerusalem.[3](#appen11.html#NFIN630){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN630-1 .apnf}
This lack of a referent indicates that we are entering into the realm of
symbolic geography of heaven or earth that pertains to eschatological
conditions.[4](#appen11.html#NFIN631){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN631-1 .apnf}
That this is so finds confirmation in Revelation 21:10, where John
similarly finds himself 'carried . . . away in the Spirit to a great and
high mountain', and an angel showed him 'the holy city, Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God'. That Ezekiel then sees 'a structure
like a city' on the mountain shows that the mountain is not only high
but of extraordinary enough size to contain the entire city of
Jerusalem. It is true that even the old temple on Mount Zion could be
referred to as situated on a very high place but when such descriptions
occurred they were figurative to emphasize the link of the old temple
with the heavenly temple (e.g., see 1 Kgs.
8:13,[5](#appen11.html#NFIN632){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN632-1 .apnf} as well
as Exod. 15:17 and possibly Jer. 17:12). At such points the focus was on
the heavenly sanctuary 'high' in heaven, which the earthly holy of
holies symbolized. While there are similarities, the depiction of the
mountain in Ezekiel 40 is different from figurative language applied to
Israel's earthly temple, since even 'the city' is seen to be situated on
the 'very high []{#chap11.html#page_337}mountain', thus pointing to a
focus on a temple set only in a symbolic geographical world of another
dimension.

The geographical symbolism is enhanced from noticing that the threefold
introductory vision phraseology of Ezekiel 40:1--4 occurs in the book
only at chapter 1 (1:1--3) and chapter 8
(8:1--3):[6](#appen11.html#NFIN633){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN633-1 .apnf} (1)
an initial comment about the specific date on which the experience
occurred; (2) 'the hand of Yahweh came upon him'; (3) and Ezekiel 'saw .
. . visions'. Two additional common elements are that the visions occur
by 'the river Chebar' (1:1, 3; 10:15, 22; 43:3) and that 'the glory of
God' is an essential component of all three vision episodes (1:28; 8:4;
9:3; 10:4, 18--19; 11:22--23; 43:2, 5). What is unique about the uses in
Ezekiel 1 and 8 is that each introduces a vision in which the prophet
receives a glimpse of part of a heavenly temple. This is quite clear in
chapter 1, where Ezekiel says 'the heavens were opened', and he saw the
four cherubim guarding God's heavenly throne. The theophany was coming
from the 'north' (*[ṣ]{.mev1}āpôn*) which reflects the great cosmic
heavenly mountain where God's true throne was thought to reside. The
heavenly dimension of the temple comes to Ezekiel in Babylon, so that
the earthly Jerusalem temple is not the subject. Furthermore, this
theophany of Yahweh in his heavenly temple was intended to reassure the
prophet that the faithful among the exiles were still related to the
true heavenly temple, though the old one had been
decimated.[7](#appen11.html#NFIN634){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN634-1 .apnf}
Thus, chapter 1 focuses only on the temple's heavenly dimension.

Chapters 8 -- 9 are a vision of the heavenly dimension of the sanctuary
dwelling in the midst of the physical temple, while chapter 10 describes
that heavenly
dwelling[8](#appen11.html#NFIN635){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN635-1 .apnf} as
beginning to depart from the earthly complex, and 11:22--23 pictures the
final departure of God's glory from the dwelling. The climax of these
chapters is in 11:22--23, where the presence of God's heavenly
sanctuary, formerly having extended down to the earthly holy of holies,
finally departs back to heaven. Then this presence returns to earth, not
to inhabit a structural temple but to be an invisible 'sanctuary for
them \[remnant Israel\] a little while' in exile (11:16). This was a
heavenly sanctuary that had its corresponding earthly sanctuary in the
faithful remnant of exiles in Babylon. As remarked above, the chapter 1
vision probably represents the same reality, since it occurs in Babylon
to []{#chap11.html#page_338}Ezekiel, a prophetic representative of the
faithful (as Ezek. 11:25 suggests).

The unique introductory formulae that chapters 1 and 8 share in common
with chapter 40 bind them all together. Since chapters 40 -- 48 also
pertain to a temple, the question is whether it refers to the purely
heavenly temple dimension that descends in the midst of the faithful
saints on earth (as in chapters 1 and 11), or the heavenly dimension in
the midst of another (new) earthly temple in structural form, as in
chapters 8 -- 9. Whichever is the case, the focus is on the heavenly
temple. The pressing question then is: what is the earthly reality to
which the heavenly temple of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 corresponds? The answer to
this all-important question is that the vision likely pertains to the
heavenly temple corresponding to God's dwelling in the midst of his
people, and not in a physical temple. The reason for favouring this
comes from the following cumulative evidence presented in the remainder
of this chapter, both from within the book of Ezekiel, as well as from
elsewhere in the Old Testament.

As we have said, the initial mention of Ezekiel being on a mountain
(40:2) focuses the vision on heavenly geography, not earthly. We have
seen earlier that Israel's earthly temple was a reflection or copy of
the heavenly temple.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN636){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN636-1
.apnf} Most clearly, we have observed in a preceding chapter that the
holy of holies represented the invisible dimension of God's heavenly
dwelling.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN637){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN637-1 .apnf}
Since the heavenly temple did not descend through Israel's earthly
temple to fill the earth (so Ezek. 8 -- 11), Ezekiel 40 -- 48 pictures
the ongoing existence of the heavenly temple in the future when it will
descend, but, we would argue, not through a handmade structure. Such an
interpretation receives early attestation in the Qumran *Songs of
Sabbath Sacrifice* (4Q400--407), where images and terms from Ezekiel 40
-- 48 are applied to a heavenly eschatological temple that the Dead Sea
community believed to have been inaugurated, and to which they were
spiritually
related.[11](#appen11.html#NFIN638){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN638-1 .apnf}

The thematic link with the heavenly temple descending among the faithful
and not into an earthly structure (11:16) is enhanced by noticing that
the vision there ends with God's tabernacling presence remaining 'over
the mountain which is east of the city' (11:23). Likewise, 40:2 begins
with God carrying Ezekiel to 'a very high mountain; and on it to the
south was a structure like a city'. These []{#chap11.html#page_339}are
probably the same symbolic mountains, but if not, they are very similar.
If the former, then chapter 40 begins where chapter 11 left off:
describing God's heavenly presence that had departed from the physical
temple and had taken up invisible residence with the remnant of Israel
in exile (11:16,
23--25).[12](#appen11.html#NFIN639){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN639-1 .apnf} It
is, therefore, quite viable that Ezekiel's final vision of the temple
describes the heavenly sanctuary to which the remnant on earth are
related (Tuell 1996). The formal and thematic parallels between
chapters 1, 8 -- 11, and 40 -- 48 'require that the same hermeneutical
principles \[of symbolism\] employed in the interpretation of the
previous prophecies apply here, and that one interpret this block \[chs.
40 -- 48\] in the light of the previous visions of God' (Block 1998:
496--497).

More plausibly, therefore, the vision describes the heavenly temple that
will relate to the eschatological people of God. This is borne out also
from a key phrase in 11:20, in which God says that Israel 'will be My
people, and I shall be their God' at the time of the end-time
restoration, when he gives them a 'new spirit' and 'heart' (11:19
= 36:26). This phrase is interpreted in Ezekiel 37:26--28 to be a
promise that God would establish his eschatological 'sanctuary' in
Israel.[13](#appen11.html#NFIN640){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN640-1 .apnf}

In an earlier chapter (ch. 3), we concluded for two reasons that this
sanctuary in Ezekiel 37 was not a building but God's tabernacling
presence. First, this passage is a clear allusion to
Leviticus 26:11--12: 'moreover, I will make My *tabernacle among you . .
.* I will also *walk among you* and be your God, and you will be my
people'. A 'literal' reading of Leviticus could well suggest that the
promise of God's eschatological 'walking among' the people will express
itself more intensely and personally than would his dwelling with them
in an encased structure during the wilderness
wandering.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN641){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN641-1 .apnf}

Second, Ezekiel 37:27 says, 'My dwelling place also will be *over*
\[preposition ̒*al* \] them'. If this is also taken straightforwardly,
it refers to God's spiritual presence being over *all Israelites*, which
means that it would extend over not only the city but the entire
promised land. Hence, as with the 'sanctuary' in 11:16, a small cultic
building does not appear to be in mind. Twice in this passage God says
that 'My []{#chap11.html#page_340}sanctuary is in their midst forever'
(vv. 26, 28; note 'dwelling place' in v. 27). Ezekiel 43:7, 9 also says
virtually the same thing twice in the course of describing the extended
vision of the temple: 'I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel
forever.' It is possible that these synonymous expressions refer to
different sanctuaries, but when it is recalled that they pertain to the
same period of the end-time, it is probable that Ezekiel 43 is
developing the prophecy of the sanctuary in Ezekiel
37.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN642){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN642-1 .apnf} What
further unites the sanctuaries of Ezekiel 37 and 43 is their common
Garden of Eden imagery: cf. Ezek. 36:35 and 37:5, 26--28 with 47:1--12.
These observations bolster our conclusion that Ezekiel 40 -- 48 refers
to a heavenly temple linked to a non-architectural earthly reality, in
development of Ezekiel
37.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN643){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN643-1 .apnf}

## The descriptions within chapters 40 -- 48 that point to a non-structural end-time temple {.int_niv1}

Not only the broad context of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 but the text of the
temple vision itself provide evidence suggesting that this is not a
vision of a traditionally conceived handmade temple.

::: {#chap11.html#niv2-093 .niv2}
### Unusual features that point beyond a localized temple {.int_niv2}

That Ezekiel sees a much bigger reality than one localized temple
structure is evident from the vision's introduction (40:2), where he
summarizes the temple vision that follows by saying that he saw on the
top of the mountain 'a structure like a city'. That is, he saw a temple
structured like a city, or perhaps a city structured like a temple. The
very end of the vision (48:35) says that 'the name of the city from that
day shall be, "The Lord is there."' ' In other words, what formerly was
true of the holy of holies will one day be true of the entire city of
Jerusalem. Thus, Ezekiel 40:2 and 48:35 form the boundaries of the whole
temple vision, and plausibly provide the vision's interpretative
summary: the temple is equivalent to the city because the whole city
will be filled with God's presence that was formerly limited to the
innermost sanctuary of Israel's temple. In chapter 4, we saw a similar
prophecy in Jeremiah 3:16--17. There the ark of the
[]{#chap11.html#page_341}Lord was to be remembered no more in the
end-time restoration because God's throne will expand from the holy of
holies to cover, at minimum, the whole city of Jerusalem: 'At that time
they shall call Jerusalem "The Throne of the L[ORD]{.small}," and all
the nations will be gathered to it for the name of the L[ORD]{.small} in
Jerusalem . . .' (Ezek. 43:7 uses the language of 'the place of My
throne').

The boundaries of Ezekiel's temple are particularly striking in that
they are approximately the same size (a little over one mile) as the
boundaries of ancient Jerusalem (during the second temple
era).[17](#appen11.html#NFIN644){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN644-1 .apnf} The
massive expansion of the temple is a quite similar picture to that in
Jeremiah 3:17. This magnification of the tabernacling glory is apparent
from observing that God's glory not merely filled the temple (43:4--5),
as it had at the consecration of Solomon's temple (1 Kgs. 8:10--11), but
even 'the earth \[or land\] shone with His glory' (43:2) (Duguid
1999:489). The water that flowed from the temple also affected the
territory throughout Israel. The trickling waters from the temple
quickly became a deep river and 'healed' all life in it, as well as
feeding into and 'healing' the Dead Sea. Such magnified perspectives of
the temple and the divine glory, together with the widening effects of
the temple river may have supplied the impetus for later Judaism to
assert that those waters affected the entire
earth.[18](#appen11.html#NFIN645){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN645-1 .apnf} At
least one recent Old Testament commentator has made a similar
conclusion: 'The return of paradise \[in Ezek. 47:1--12\], apparently at
present limited to Palestine, is of its very nature a universal event
embracing the whole world . . . Palestine is a part that stands for the
whole' (Eichrodt 1970:585).

This conclusion is supported from observing that the expanding features
of the vision fit admirably into the numerous other Old Testament,
Jewish and early Christian accounts of an expanding temple or garden of
Eden (or both) that we have examined earlier,
[]{#chap11.html#page_342}especially eschatological prophecies of
non-structural temples (e.g., Is. 4:5--6; 57:15; 66:1--2; and Zech. 1 --
2; cf. also Is. 8:14). Therefore, the fact that Ezekiel 47:1--12
portrays the water flowing from the temple and causing widespread
fertility should be no
surprise.[19](#appen11.html#NFIN646){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN646-1 .apnf}
Allusions to Eden are seen in the temple-city's river and trees, and the
fact that it is located on 'a very high
mountain'.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN647){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN647-1 .apnf}
Waters that go out from Eden and cause the garden's trees to grow and
envelop the earth in Ezekiel 31 is one of the expanding garden scenes we
have observed earlier. However, the image of chapter 31 describes a
pagan nation that failed, as Adam had, in expanding their garden-like
empire. Ezekiel 17:1--10 and 19:10--14 describe Israel's rise and demise
through the very same Edenic arboreal imagery. What Adam and subsequent
ungodly kingdoms had failed to do, Ezekiel 47 represents as finally
being accomplished at some future
point,[21](#appen11.html#NFIN648){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN648-1 .apnf} a
link which confirms further the universal scope of the scene in Ezekiel
47. Similarly, the 'high mountain' of 40:2, on which the temple and city
sit, develops Ezekiel 28's reflection on 'the holy mountain of God'
(28:14; cf. 28:16), upon which was 'Eden, the garden of God' (28:13)
(cf. Levenson 1976: 25--26). Whereas Ezekiel 28 recounts the corruption
of the garden, the mountain of God with its pure garden in Ezekiel 40 --
48 provides a sharp contrast.

Additional details of Ezekiel's vision are so strange that they would
seem to require a symbolic understanding. The city is perfectly square
(Ezek. 48:16); the territorial allotments for each Israelite tribe are
'divided by dead straight lines running east and west and ignoring all
the facts of geography (48:1--29)' (Ellison 1956: 139). The dimensions
of the city and temple are described with multiples of five, with
twenty-five being particularly repeated (Block 1998: 502). Further,
horizontal measurements are the only recorded dimensions, with no
apparent regard for vertical distances that are necessary for an
architectural plan (Block 1998: 510--511). Equally unusual is the water
that flows out of the temple (47:1--2). A little over a half-mile to the
east the waters deepen into an ankle-deep brook (v. 3). Within another
half a mile, the []{#chap11.html#page_343}water deepens to the knees,
and eventually to the waist (v. 4). About another quarter of a mile
further on, the river deepens to such a degree that it can be crossed
only by swimming (v. 5). The problem with a literal understanding of the
river is that there are no tributaries mentioned that feed into the
river to make it deeper. And, if there are unmentioned tributaries, then
'common' water would be mixed with the pure water of life. If the
picture were of an actual river, then it would have to be
super-naturally produced and its purity supernaturally maintained (which
some might dare to believe describes a condition in a coming
millennium).[22](#appen11.html#NFIN649){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN649-1 .apnf}
That this river requires supernatural maintenance is underscored by
realizing that the salinity of the Dead Sea does not affect the fresh
water's purity, but rather the reverse (C. J. H. Wright 2001: 356).

Thus, the overall impression one gets from the various descriptions in
Ezekiel 40 -- 48 is that they are 'highly contrived, casting doubt on
any interpretation that expects a literal fulfilment' (Block 1998: 502).

### Features that point beyond a localized temple, especially in the light of the fuller revelation of the New Testament {.int_niv2}

The notorious problem of what to make of the sacrifices in Ezekiel's
temple may be solved by seeing them beginning fulfilment in Christians
who offer themselves to God by suffering for their faith, as we
discussed in the preceding chapter. Implicitly, Christ's great sacrifice
is the ultimate fulfilment of Ezekiel's temple vision, since
Revelation 11 portrays the career of the church according to the outline
of Christ's career.[23](#appen11.html#NFIN650){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN650-1
.apnf} Hence, it is not incorrect to say that Ezekiel speaks in the
language and images familiar to his audience in portraying sacrifices in
a temple to prophesy about the escalated redemptive-historical realities
of Christ's sacrifice and the church's imitation of that sacrifice. Both
of these 'sacrifices' of the new epoch are linked exegetically by
allusions to the Ezekiel temple in Revelation 11:1--2 and the Lamb of
21:22.

Those who see a literal temple structure as the fulfilment of Ezekiel's
prophecy usually interpret the sacrifices there to be 'memorial
sacrifices' that commemorate Christ's death. In response, numerous
commentators have pointed out that this would violate the principle of
Hebrews: the Old Testament sacrifices pointed to Christ's 'once for all'
sacrifice (Heb. 9:12, 26, 28; 10:10--18), so that to go back to those
sacrifices would indicate the insufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for
sin (cf., e.g., Heb. 10:18: 'Now where there is forgiveness of these
[]{#chap11.html#page_344}things, there is no longer any offering for
sin'). This would appear to amount to a reversal of redemptive history
and, more importantly, a denial of the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice.

The Scofield Bible, espousing the standard literalist dispensational
approach, gives a surprising response to what appears to be a vexing
problem for those arguing for the future revival of the sacrificial
system. In addition to saying that the sacrifices might be memorials,
Scofield also offers the following possibility: 'The reference to
sacrifices \[in Ezekiel's temple prophecy\] is not to be taken
literally, in view of the putting away of such offerings \[according to
Hebrews\], but is rather to be regarded as a presentation of the worship
of redeemed Israel, in her own land and in the millennial temple, using
the terms with which the Jews were familiar in Ezekiel's day' (Scofield
1967: 888).

More than one commentator has recognized the inconsistency in this
quotation from the Scofield Bible: 'These words convey a farreaching
concession on the part of dispensationalists. If the sacrifices are not
to be taken literally, why should we take the temple literally? It would
seem that the dispensational principle of the literal interpretation of
Old Testament prophecy is here abandoned, and that a crucial foundation
stone for the entire dispensationalist system has been set aside!'
(Hoekema 1979: 204). Therefore, 'make the sacrifices symbolic and the
temple becomes symbolic too' (Ellison 1956: 140). Even to entertain the
possibility that the sacrifices are memorials contravenes a literal
interpretation of prophecy because of the Hebrew word that Ezekiel uses
to explain the purpose of the sacrifices: 'to make atonement' (45:15,
17, 20). The verb is *kipper* (in the Piel verb form), which is the
exact word (and verb form) employed in the Pentateuch to describe
sacrifices that have an atoning purpose (Lev. 6:30 \[23\]; 8:15; 16:6,
11, 24, 30, 32, 33, 34; Num. 5:8; 15:28; 29:5) (following Hoekema 1979:
204). Of course, the atoning purpose in the Old Testament accomplished
only a temporary 'covering' (which is the meaning of *kipper*) of
Israel's sin, which pointed typologically to Christ's 'once for all
atonement'. The point is that Ezekiel does not call these sacrifices
'memorials', but puts them on a par with the Levitical typological
sacrifices of atonement. From a New Testament perspective, the Lord's
Supper is the only memorial instituted by Christ to 'memorialize' his
redemptive work. To suggest that this memorial will cease in a coming
millennium, to be replaced by the 'old' Old Testament
sacrifices,[24](#appen11.html#NFIN651){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN651-1 .apnf}
not []{#chap11.html#page_345}only is at variance with the book of
Hebrews, but abrogates Christ's command to remember him in the Lord's
Supper (Ellison 1956:
142).[25](#appen11.html#NFIN652){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN652-1 .apnf} Thus,
in light of the evidence, it does not seem likely that Ezekiel's
sacrifices will be literally fulfilled in a future
temple.[26](#appen11.html#NFIN653){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN653-1 .apnf}

A related issue is whether or not to take literally Ezekiel's apparent
portrait of Jerusalem as the centre of the world to which Gentiles must
come in order to be related to God (Ezek. 47). If taken in a narrowly
literal manner, then the redemptive-historical principle of John 4:21,
23 would be radically violated: 'an hour is coming when neither in this
mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall you worship the Father . . . but an
hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the
Father in \[the Holy\] Spirit and
truth'.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN654){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN654-1 .apnf} This
principle is related in Jesus' mind to Ezekiel's vision. Jesus alludes
to the water flowing from Ezekiel's end-time temple in John 7:38 and
interprets it of himself and of the Spirit in relation to believers, a
passage that further develops the 'living water' theme of John
4.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN655){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN655-1 .apnf} One could
say, therefore, that just as the picture in Ezekiel 47 of Jerusalem as
the centre for world worship is meant to be taken figuratively on the
basis of Jesus' teaching, so also is all of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 to be
taken.

One does not need, however, to resort to a figurative approach to be
consistent with Jesus' teaching, if one of our main lines of argument so
far in the book is correct: that in the end time an Eden-temple will be
established as a new Jerusalem that will extend throughout the whole
earth. That the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 vision is a part of this universally
expanding pattern observed elsewhere in the Old Testament is likely,
given the hints of widening in the vision that we have observed earlier
in this chapter (e.g., see Ezek. 48:35 in light of Jer. 3:17, and note
the implicit universal effect of the temple's waters upon the fertility
of the entire earth).

## []{#chap11.html#page_346}Is the temple-city in Revelation 21 the fulfilment of Ezekiel's vision? {.int_niv1}

Some commentators do not see an eschatological focus in Ezekiel 40 --
48, which would mean that no prophetic fulfilment of the vision is to be
expected. For example, Daniel Block argues that Ezekiel's vision is
primarily 'a lofty spiritual ideal' and de-emphasizes any specific
end-time fulfilment of it (1998:
506).[29](#appen11.html#NFIN656){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN656-1 .apnf} His
argument for an idealized temple is acceptable, but why is this
incompatible with an end-time fulfilment? He contends that the Ezekiel
narrative is *not eschatological* for three primary reasons: (1) there
are no explicit latterday expressions; (2) the word 'eternal' (or
'forever') in 43:7, 9 should not be viewed eschatologically; and (3) the
blueprint of the temple is not presented as something to be built with
human hands (e.g., there is no command that it be built, as there is
with the tabernacle) (1998: 504--505). Regarding the first point,
expression of eschatological 'concepts' does not always depend on the
use of technical eschatological 'terms'. Second, that 'eternal' in 43:7,
9 is, indeed, eschatological is apparent from seeing these verses as a
development of 'eternal' in 37:26, 28, where it clearly describes the
end of history, as Block himself acknowledges (1998:
419--423).[30](#appen11.html#NFIN657){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN657-1 .apnf}
Third, that no-one is commanded to build the temple does not necessitate
that it will never be built, only that no human will do so -- only God
himself will, as we have argued throughout (see, e.g., discussion of
Acts 7). Finally, the clear links between the prophesied end-time
restoration in Ezekiel 20:33--44 and 40 -- 48 demonstrates also the
latter's eschatological
nature.[31](#appen11.html#NFIN658){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN658-1 .apnf}

Despite some minor disagreements with Block's view, we believe that his
view of an ideal temple could be combined with an eschatological
approach. Ezekiel portrays what Israelites at that point in redemptive
history could have considered an ideal blueprint or perfect prototype of
the temple. The temple was expressed in ideal concrete terms 'and yet
these were merely the forms in which the
[]{#chap11.html#page_347}general principles of God's activity were
enshrined' (Taylor 1969:
253).[32](#appen11.html#NFIN659){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN659-1 .apnf} The
vision represented what God stood for, what he required and, therefore,
what could additionally find more concrete realization in the dawning
eschatological age: e.g., (1) God's eternal presence with his restored
people; (2) the centrality of worship (expressed in the detailed
observance of rites); (3) the protection of God's people from fatal
contamination from impurity (this is the significance of the focus on
measuring sacred space); (4) the blessings of God's presence that will
go out to give life to the entire earth ('the river of
life').[33](#appen11.html#NFIN660){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN660-1 .apnf}

Somewhat differently than Block, Steven Tuell sees Ezekiel 40 -- 42 as
an amplification of Ezekiel 11:16b ('I \[God\] was a sanctuary for them
\[exiled Israel\] a little while'): through the prophet's communication
of the vision to the exiles they are given access to this heavenly
reality (Tuell 1996: 664). This is close to my view, but, like Block's,
it falls short in taking seriously enough the eschatological
interrelationships within the book and elsewhere in prophetic
literature. Nevertheless, one could see Ezekiel 40 -- 48 as a
subsequent, latter-day phase of the earlier heavenly sanctuary which had
been described in Ezekiel 11:16 to be in the midst of the exiles. As a
result of Ezekiel 11:16, a precedent has now been set within the book of
Ezekiel that God's 'temple presence' can be experienced apart from the
physical temple complex of
Israel.[34](#appen11.html#NFIN661){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN661-1 .apnf} In
addition, one other passage preceding that of chapters 40 -- 48 contains
a similar notion. Ezekiel 28:12--18 depicts the Garden of Eden as a
'sanctuary' (v. 18), despite the fact there was no structural building
there\![35](#appen11.html#NFIN662){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN662-1 .apnf} It
was God's presence that made the Garden the first temple. Chapters 11
and 28 are especially significant as precedents for a non-material
temple in Ezekiel 40 -- 48, since we have seen earlier in this chapter
that these two prior segments are explicitly developed in the book's
last vision!

In addition to denying that Ezekiel's temple is eschatological, Block
also does not believe that Revelation 21 is its fulfilment because of
several differences between the two (Block 1998: 503). Though
[]{#chap11.html#page_348}Block may be correct, the differences do not
appear to be substantial enough to deny that Revelation 21 fulfils
Ezekiel. First, the two cities are given different names ('Yahweh is
there' versus the 'new Jerusalem'). But the concepts of both names are
true of both cities. In fact, Revelation 21:2 develops 3:12: 'I will
write on him \[the 'overcomer'\] the name of My God, and the name of the
city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven . . .'
This actually recalls Ezekiel 48:35, where the 'name of the city' of the
new Jerusalem is called 'the Lord is there' because he has established
his latter-day temple in its midst in which his glory will reside
eternally.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN663){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN663-1 .apnf}

A second difference Block notes between the cities is that Ezekiel's is
square in shape and John's cubic. However, fulfilments do not have to be
photographic reproductions of Old Testament prophecy. Furthermore, a
square and a cube *are* similar in shape. In fact, Revelation 21:16 uses
the word 'four-square' (*tetragōnos*) to describe the temple-city in
dependence on
Ezekiel.[37](#appen11.html#NFIN664){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN664-1 .apnf} The
reason that John's picture of the new Jerusalem is four-square is
because he combines Ezekiel's vision with an allusion to the cubic shape
of the holy of holies from Solomon's temple (1 Kgs. 6:20 \[esp.
[LXX]{.small}\]) (see Caird 1966: 272--273).

Third, Block says that Ezekiel's temple is composed of common stones,
whereas the temple in Revelation is made up of precious stones. In fact,
Ezekiel does not comment about the precise kind of stones making up the
foundation and walls of the temple. They may well contain precious
stones.

Block's fourth objection is that Ezekiel's temple is at the centre of
everything, whereas the temple's existence is denied in
Revelation 21:22. But only the physical temple's existence is denied.
The true temple, that is, God and the Lamb, is now central: 'And I saw
no \[physical\] temple in it \[the new Jerusalem\] because the Lord God,
the Almighty, and the Lamb are its temple' (21:22). The equation of God
and the Lamb with the temple approaches closely the essence of the
Ezekiel vision, which is God's glorious presence itself (e.g., 48:35,
'the name of the city' is 'the Lord is there'). All that Israel's old
temple pointed to, the expanding presence of God, has been fulfilled in
Revelation 21:1 -- 22:5, and such a fulfilment has been anticipated
within Ezekiel 40 -- 48 itself.

[]{#chap11.html#page_349}Fifth, Block notes that Ezekiel portrays a
parochially Israelite city and Revelation 21 a cosmopolitan place of
Jews and Gentiles. The former, however, does picture Gentiles in the new
Jerusalem (47:22--23), though this probably would have been understood
as Gentiles who convert to the faith of Israel and who adopt the
corresponding national badges. In reality, Revelation 21 depicts
believing Jews and Gentiles as true
Israel.[38](#appen11.html#NFIN665){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN665-1 .apnf}

Sixth, Block contrasts the sacrificial animals that are at the heart of
Ezekiel's temple with the living Lamb at the heart of John's temple.
This may not be so much of a contrast, but only a difference in
prophetic perspective. We have already proposed that Ezekiel may have
chosen to employ the language and imagery of the temple familiar to his
readers to prophesy a far off and not so clearly seen eschatological
reality. The preceding point about Israelite parochialism is relevant
here: Ezekiel's readers likely understood that Gentiles would become
part of Israel by trusting in Yahweh and demonstrating that trust
through moving to Jerusalem, being circumcised, obeying the Law,
worshipping at the temple, submitting to dietary laws of clean and
uncleanness, and so on. The New Testament, including Revelation,
declares that Gentiles become true Israelites by believing in Jesus
(e.g., Eph. 3:6), identifying with and moving to him as true Israel
(e.g., Heb. 12:22--24), being circumcised in him (Col. 2:11),
worshipping in him as the true temple (1 Pet. 2:4--9) and becoming
'clean' only in
him.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN666){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN666-1 .apnf}

Finally, Block observes that in the Ezekiel temple there is still a need
to distinguish between the clean and unclean, but there is no longer any
such distinction within Revelation's temple. This is not just a problem
in comparison to Revelation; it also does not fit with Block's
alternative notion of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 as an 'ideal' temple.
Furthermore, we will argue in a following excursus that while Ezekiel's
temple portrays end-time conditions, these conditions are part of an
inaugurated, but not a consummated, eschatology. If this is the case,
then the problem of distinguishing pure from impure in Ezekiel's temple
can be explained as characterizing a new but still imperfect temple.
Indeed, Paul's understanding of the *beginning* fulfilment of the temple
described in Ezekiel 37:26--28 involves an ongoing need to 'not touch
what is unclean' (2 Cor. 6:17) and to 'cleanse' oneself 'from all
defilement of flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1; []{#chap11.html#page_350}so
also 1 Cor. 6:18--19). Perhaps, Ezekiel's enigmatic sacrifices also
could be understood along these lines. We have found that John also
alludes to the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 temple and applies it both to an
inaugurated stage of fulfilment (Rev. 11:1--4) and to a consummated
stage (Rev. 21:1 -- 22:5). In fact, Revelation 11:1--4 pictures
believers as priests making sacrifices in the 'outer court' through
suffering for their faith (Beale 1999a: *in loc.* on 11:1--2).

In light of these considerations, Block's objections to Revelation 21
being the final fulfilment of the Ezekiel vision are possible but not
decisive. Consequently, the picture of Ezekiel's temple that is
integrated into Revelation 21:1 -- 22:5 probably indicates its
*consummated* fulfilment. The new heavens and earth are the holy of
holies, as well as the new Jerusalem and new Eden, all of which are
anticipated to varying degrees in the last segment of the book of
Ezekiel.

The broad structure of the city from 21:12 -- 22:5 is based on the
vision of Ezekiel 40 -- 48. Ezekiel 40 -- 44 prophesies the pattern of
the final temple, and Ezekiel 45 -- 48 primarily depicts the future
arrangement of the eschatological city and the divisions of the land
around the temple compound. Revelation 21:12 -- 22:5 further interprets
the yet-future fulfilment of Ezekiel by collapsing temple, city and land
into one end-time picture portraying the one reality of God's communion
with his people. This identification is apparently based on Ezekiel's
own identification of temple, city and land as representing the same
truth, though Ezekiel never collapses the three explicitly in the manner
that Revelation 21:9 -- 22:5 does. Ezekiel explains the inheritance of
land and the final sanctuary to be indications of God's 'everlasting
covenant of peace', in which his 'dwelling place also will be with'
Israel (Ezek. 37:25--28; so also 43:7, 9 with respect to the
significance of the temple). The concluding statement of the Ezekiel 40
-- 48 vision likewise interprets the ultimate meaning of the renovated
city to be God's presence with his people: cf. 48:35, 'the name of the
city from that day \[will be\], "the L[ORD]{.small} is there."'

Our present purposes do not necessitate a detailed listing and
discussion of all the various allusions to Ezekiel and their specific
uses in John's final vision, since this has been done elsewhere (see
Beale 1999a: 1030--1117 *passim*). Nevertheless, a brief overview is in
order.[40](#appen11.html#NFIN667){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN667-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap11.html#page_351}Given the many parallels between the Revelation
and Ezekiel passages, the only logical way to contend that Revelation 21
does not prophetically fulfil Ezekiel is to argue that John uses the
numerous allusions to Ezekiel merely in an analogical manner. We have
contended, on the other hand, that John's temple is like Ezekiel's
because *it is*, in fact, what Ezekiel prophesied. This judgment is
based not only on the many similarities between the two, but also on our
assessment that Ezekiel 40 -- 48 itself was a prophecy of an
eschatological temple (with which most OT commentators would agree), and
John's temple depicts the eschatological temple. If John's vision does
not show the fulfilment of Ezekiel, then there is no other Old or New
Testament passage recording such a fulfilment. If Revelation 21 -- 22 is
the fulfilment, then Ezekiel's temple is not to be established in a
temporary 'millennial' period, but in the
[]{#chap11.html#page_352}eternal new heavens and earth, which is the
setting of John's final vision.

In conclusion, it is best not to formulate the debate about Ezekiel's
temple in a 'literal versus non-literal' framework. The question of
whether or not the future literal temple will take the basic material
and architectural form of Israel's first two temples is a better way to
address the issue. Our contention has been that the presence of God
filling the whole new creation is the 'literal' reality to which
Israel's first two temples pointed. Indeed, all along, these
architectural temples were but copies or reflections of the heavenly
temple.[42](#appen11.html#NFIN669){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN669-1 .apnf} I
have attempted to show that Ezekiel's portrayal already anticipated such
a heavenly temple established on earth. We have seen that other Old
Testament texts prophesied more explicitly than Ezekiel a non-material
and non-localized latter-day
temple.[43](#appen11.html#NFIN670){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN670-1 .apnf}
Similar observations have been made about the Garden of Eden as a
non-structural temple (Gen. 2; Ezek. 28:18), as well as the informal
small-scale sanctuaries of the patriarchs and Mount Sinai itself.

But even if Ezekiel's eschatological temple were best read from an Old
Testament reader's perspective according to the general pattern of
Israel's earlier temples, then the progressive revelation of the New
Testament would indicate that its fulfilment was not in a localized
physical temple. Nevertheless, such an apparently different fulfilment
in 'form' is essentially the same in 'content'.

The earlier illustration of a father's promise in 1900 to a young son is
relevant again. The father promises to give the son a horse and buggy
when he grows up and marries. During the early years of expectation, the
son reflects on the particular size of the buggy, its contours and
style, its beautiful leather seat and the size and breed of horse that
would draw the buggy. Perhaps the father had knowledge from early
experimentation elsewhere that the invention of the automobile was on
the horizon, but coined the promise to his son in terms that his son
would understand. Years later, when the son marries, the father gives
the couple an automobile, which has since been invented and
mass-produced. Is the son disappointed in receiving a car instead of a
horse and buggy? Is this not a 'literal' fulfilment of the promise? In
fact, the essence of the father's word has remained the same: a
convenient mode []{#chap11.html#page_353}of transportation. What has
changed is the precise form of transportation promised. The progress of
technology has escalated the fulfilment of the pledge in a way that
could not have been conceived of when the son was young. Nevertheless,
in the light of the later development of technology, the promise is
viewed as 'literally' and faithfully carried out in a greater way than
earlier apprehended.

Likewise, the purpose of the temple in the Old Testament and the purpose
of the expected end-time temple was to house God's glory, before which
his people were to worship. Some prophecies may have been conceived of
as referring to a small-scale structure that would encase the divine
glory. However, their fulfilment revealed that the entire recreated
cosmos and not a manmade building would be the physical temple housing
God's glory instead of a little building in a small part of the earth.
Both the Old Testament and eschatological temples are 'physical', and
hence 'literal', but the 'form' of the sacred containers of the divine
glory is quite different. In both cases, God's glory inhabits a temple,
but in the former its expression is limited, while in the latter it
shines forth in unfettered manner.

The preceding illustration also serves as probably the best conceptual
model for understanding the sacrifices in Ezekiel's temple. The
'essential content' of the prophesied sacrifices are fulfilled but the
'form' is expressed differently. What appears in Ezekiel to be animal
sacrifices, which formerly could give only incomplete and temporary
covering for sin, find escalated realization in Christ's sacrifice,
which provides eternal 'covering' for sin. Therefore, to say that Christ
actualizes Ezekiel's sacrifices as the Lamb sacrificed for sin is not a
figurative or spiritualizing use of the Old Testament, but the
eschatological reality to which the animal sacrifices foreshadowed
(following Clowney 1972: 177, 182--183). John himself elsewhere draws
such a connection between the Passover sacrifice (Exod. 12:46; Num.
11:12) and Christ's sacrificial death (John 19:36)!

## Conclusion {.int_niv1}

On the basis of cumulative evidence, we have reached the conclusion that
Ezekiel 40 -- 48 is a figurative vision of a real heavenly temple that
would descend and be established on earth in non-structural form in the
latter days. This conclusion is based on cumulative evidence from inside
and outside the book of Ezekiel. The conclusion also 'fits' well with
the biblical-theological patterns of the Garden of Eden and of the
temple explored in the preceding chapters of the book. Though
[]{#chap11.html#page_354}the constraints of the present project have not
allowed thorough analysis, I have outlined the approach towards
Ezekiel's temple which I think is most viable.

## Excursus: further reflections on the nature of Ezekiel's vision of the temple {.int_niv1}

This excursus contains tentative proposals that I have not found argued
hitherto, but which need more exploration and substantiation than the
limits of this study allow. Nevertheless, they are included here because
I think they may well be on the right track, and they fit well into the
overall argument of this chapter and book.

### Omitted features of Ezekiel's temple that point beyond a localized earthly temple {.int_niv2}

There are still yet more features of Ezekiel's temple vision that appear
to correspond better to a non-material building than to a physical one.
An initial impression of an unusual temple portrayal is that it lacks
the following significant elements that were in the Solomonic and second
temples: (1) the large bronze basin (called the 'bronze sea') in the
courtyard; (2) a golden lampstand; (3) the table of show-bread; (4) the
altar of incense in the holy
place;[44](#appen11.html#NFIN671){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN671-1 .apnf} (5)
the veil separating the holy of holies; (6) the high priest to serve
either in the holy place or in the holy of holies; (7) the anointing
oil; (8) the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies; (9) covering
cherubim in the holy of
holies.[45](#appen11.html#NFIN672){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN672-1 .apnf} In
addition, though the altar of sacrifice is present, its description has
changed: it is to be approached by steps from the east instead of by its
former approach on a ramp from the
south.[46](#appen11.html#NFIN673){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN673-1 .apnf} Also
[]{#chap11.html#page_355}lacking is any mention of an evening sacrifice
and a Day of Atonement, the latter of which was central to the Levitical
sacrificial system (C.L. Feinberg 1971: 103).

It is certainly possible that the missing items are simply not
mentioned, but are assumed to be in the temple. Accordingly, Ezekiel may
be focusing on defining sacred space and not the rituals carried out in
that space, since they would be tangential to the point of the
discussion. Thus, the accoutrements of ritual would be omitted only
because of focusing on something else. It seems improbable, however,
that these absent items are merely not noted because of a different
focus, and are assumed to be in the temple. I have so far come across no
persuasive reasons proposed for such a highlighting of sacred space in
which the objects of ritual are assumed to remain. But whatever view one
holds about the missing items, it involves an argument from silence.
Arguments from silence are difficult to prove or disprove. Therefore,
whatever position is finally taken on this issue will be difficult to
substantiate.

Nevertheless, I believe reasons other than a change in focus can be
offered for why the ritualistic items are not mentioned. More than
likely, they are not mentioned because, indeed, they are not present.
One reason for this may be that the repeated focus on both sacred space
*and* the 'measuring' of that space probably connotes, at least, the
notion of the security of worshippers in the temple and of protection of
the worshippers from the fatal contamination of impurity or
idolatry.[47](#appen11.html#NFIN674){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN674-1 .apnf}
This does not rule out the possibility of sacred furniture also being
present, but it makes the importance of such items less weighty.

Another reason for considering the items to be absent is that Ezekiel's
description of the temple is in fact longer than the depiction of the
interior of Solomon's temple, which included the articles not found in
Ezekiel. Likewise, the account of the tabernacle's design in Exodus
includes all the sacred furniture mentioned in Solomon's temple.
Further, it would be speculative to attach much significance to
[]{#chap11.html#page_356}only one or two lacking elements. When,
however, at least, *nine* major features of Israel's traditional temple
complex are missing in the description, the cumulative effect of their
absence points to the need of some other explanation than simply
positing that they were present but not important to mention merely
because of a different focus.

In addition, as we have seen earlier, Jeremiah 3:16--17, states that
there would be no 'ark of the covenant of the L[ORD]{.small}' in the
future temple but that God's ruling presence would extend over all of
Jerusalem and not be contained within the confines of the old holy of
holies.[48](#appen11.html#NFIN675){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN675-1 .apnf} This
confirms that Ezekiel's omission of the ark is not due to a different
literary focus, but because the ark is really absent! Thus, if the most
crucial piece of the temple's furniture was missing, it should not be
surprising that other less significant appurtenances should also be
absent.[49](#appen11.html#NFIN676){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN676-1 .apnf} We
will suggest below that the 'bronze sea' and the 'lampstand' are missing
because, like the ark (symbolic of the divine presence), the realities
they represented have also moved out of their former temple boundaries.

Some 'literalist' interpreters acknowledge that most of these items are
truly absent, the reason being that Christ has fulfilled
them.[50](#appen11.html#NFIN677){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN677-1 .apnf} For
example, the 'bronze sea' laver is no longer present because Christ's
blood has washed sins
away.[51](#appen11.html#NFIN678){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN678-1 .apnf} The
absence of the table of showbread indicates that Christ is the true
bread. The missing lampstand is due to Christ's coming as the light of
the world. The veil is lacking because Christ has shown himself to be
the entrance to God's presence. The holy of holies without an ark
indicates that Christ himself will sit on a throne and rule in that
inner sanctum.

In the light of the New Testament, this analysis could be the right
approach, since it is as viable an attempt to account for the absent
items as the explanation that claims the items are not mentioned only
because of a focus on sacred space. Nevertheless, even though the
explanations of these fulfilments could be theologically correct as far
as they go, there is nothing in either testament that would support
[]{#chap11.html#page_357}many of these links
exegetically.[52](#appen11.html#NFIN679){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN679-1
.apnf} Furthermore, these proposed fulfilments do not attempt to
recognize the cosmic symbolism of the various items in the temple and
then how these could be linked to New Testament fulfilment.

Nevertheless, even some interpreters who recognize the fulfilment of
these temple items in Christ still affirm that everything else in
Ezekiel's depiction of the temple will be built in a strictly physical
and structural manner (Schmitt and Laney 1997: 141--152). The threefold
broad structure of outer courts, holy place and holy of holies will be
built as portrayed.[53](#appen11.html#NFIN680){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN680-1
.apnf} But, with regard to the missing temple items, something more
radical seems to be afoot.

The missing items formed the symbolic heart of the old temple. Any
future temple structure would be rather empty and useless without them,
especially without the ark of the covenant, which was inextricably
linked to God's presence. Our study in chapter 2 of the cosmic symbolism
of these items suggests here that their absence could signal to the
reader that this is no vision of a material structure. Recall that the
three main parts of the temple symbolized the three parts of the cosmos:
visible earth and sea (= outer court), visible heavens (= holy place)
and invisible heavenly dimension (= holy of holies). To have some of the
symbolic items in each of these sections missing suggests a significant
alteration in the way the future temple was to be conceived. Is this
change a mere alteration of furniture or a greater transformation in the
essence of the temple that signifies a change in the cosmos itself?
Could it be that a missing symbolic item in each section of the temple
indicates that the corresponding cosmic reality which that section
represented has been altered in some way? The cumulative effect of
having nine items absent throughout the three sections of the temple
suggests that this may, in fact, be the case.

If our symbolic understanding throughout this study so far is correct,
then the essential parts of the cosmos symbolized by the items from the
old temple are no longer symbolized in Ezekiel's temple. This means that
the altered features in the new temple symbolize some kind of alteration
in the future cosmos. What is the nature of that alteration? We have
noted that some commentators []{#chap11.html#page_358}have seen that the
change is due to Christ fulfilling some aspects of the temple. But in
fact, this fulfilment needs to be understood as more radical in nature
than only pertaining to an individual believer's spiritual salvation.

The result of our overall study so far indicates that Christ is not
merely fulfilling the various absent holy items by providing individual
'salvation', but his first coming would even begin to alter the very
shape and composition of the cosmos. The reason is that his resurrection
was the beginning of a new creation, which we have seen is also spoken
of in terms of a temple (e.g., John 2:19--22). A new world has begun to
emerge in Christ, as has a new temple. The complete alteration of the
cosmos will be consummated at Christ's final coming. Even without
considering New Testament data, the changes in Ezekiel could well have
represented to the Old Testament reader some future alteration in the
cosmos.

Therefore, the lack of these items in Ezekiel's temple seems to point to
a metamorphosis of the temple and thus of the creation that the temple
symbolizes. Put another way, because there will be a significant
transformation of the cosmos in the eschatological future, the temple
that symbolizes that altered cosmos also must be changed. Just as if a
child were to pick up a small doll's house and shake it and some of the
furniture were to fall out, so God's shaking of his cosmic house in the
eschatological future may be symbolized by Ezekiel's altered temple with
missing pieces. For example, the absence of the sea (= absence of the
bronze laver) and the heavenly light sources (= absence of the lampstand
and the starry needlework of the veil) may indicate such a cosmic
shake-up. The absence of the veil (dividing the holy place from the
inner sanctuary), and especially the ark, may indicate that there has
also been a change in the invisible dimension of the cosmos: God's
heavenly holy of holies presence has begun to break out into the visible
world, which the New Testament indicates begins with the coming of
Christ. The lack of a mediatorial human high priest and an altar of
incense[54](#appen11.html#NFIN681){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN681-1 .apnf} also
signifies virtually the same reality.

If one acknowledges that these items are absent because Christ has
fulfilled them, then is it not likely that the overall structure itself
has been completely surpassed in Christ because the New Testament also
makes it abundantly clear that Christ's resurrection was the rebuilding
of the temple? In fact, the New Testament, as we have observed,
[]{#chap11.html#page_359}is just as clear about Christ being the
fulfilment of the entire temple as it is about him fulfilling some of
its parts.[55](#appen11.html#NFIN682){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN682-1 .apnf}

There is, however, a problem with the preceding analysis because it
affirms only a partial shake-up of the cosmos and not a complete,
definitive one. If Ezekiel pictures an ideal temple in the eternal new
creation, then our interpretation of a provisionally adjusted temple
appears inadequate to describe an eternal condition. Our approach is
even more inadequate, of course, if Ezekiel's picture is of a physically
ideal temple. Perhaps this last difficulty is partly solved by
understanding that prophets typically 'depict the future in terms which
make sense to its present' and 'clothe the purposes of God' in the
thought-forms of the contemporary culture and learned tradition (so
Bauckham 1993: 450--451). Accordingly, Ezekiel may well have prophesied
the end-time temple through the traditional symbols of a material temple
that Israelites at the time would have understood. In this regard, he
portrays an altered temple to highlight in part that this will be a
different kind of temple. The progressive revelation of the New
Testament makes clearer just how different the eschatological temple was
to be: it was not, in fact, to be a building but it was to be fulfilled
by the divine Messiah dwelling in the midst of his people. This approach
of seeing a provisionally altered temple would also solve the problem
that there is still a need to maintain a distinction between clean and
unclean in Ezekiel's temple. This distinction would only confirm our
proposal of the provisional nature of the prophesied new temple.

The perspective of progressive revelation may well solve how what
appears to be incomplete or temporary is ultimately fulfilled in
something that is perfect. This may well be the correct perspective. In
fact, however, the solution may lie in a somewhat different direction.
We have contended at the outset of this discussion that Ezekiel 40 -- 48
foresees a figurative vision of a heavenly temple that will descend to
earth at the eschaton. This does not mean that what he sees is the
'ideal' or 'perfect' view of the future temple. The observation that a
temple structure is still seen with a visible court and inner holy place
suggests that the redemptive-historical purpose of the temple has not
yet been reached. The adjusted arrangement of the heavenly temple is,
nevertheless, plausibly a result of the inauguration, but not
necessarily consummation, of the eschatological age. The prophet does
not see the consummated form of the temple, since we have noted
[]{#chap11.html#page_360}throughout that the completed stage of the
temple will be so extensive that it will be equated with the cosmos
itself.[56](#appen11.html#NFIN683){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN683-1 .apnf} The
consummation will occur when the heavenly temple descends completely to
fill the earth and transform it. The heavenly temple's former extension
to the holy of holies will be widened to include the whole earth. Thus,
Ezekiel's depiction of a provisionally adjusted temple may well describe
the inaugurated form of the latter-day temple.

Another indication that Ezekiel 40 -- 48 depicts an eschatological
temple (at least in inaugurated form) is the relationship of the absent
lampstand and bronze sea to two items in
chapter 47.[57](#appen11.html#NFIN684){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN684-1 .apnf}
First, the original 'tree of life' in Genesis has become multiplied into
'trees for food', and having 'leaves for healing'
(47:12).[58](#appen11.html#NFIN685){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN685-1 .apnf}
Quite possibly the lampstand is no longer in the holy place because its
redemptive-historical symbolism has begun to be fulfilled. Recall that
the lampstand signified the tree of life from Eden. If the two are,
indeed, to be equated, then the absence of this symbol from the holy
place and its placement outside of the temple may signify that its
expanding latterday goal is commencing. God's presence, partially
symbolized by the lampstand, is going out into the world. Similarly,
Revelation 22:2 pictures 'the tree of life' as a giant tree or as a
grove 'on either side of the river', bringing healing, and only two
verses later John says, 'they shall not have need of the light of a
lamp' (22:5a). Hence, no lampstand is depicted in the Revelation 21 --
22 vision. The ultimate reason for this is that 'the Lord God shall
illumine them' (22:5b), and it is his presence that brings the healing
symbolized by the 'tree of life'.

Likewise, recall that the 'bronze sea' symbolized part of the visible
earth that would be engulfed by God's presence in the end-time. Could it
be that this item is absent from the courtyard because the water from
this temple now flows and becomes a massive river that feeds into 'the
Great Sea' and
'heals'[59](#appen11.html#NFIN686){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN686-1 .apnf} its
waters (47:9--10)? Again, could it be that another cultic eschatological
cosmic symbol has passed away because God's end-time healing presence
has moved beyond the temple and []{#chap11.html#page_361}invaded the
world and is renewing it? Revelation 21:1 may correspond to the missing
'sea' in the courtyard of Ezekiel's temple: when the 'new heaven and a
new earth' appear, 'there is no longer any sea'. Therefore, the missing
lampstand and sea in Revelation 21 -- 22 is due to the cosmic shake-up
of the old world and the creation of a new world; thus, confirming our
same conclusion about the same missing objects in Ezekiel's temple. If
this is a correct reading of Ezekiel and Revelation, then we may deduce
without too much speculation that the other unmentioned items in
Ezekiel's temple are missing in order to indicate a radical change in
the future cosmos.

The viability of reading Ezekiel's temple in this way is suggested by
John's interpretation of it in Revelation 11:1--4. As we argued above in
chapter 10 and will elaborate on further in chapter 12, John portrays
the church as the inaugurated but not yet consummated endtime temple.
Believers are identified spiritually as being priests serving in the
temple holy place, and part of their service is to function as a
'lampstand' of witness, shining the light of God's presence out to the
world. Furthermore, John identifies the physical side of the church as
the 'outer court', where it offers itself in sacrifice to the Lord by
suffering for its witness in the world. It is obvious that this is not
formally the same description as Ezekiel's, but both prophets speak of
an inaugurated latter-day temple that is significantly different from
the old temple. Accordingly, Revelation 11 depicts part of the
inaugurated fulfilment of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 and Revelation 21:1ff. the
consummated fulfilment.

### Omitted features in other heavenly temple visions and their bearing on Ezekiel's vision {.int_niv2}

Like the account just given about the reason for the missing cultic
furniture, the following discussion must be considered provisional until
further research is carried out, which the limits of the present work
cannot allow. As a supplement or alternative to the directly preceding
analysis, our earlier conclusion that understanding Ezekiel 40 -- 48 as
a vision of a *heavenly* temple explains the absent items omitted in its
narration. As in Ezekiel's vision, visions of heavenly temples in the
Old Testament, in early Judaism and in the New Testament do not describe
furniture in the temple with the exception of the divine throne, which
was never a piece of furniture in the earthly temple
anyway.[60](#appen11.html#NFIN687){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN687-1 .apnf} Old
[]{#chap11.html#page_362}Testament visions of the heavenly temple also
depict only a throne and live cherubim or other heavenly beings around
it (Ezek. 1; Is. 6:1--6; Dan. 7:9--10, 13--14; 1 Kgs. 22:19--23).

One of the most extensive depictions of a heavenly temple is *1 Enoch*
14:8--25, which, we observed earlier, portrays Enoch touring through a
heavenly outer court, holy place and then peering into the holy of
holies. Not one piece of traditional furniture is mentioned, and no
cultic appurtenances are described in the outer court. As Enoch enters
the holy place, he says explicitly that 'there was nothing inside'
(14:13). Then he describes the inner sanctum, which has only a 'lofty
throne' with God sitting on it, which is a partial allusion to Ezekiel
1:15--21, 26. Other similar visions in Judaism likewise describe only a
throne or God's presence surrounded by angels. One of the most striking
among these is the Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls) *Songs of Sabbath
Sacrifice* (4Q400--407). Again, no sacred furniture is described, only
heavenly beings surrounding God, although it is interesting that the
heavenly beings themselves are sometimes portrayed as forming the
structure of the temple itself. This is a pertinent reference because
the portrayal makes much allusion to Ezekiel 40 -- 48 (as observed
earlier in this chapter). Other similar passages in Judaism also picture
no traditional furniture in the heavenly temple (*1 Enoch* 71:5--10;
*Prayer of Azariah* 1:31--38; *3 Enoch* 1:1--12; 7).

The most extended heavenly temple vision in the New Testament is that in
John's Apocalypse. Throughout Revelation 4 -- 21 the throne of God or
the Lamb, usually surrounded by heavenly beings, is portrayed in various
ways. The vision in Revelation 4 -- 5 is greatly indebted to the prior
visions of Ezekiel 1, Daniel 7 and Isaiah 6, and the chapter 21 temple
vision is heavily dependent on Ezekiel 40 -- 48. Significantly, neither
of these two extended visions in Revelation contains any furniture,
except a throne! Most other temple visions in the book have no
descriptions of heavenly 'furniture'.

There are, however, some furniture and sacred vessels mentioned in a few
of the temple visions of Revelation. Intriguingly, one of the two items
repeatedly mentioned is also found in Ezekiel's vision: an altar
(Rev. 6:9; 8:3--5; 9:13; 11:1). Even more interestingly, there is lack
of clarity about the identity and purpose of this altar in chapter 6 and
11 (see Beale 1999a: *in loc.*), just as we have seen that there is lack
of clarity in Ezekiel. There is virtual unanimous acknowledgment among
scholars that these depictions of an altar are figurative for some
heavenly reality. We will argue in a following chapter that, at least in
part (especially in 6:9 and 11:1), the altar symbolizes the
[]{#chap11.html#page_363}suffering destiny of God's people who follow
the Lamb by laying down their lives as sacrifices to God.
Revelation 11:1 is especially relevant since it alludes to the
'measuring' of Ezekiel's temple! The figurative nature of the incense
altar in 8:3--5 is apparent from noticing that the 'bowls' from which
the incense comes have been explicitly identified to be figurative: the
'golden bowls of incense, which are the prayers of the saints' (cf. 5:8
with 8:4).

One of the few other mentions of pieces of furniture in Revelation is in
11:19, where John sees that at the end of the age 'the temple of God
which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in
his temple . . .' A 'throne' is also sometimes pictured in these
visions. The word 'throne' occurs about thirty-five times in the book
(up to ch. 20), where it refers to God's or the Lamb's sovereign
dwelling in the heavenly
temple.[61](#appen11.html#NFIN688){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN688-1 .apnf}
Since this is a vision of a heavenly temple, the 'ark' is likely
figurative for God's rule, as are the many references to the 'throne'.
We have already noted that the 'ark' in Israel's temple was symbolic
itself for God's ruling
presence.[62](#appen11.html#NFIN689){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN689-1 .apnf}

The upshot of this discussion is that, *as a rule*, visions of heavenly
temples do not contain cultic furniture, and the exceptions to the rule
involve symbolic representations of such furniture. The Ezekiel temple
vision with its missing cultic features fits most naturally into this
genre of heavenly temple visions (Ezek. 1 and 40 -- 48, Is. 6 and 1 Kgs.
22 would represent the earliest forms of this genre). This evidence
points further to the viability of our overall argument that Ezekiel's
vision is of a heavenly temple and not a future earthly temple. It is
the heavenly form of the temple to which the faithful remnant was
spiritually related at the time Ezekiel himself was writing (see Ezek.
11:16),[63](#appen11.html#NFIN690){#chap11.html#ap_NFIN690-1 .apnf} and
it will be this heavenly temple that will begin to descend to earth in
the latter days.

More likely, however, as we have argued from a number of angles,
Ezekiel's temple is the heavenly temple of the latter days that is on
the verge of descending or, more preferably, has begun to come down. The
reason that heavenly temples do not contain the furniture of the earthly
temple is that, as we have found throughout our study, the earthly
temple was but a copy and reflection of the heavenly temple's reality,
and when an occasional item is seen in a heavenly temple, it is
[]{#chap11.html#page_364}obviously symbolic. In addition to this
difference in heavenly temples, Ezekiel's vision also is missing some
items possibly because the symbolic realities to which the old furniture
pointed have begun in some way to find their end-time realization.

# Theological conclusions: the physical temple as a foreshadowing of God's and Christ's presence as the true temple {.chap_tit}

::: dev
A not unusual method of argumentation throughout this entire study has
been to present several lines of evidence in support of an
interpretation. Some lines have been more compelling than others, but
the strategy has been that when all of the pertinent data is considered
together, the less convincing material becomes more significant than
when seen by itself. Consequently, it has, no doubt, sometimes been
discernible that some of the explanations in favour of a viewpoint have
not stood on their own, but it needs to be remembered that these weaker
points are aimed to take on more persuasive power when viewed in light
of the other lines of analysis. And, even when this may not be granted,
the broader design is that the overall weight of the cumulative
arguments point to the plausibility or probability for the main idea
being argued.

We now attempt to pull together the major biblical-theological points
made throughout our study. We will also suggest some further insights
that grow out of some of these concepts observed earlier.

::: {#chap12.html#niv1-051 .niv1}
## The consummate eschatological stage of the world-encompassing temple in Revelation 21:1 -- 22:5 {.int_niv1}

We return now to the question posed at the beginning of the book: why
does John see 'a new heavens and earth' in Revelation 21:1, while in
Revelation 21:2, 10--21 he sees a city that is garden-like, in the shape
of a temple? This is an interpretative and theological problem. John
[]{#chap12.html#page_366}does not describe all the contours and details
of the new creation; he portrays only an arboreal city-temple. Recall
that the dimensions and architectural features of the city in these
verses are drawn to a significant extent from Ezekiel 40 -- 48, which we
have seen is a prophecy of a future temple (cf., Rev. 3; 7; 11; 21:27 --
22:2; also ch. 11 on Ezek. 40 -- 48). The precious stones forming the
foundation (vv.18--21) clearly allude to the description of Solomon's
temple which also was overlaid with gold and whose foundation was
composed of precious
stones.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN691){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN691-1 .apnf}

How can we explain the apparent discrepancy that he saw a new heaven and
earth in verse 1 and then saw only a city in the shape and structure of
a temple in the remainder of the vision? It is possible, of course, that
he merely first sees the new world and then sees a city-temple *in* that
world. But this is not likely the solution because he seems to equate
the 'new heavens and earth' with the following description of the
'city-temple'. The following two paragraphs rehearse the evidence
adduced in the opening chapter in favour of this equation.

The equation becomes clearer, for example, when one reflects on
Revelation 21:27 that 'nothing unclean . . . shall ever come into' the
city-temple. Recall that in the Old Testament uncleanness was to be kept
out of the tabernacle or temple precincts (e.g., Num. 19:13, 20; 2 Chr.
23:19; 29:16). That the perimeters of the new city-temple of chapter 21
will finally encompass the whole of the new creation is suggested by
Revelation 21:27, which says that no uncleanness was allowed into the
urban temple, probably meaning that no uncleanness will be allowed into
the new world. This conclusion is further evident, since 22:15 says that
the unclean will be excluded from the city, so they will also be
excluded from dwelling in the new creation, since they will be in the
lake of fire for ever (see on 21:8; 22:15; cf. 21:27), and that lake is
certainly outside the bounds of the new creation.

Another observation that we have made points further to the equation of
the new cosmos with the city-temple. The 'seeing--hearing' pattern
elsewhere in Revelation, where what John sees is interpreted by what he
then hears (or vice versa), suggests that 21:1--3 refers to the same
reality. A classic example is Revelation 5:5 (John hears about a 'lion
from the tribe of Judah' who 'conquered'), and 5:6 interprets how the
messianic lamb has done so (he won victory ironically by dying as a
'slain lamb'). Revelation 21:1 commences, as we have seen, with
[]{#chap12.html#page_367}John's vision of a 'new heaven and new earth',
followed by his vision of the 'new Jerusalem descending from heaven' (v.
2). He then hears a 'great voice' (v. 3) proclaiming that 'the
tabernacle of God is with men, and he will tabernacle with them . . .'
It is likely that the second vision (v. 2) interprets the first and that
what is heard about the tabernacle (v. 3) more explicitly interprets
both verses. This is to say that the new creation of verse 1 is
identical to the 'new Jerusalem' of verse 2, and both represent the same
reality as the 'tabernacle' of verse 3.

A number of conclusions made throughout the preceding chapters further
support Revelation 21:1, 2 and 3 referring to equivalent realities. For
example, what substantiates John's equation of the new Jerusalem (v. 2)
with 'the tabernacle of God with men' and his 'dwelling with them' (v.
3) is that verse 3 is a combined allusion to Leviticus 26:11--12 and
Ezekiel 37:27. We have observed that the Ezekiel passage alludes to
Leviticus and clarifies its prophecy that God would make his 'dwelling
among you' to be God's tabernacling over the entire promised land of
Israel ('My dwelling place also will be *over* them'). The temple vision
of Ezekiel 40 -- 48, which expands on the prophecy of
37:26--28,[2](#appen11.html#NFIN692){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN692-1 .apnf}
concludes with a summary of its significance: 'the name of the city from
that day shall be, "The L[ORD]{.small} is there" ' (48:35). The capital
city of Israel especially will be covered by God's sacred presence, as
we have discovered also in
Isaiah 4:5--6[3](#appen11.html#NFIN693){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN693-1 .apnf}
and Jeremiah 3:16--17 (especially cf. Jer. 3:17 with Ezek. 48:35). We
saw in the previous chapter that the dimensions of Ezekiel's new temple
were to be the size of ancient Jerusalem itself. Ezekiel 40:2 also spoke
of a temple 'structure like a city' on top of 'a very high
mountain'[4](#appen11.html#NFIN694){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN694-1 .apnf}
(see also Rev. 21:10). Hence, Ezekiel predicts an enlargement of the
tabernacle to include Jerusalem and even the land of Israel. This has
already been hinted at by the use of Ezekiel 37:27 in Revelation 7:15,
where it had fulfilment in uncountable multitudes (cf. Rev. 7:9ff.) of
Jews and Gentiles.[5](#appen11.html#NFIN695){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN695-1
.apnf} What points to the tabernacle of Revelation 21:3 as also being
equivalent to the new earth of 21:1 is the []{#chap12.html#page_368}fact
that both Leviticus 26 and Ezekiel 37 view their temple prophecies as
developments of the Genesis 1:28 commission 'to be fruitful and
multiply, and fill the earth' (cf. Lev. 26:9; Ezek. 36:35--38).

That the 'new heaven and new earth' of 21:1 is defined by and equated
with the paradisal city-temple of 21:2 and 21:9 -- 22:5 is also pointed
to further, as we have seen, by J. D. Levenson's observation that
'heaven and earth' in the Old Testament may sometimes be a way of
referring to Jerusalem or its temple (1988: 89--90; 1984: 294--295). He
quotes Isaiah 65:17--18 as one of the texts most illustrative of this:
'*For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth*; and the former
things shall not be remembered or come to mind \[65:17\]. But be glad
and rejoice forever in what I create; *for behold, I create Jerusalem*
for rejoicing \[65:18\].' Revelation 21:1--2 follows the pattern of
Isaiah 65:17--18. Since Isaiah 65:17 is clearly alluded to in
Revelation 21:1, it is most natural to understand that the new Jerusalem
of 21:2 also echoes Isaiah 65:18 and is equated with the 'new heaven and
earth' of Revelation 21:1! In the light of the evidence even only of
this chapter so far, that the new creation in verse 1 and new Jerusalem
in verse 2 are interpreted in verse 3 to be 'the tabernacle of God'
among all humanity would also be a natural
equation,[6](#appen11.html#NFIN696){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN696-1 .apnf} a
conclusion also borne out by earlier chapters of our study.

Consequently, the new creation and Jerusalem are none other than God's
tabernacle, the true temple of God's special presence portrayed
throughout chapter 21. It was this divine presence that was formerly
limited to Israel's temple and has began to expand through the church,
and which will fill the whole earth and heaven, becoming coequal with
it. Then the eschatological goal of the temple of the Garden of Eden
dominating the entire creation will be finally fulfilled (so
Rev. 22:1--3). Hence, eschatology not only recapitulates the protology
of Eden but escalates it (see further Beale 1997: 11--52).

John, indeed, is equating the new cosmos with the arboreal city-temple.
But why does he make such an equation? Why does John not see a full
panorama of the new heavens and earth? It seems problematic at a first
or even second glance. Some might attribute the apparent discrepancy to
the irrational nature that visions and dreams can have, though this
would be hard to accept for a vision that John claims has its origin in
God (e.g., cf. 21:9 with Rev. 1:1 and
22:6).[7](#appen11.html#NFIN697){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN697-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap12.html#page_369}In order to solve this problem, we have
investigated throughout this book the meaning and role of the temple in
the Old Testament in order to discover its purpose, and then see how
such a purpose relates to the New Testament conception of the temple. It
has become evident in pursuing this task that the first tabernacle and
temple existed long before Israel became a nation. Indeed, it is
apparent that the first sanctuary is discernible from the very beginning
of human history. Adam's purpose in that first garden-temple was to
expand its boundaries until it circumscribed the earth, so that the
earth would be completely filled with God's glorious presence. Adam's
failure led, in time, to the re-establishment of the tabernacle and
temple in Israel. Both were patterned after the model of Eden and were
constructed to symbolize the entire cosmos in order to signify that
Israel's purpose as a corporate Adam was to extend its borders by
faithfully obeying God and spreading his glorious presence throughout
the earth.

The entire discussion of our study up to this point confirms the
conclusion that the temple in Revelation 21 -- 22 symbolically
represents the entire new cosmos because that was the goal of God's
temple-building process throughout sacred history. Chapters 21 -- 22
form the consummation of the prophetic hope of an end-time universal
temple, which Revelation 11 (as well as Rev. 1 -- 2, Eph. 2, 1 Pet. 2
and others) portrays as having begun fulfilment and as advancing to fill
the entire earth during this age in Christ and his church. Both
Revelation 11 and 21 -- 22 indicate various facets of the fulfilment of
the Ezekiel 40 -- 48 prophecy of the temple. These Revelation passages
also make reference to other Old Testament passages to explain how
Christ and the church are the realization of the end-time temple.

Therefore, the mystery of how John can see a new heavens and earth in
Revelation 21:1, but then see only a city in the form of a gardenlike
temple (21:2--3, 9 -- 22:5), is solved by discovering the purpose of the
temple throughout biblical history. His equation of the new cosmos with
the temple-city becomes natural, not strange. The new heavens and earth
are described as a temple because God's goal of universally expanding
the temple of his glorious presence will have come to pass. Everything
of which Old Testament temples were typologically symbolic, a
recapitulated and escalated Garden of Eden and whole cosmos, will have
finally been materialized. The holy of holies stood for the invisible
heavenly dimension of the cosmos where God dwelt; the holy place
represented the visible heavens; the outer court symbolized the visible
earth (land, sea, the place of human habitation). God's special presence
that was formerly confined to the holy of
[]{#chap12.html#page_370}holies, which was the essence of temple
reality, will at last encompass the whole new earth and heaven because
of the work of Christ. At the very end of time, the true temple will
come down from heaven and fill the whole creation, as
Revelation 21:1--3, 10 and 22 affirm.

Why does Revelation 21:18 say the city-temple will be pure gold? The
reason is that the entire 'holy of holies' of Israel's temple, which was
paved with gold on the walls, floor and ceiling (so 1 Kgs. 6:20--22; 2
Chr. 3:4--8), has been expanded to cover the whole earth. This is why
the three sections of Israel's old temple (holy of holies, the holy
place and then the outer courtyard) are no longer found in the
Revelation 21 temple -- because God's special presence, formerly limited
to the holy of holies, has now burst forth to encompass the whole earth.
This is also why Revelation 21:16 says the whole city was 'square' or
cubic -- because the holy of holies was such a shape (1 Kgs. 6:20). In
addition, that the entire creation has become the holy of holies is
evident from 22:4. Whereas the high priest, who wore God's name on his
forehead, was the only person in Israel who could enter the holy of
holies once a year and be in God's presence, in the future all of God's
people will become high priests with God's 'name on their foreheads' and
standing, not one day a year, but for ever in God's presence.

This last point is enhanced by observing that God's 'throne' is now in
the midst of God's people (see 22:1, 3) throughout the new creation,
whereas in the previous chapters of Revelation God's throne was only in
the heavenly temple.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN698){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN698-1
.apnf} Furthermore, the ark of the covenant in Israel's holy of holies
was viewed as Yahweh's 'footstool', to where his feet extended while
sitting on his heavenly throne (cf. Is. 66:1 with 2 Chr. 9:18; 1 Chr.
28:2; Ps. 99:5; 110:1; 132:7;
Acts 7:49).[9](#appen11.html#NFIN699){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN699-1 .apnf}
Only the high priest could enter once a year into the space where the
'footstool' was. In the new creation, all of God's people living
throughout the new world will be high priests always in the presence of
God because the dimensions of the heavenly holy of holies and God's
ruling presence, symbolized by his throne, have broken in and expanded
to include the entire new
cosmos.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN700){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN700-1 .apnf}

Towards the end of my research on this book, I found that
M.H. []{#chap12.html#page_371}Woudstra has come close to making the same
conclusion about the gigantic widening of the end-time temple. He
noticed, as we have seen, that Isaiah 4:5, Jeremiah 3:16--17 and Ezekiel
37:26--28 all refer to a future time when the blessings of paradise
return and the tabernacle will be extended over Jerusalem (though we
have seen that in Ezekiel 37 the tabernacle extends over the entire
promised land). The old temple 'will cease to be, simply because God
always intended the cultus to extend its categories on to the life of
the ordinary citizen' (Woudstra 1970: 99). Consequently, this is not so
much a fading away of the former temple institution but a fulfilment of
all to which it pointed and 'an accomplishment in becoming the city-wide
refuge that it was intended to be' (1970: 99). He further notes, 'the
purpose of the cultus, prior to that point in time, is therefore to
bring this great reality into being. Far from being a "withering away"
of the cultic institution . . . the opposite actually is the case. The
cultic establishment makes itself superfluous as a separate institution
by extending itself over the whole city area (1970: 98).

Woudstra then applies his Old Testament conclusions to Revelation 21 --
22:

::: cita
The tabernacle's highest realization is depicted in Revelation 21:3,
which describes the eschatological stage of the history of redemption .
. . the area of the temple is widened so as to become coextensive with
the entire city of Jerusalem. The very form of the sacred city, with its
length and breadth and height equal (Rev. 21:16), suggests that the new
Jerusalem will become one giant holy of holies. At the same time the
city symbolizes the shalom of paradise, with its river, and with the
tree of life. (1970:
100--101)[11](#appen11.html#NFIN701){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN701-1 .apnf}
:::

Woudstra stopped short of affirming that the temple is coextensive with
the entire cosmos since he stresses its equivalence only with the new
Jerusalem.[12](#appen11.html#NFIN702){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN702-1 .apnf}
Nevertheless, his notion that Ezekiel 37:26--28
[]{#chap12.html#page_372}points to a future time when the new Jerusalem
'will be all church' and 'coextensive with the life of the restored
people of God' (Woudstra 1970: 98--99) certainly leaves the way open for
the conclusion that I have made in equating the new cosmos with the city
in the form of the holy of
holies.[13](#appen11.html#NFIN703){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN703-1 .apnf}

As a result, the two outer sections of the temple (the holy place and
outer court representing respectively the visible sky and the earth)
have fallen away like a cocoon from which God's holy of holies presence
has emerged to dominate all creation. This is why Hebrews 9:8 says,
'that the way into the \[Holy of\] Holies *has not yet been manifested*
\[i.e., it has been blocked\] while the outer tabernacle \[the holy
place\] is still
standing'.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN704){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN704-1 .apnf}
The way was not blocked for Christ when he entered into the heavenly
holy of holies, and it will not be blocked for his people when they
consummately enter at the very end of the age. There is nothing in the
final new creation barricading the all-glorious presence of God from all
of his people. To expect the restoration of a physical temple after the
inaugurated new creation in Christ 'would be to offer new reason for
confidence in the flesh, to build again the wall of partition and to
destroy the unity of the people of God' (Clowney 1972: 177).

While I believe that the thesis about the ultimate redemptive-historical
and cosmic significance of the temple in relation to
Revela[]{#chap12.html#page_373}tion 21 -- 22 is correct, I am sure that
there are some who would doubt it, as no-one, to my knowledge, has
developed this view in the way or to the degree in which this study has
attempted to do.[15](#appen11.html#NFIN705){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN705-1
.apnf} I remain content to let the evidence of this book stand in the
face of such doubts. Therefore, it is no understatement to say that the
symbolism of the temple in both testaments is a highly significant
strand of biblical
theology.[16](#appen11.html#NFIN706){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN706-1 .apnf}

## Hermeneutical reflections on the theological relationship of the Old Testament temple to the temple in the New Testament {.int_niv1}

In this section, I will continue to attempt to draw together some of my
more important hermeneutical observations and conclusions made so far
throughout the study, especially as these bear upon the theology of the
temple.

### Further reflections on the book of Hebrews {.int_niv2}

We have seen in Hebrews that the heavenly sanctuary is called the 'true
tabernacle' because the earthly one was only a 'copy and shadow of the
heavenly' one (8:5a). Verse 5b confirms this: 'just as Moses is warned
when he was about to erect the tabernacle: for, "See . . . that you make
all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain"
'. The pattern seen by Moses on Sinai was a copy of the true heavenly
tabernacle that was to appear at the end of history. It was this
eschatological sanctuary of which Moses was to make a small earthly
model. This was the 'true tabernacle' because it was the 'genuine
article', the 'literal' and real one. In contrast, the earthly tent was
but 'a copy and shadow' or figurative portrayal of the literal heavenly
one (so also Heb. 9:24), 'the greater and more perfect tabernacle'
(Heb. 9:11).

Some Christian interpreters maintain that what is literal can be only
physical and what is non-literal is non-physical. The book of Hebrews,
however, gives an opposite definition: the 'figurative' sanctuary is the
earthly one, and the 'literal' sanctuary the heavenly one. Part of the
reason for this lies in the meaning of 'true' (*alēthinos*). The
reference to the tabernacle as 'true' in Hebrews 8:2 and 9:24 connotes
[]{#chap12.html#page_374}both (1) that which is 'genuine' or represents
'the real state of
affairs'[17](#appen11.html#NFIN707){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN707-1 .apnf} and
(2) prophetic fulfilment.

One of the best illustrations of such usage occurs in Revelation 3:14,
where Christ calls himself the 'faithful and *true* witness'. This means
that he is the 'perfect substance and model' of everything that
imperfect witnesses in the Old Testament should have been but failed to
be, yet who were still a foreshadowing of
Christ.[18](#appen11.html#NFIN708){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN708-1 .apnf} The
word 'true' in the Old Testament refers to that which really exists and
corresponds to reality (1 Sam. 9:6; 15:17; 1 Kgs. 10:6; 2 Chr. 9:5) and
'false' describes the opposite. Typically, a false witness or prophet
does not speak that which corresponds to reality, whereas the true
witness and prophet does (e.g., Num. 11:23; Deut. 13:2, 14; 17:4;
18:22).

Likewise, Hebrews refers to the heavenly tabernacle as 'true' because it
is the fulfilment not only of direct prophecies of the eschatological
temple but of everything the imperfect and temporary Old Testament
tabernacle and temples foreshadowed. All of these physical temples were
intended to be but models and copies of the coming true, eternal temple
(see again Heb. 8:5). That consummate temple cannot be changed nor can
it ever pass away, because it is not made by imperfect human hands but
by God's hand, as a new creation. Thus, we may say that the
eschatological temple is 'true' not only in the sense of fulfilment but
in that it will remain a reality for ever.

The former temple was not the 'true one', not only because it was a mere
shadow of the one to come but also because it would cease to exist. A
further reason for the eternal existence of the new temple in the new
creation is that it will exist in the midst of God's unfettered
presence, whereas God's special presence in the old cosmos was cordoned
off in a back room of the old temple. To believe that a physical temple
will be built after the eschatological one has been inaugurated would be
to return to the 'shadowy' stage of temple existence. Once the end-time,
eternal temple that corresponds to the reality of the heavenly one
comes, it would be bizarre for God to commend a return to the shadows.

To see Christ and the church as the true end-time temple is neither an
allegorical spiritualization of the Old Testament temple nor of
prophecies of an eschatological temple, but is an identification of the
temple's real meaning. While it is true that Christ fulfils what the
temple stands for, it is better to say, 'Christ is the meaning for which
[]{#chap12.html#page_375}the temple existed' (Clowney 1972: 177). This
is well expressed by Jesus himself when he says, 'something greater than
the temple is here' (Matt. 12:6).

Another reason why Hebrews says the literal temple is not the physical
but the heavenly one is because God's luminous presence could only be
imperfectly expressed there, as it was a human-made building. This, as
we have seen, is part of Stephen's point in Acts 7:48--49: 'the Most
High does not dwell in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says,
"Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet;/What
kind of house will you build for Me?" says the Lord;/"Or what place is
there for My repose?/Was it not My hand which made all these things?" '

### Further reflections on the significance of 'handmade' versus 'made without hands' {.int_niv2}

Israel's physical sanctuaries had been 'handmade' (Acts 7:44--47) and
could never be a permanent dwelling for God. Stephen's intent in quoting
Isaiah 66:1 is to show that, as God's own hand had created the first
world that had become tainted with idolatry (cf. Acts 7:44--47 with
7:41--43 in contrast to 7:50), so God would make a new, everlasting
cosmos, not by human hands but by his own hand (so Is. 65:17--19 and
66:22). This explains the reason that Solomon's temple was not the
ultimate fulfilment of the promise about David's son who would construct
for God a temple: Solomon's temple was 'handmade'. In addition to the
problem that a human-made structure was an inappropriate home for God's
presence, Israel compounded the problem by making her temples places of
idolatry. Since the divine judgment demanded the destruction of
idolatrous places and objects (e.g., Exod. 34:14; Deut. 7:5; 2 Kgs.
23:14; 2 Chr. 31:1; 34:4), Israel's holy places had to be destroyed.

We have also found in our study that the stone-mountain of Daniel 2 and
the eschatological temple are linked in that both are not made by human
hands. Again, it is the New Testament that repeatedly refers to the new,
end-time temple as 'not made with hands'. The picture in the Old
Testament corresponding closest to this is Daniel's stone 'cut out
without hands', referring to a new creational
temple.[19](#appen11.html#NFIN709){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN709-1 .apnf} In
this light, it is not surprising that Christ, the true temple,
identifies himself with the stone of Daniel (Luke 20:17--18 = Matt.
21:42). Hebrews 9:11 says that Christ entered 'through the greater and
more []{#chap12.html#page_376}perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
that is to say, not of this creation' (so also Heb. 9:24).

In this regard, Acts 17:24 states that 'the God who made the world and
all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell
in temples made with hands'. Paul says this after the great
redemptive-historical divide, when Christ and his people had begun to
replace Israel's 'handmade' temple. From this point on there could be no
human-made structures separating God and his people, in order that he
would dwell fully and unfettered with them. This is the reason that no
human can answer affirmatively God's question in Isaiah 66:1 about his
eschatological, eternal dwelling (quoted in Acts 7:49--50), 'Where then
is a house you could build for Me?' In this respect, it is natural that
in the New Testament 'handmade' refers to the old creation and 'made
without hands' alludes to the new creation, most specifically to the
resurrection state as the beginning of the new creation.

God's ultimate goal is to fill every part of his creation with his
presence because he is its creator. God's glorious presence could not
dwell completely in the old creation because it was a sin-sullied world.
Thus, his special revelatory presence dwelt in a limited way in
buildings made by humans. But, when he would fully redeem the world and
recreate it, he would dwell in the world in a fuller way than ever
before (so Rom. 8:18--25). Therefore, the new temple would be an
everlasting and perfect container for God's ubiquitous presence because
it would be without moral stain and would not be 'made with hands, that
is to say, not of this \[old\] creation' (Heb. 9:11). It is for this
reason that Revelation 21:22 says, 'I saw no \[structural\] temple' in
the new cosmos because 'the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are
its temple'. The earlier sanctuaries that were flawed vessels for
holding the divine presence 'are replaced by God and the Lamb in person,
so that unrestricted dealings with God are \[now\]
possible'.[20](#appen11.html#NFIN710){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN710-1 .apnf}

### The importance of the notion of 'extended meaning' {.int_niv2}

Reflection on the nature of how people, especially authors, communicate
will help us better perceive the nature of how biblical authors
communicate and how God communicates through them. This, of course, will
have important bearing on how the temple is to be understood throughout
various segments of biblical revelation.

The act of 'literal' communication, whether of biblical writers or any
human author, involves three aspects: (1) the content of the
[]{#chap12.html#page_377}utterance; (2) the manner in which the
utterance is made; (3) the intended effect of the
utterance.[21](#appen11.html#NFIN711){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN711-1 .apnf}
It is this second step, the various ways God communicates content
through human authors, that is the focus in this section. The ways
Scripture conveys content is through such literary forms as poetry,
parable, historical narrative, visionary apocalyptic, praise, mocking,
satire, irony, prophecy, wisdom sayings, and so on. Some literary forms
may only be discerned not from sentences or paragraphs but from
considering the completed literary work as a whole. In our case, some of
the divine forms of communication can only be discerned from considering
the completed canon as a whole (Vanhoozer 2001: 34--37). One such form
would be typology (on which see the example of John 19 below).

The biblical canon has similarities with other literary works which 'can
grow in meaning' as a result of original authors sensing a fuller,
potential meaning than they can express. This means that sometimes
authors consciously intend that their literary acts, their 'literal
sense', be open-ended or indeterminate, and other times such
indeterminateness is unconscious or implied. This may be called
'transhistorical intentions' or 'open-ended authorial intentions',
whereby an intended original meaning may go beyond the original content
spoken (Hirsch 1967: 125; 1984: 202--244). Authors may wish to include a
potential in what they say to extend meaning into the indefinite future
by espousing principles intended for an indefinite number of
applications. Or, alternatively, authors may be aware that their
original meaning has the potential to be recontextualized by subsequent
interpreters who ascertain creative applications of the meaning to new
contexts. In such cases a provision is made for subsequent readers to
interpret in a way that 'extends meaning'. Thus an original meaning is
so designed to tolerate some revision in cognitive content and yet not
be essentially
altered.[22](#appen11.html#NFIN712){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN712-1 .apnf}

E. D. Hirsch helpfully distinguishes between what he calls 'meaning' and
'significance', which has relevance for the present discussion. The
explanation of original, intentional, *verbal meaning* is distinct from
the 'significance' of that
meaning.[23](#appen11.html#NFIN713){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN713-1 .apnf} We
can compare an author's original, unchanging meaning to an apple in its
original context of an apple tree. When someone removes the apple and
puts []{#chap12.html#page_378}it into another setting (say, in a basket
of various fruits in a dining room for decorative purposes), the apple
does not lose its original identity as an apple, the fruit of a
particular kind of tree, but the apple must now be understood, not in
and of itself but *in relation to the new context* in which it has been
placed.[24](#appen11.html#NFIN714){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN714-1 .apnf}
Hirsch calls this new contextual relationship 'significance'. The new
context does not annihilate the original identity of the apple, but now
the apple must be understood in its relation to its new setting. It is
the same with meaning and its significance: "Meaning" refers to the
whole verbal meaning of a text, and "significance" to textual meaning in
relation to a larger context' beyond itself (i.e., a context of 'another
mind, another era, a wider subject matter, an alien system of values',
etc. (Hirsch 1976:
2--3).[25](#appen11.html#NFIN715){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN715-1 .apnf} What
Hirsch calls 'significance' may be divided into a concept of extended
meaning or merely an application of an original unextended meaning
(e.g., with respect to the latter, how does the message of a particular
ancient biblical text apply to the lives of people living in the
twentieth century?). Our focus here is on 'significance' as the organic
extension of meaning (Hirsch
1967:49--50).[26](#appen11.html#NFIN716){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN716-1
.apnf}

### []{#chap12.html#page_379}'Extended meaning' and its bearing on biblical interpretation in general and the temple in particular {.int_niv2}

The notion of 'extended meaning' is instructive for understanding and
analysing the New Testament's use of the Old. I, along with others,
believe that something like this is what is entailed in Old Testament
literary forms of prophecy or visionary apocalyptic. Old Testament
authors appear to have only dimly, implicitly or partly comprehended the
things of which they were
speaking.[27](#appen11.html#NFIN717){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN717-1 .apnf}

We may say that authorial intentions of Old Testament writers were not
as comprehensive as the simultaneous divine intentions, which become
progressively unpacked as the history of revelation progresses until
they reach climax in Christ. The Old Testament writers prophesied events
to occur not only distant in time from them but in another world, a new
world, which Jesus inaugurated. These writers are comparable in a sense
to people in a spaceship above the earth. They can see only the earth
and its different shading, representing clouds, seas and land masses.
When, however, they see magnified pictures of the earth from satellite
cameras, they are able to make out mountains, rivers, forests, cities,
buildings, houses and people. Both the distant and close-up views are
'literal'. The close-up picture reveals details that someone with a
distant view could never have guessed were there. The close-up even
'looks' like a different reality from the distant. Nevertheless, both
are 'literal' depictions of what is actually there. Similarly, the
literal picture of Old Testament prophecy is magnified by the lens of
New Testament progressive revelation, which enlarges the details of
fulfilment in the beginning new world that will be completed at Christ's
last advent.

With this illustration in mind, our contention is that Christ not only
fulfils all that the Old Testament temple and its prophecies represent,
but that he is the unpacked meaning for which the temple existed all
along.[28](#appen11.html#NFIN718){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN718-1 .apnf} His
establishment of the temple at his first coming is a magnified view of
the new creational temple, and Revelation 21 is the most ultimate highly
magnified picture we will have this side of the consummated new cosmos.
Like the distant and close-up photographs, such a view of the temple
should not be misconceived as diminishing a literal fulfilment of the
Old Testament temple prophecies.

[]{#chap12.html#page_380}We may also compare Israel's temple and
prophecies of another to come to a small balloon with a map of the world
stamped on it (indeed, we have argued that the OT temple was a symbolic
model of the cosmos). The contour lines of the map are hardly
discernible when no air is blown into the balloon. As the balloon begins
to fill with a little air, the details of its map are a bit more
discernible but still too close together to see it clearly. When the
balloon is blown to full size, however, the details are expanded and
become much clearer. The blown-up version is just as 'literal' as the
smaller one, but its details are more understandable. In like manner,
the fulfilment of the temple in the New Testament reveals that, far from
a shrivelling up or fading away of the material temple complex, there is
a material and spiritual expansion that begins with Christ and his
people, and consummates with the entire new heavens and earth! Just as
John the Baptist, the greatest prophet of the Old Testament era, said
that he must decrease but Jesus had to increase (John 3:30), so Jesus
says that with his coming the temple had to decrease and he had to
increase (Matt. 12:6, 'something greater than the temple is here').

We have mentioned that in some cases the Old Testament predicts a
non-material temple. In other cases, however, there *may be* prophecies
describing what would seem to be a structural temple, which we have
argued are fulfilled by an entirely literal, yet non-architectural
temple; that is, Christ and the church fulfil them. To explain this
hermeneutically, we have earlier used the illustration of a father's
promise to a son of a horse and buggy in 1900 being fulfilled faithfully
and on an escalated literal level by a car in 1930. This is, in fact,
also an illustration of biblical typology in which 'Christ fulfils the
Old Testament promises in ways that differ from the actual terms of the
promises' (Goldsworthy 1991: 87). Typology is not mere analogy of
something in the New Testament with something in the Old. Typology
indicates fulfilment of the Old Testament's indirect prophetic
foreshadowing of people, institutions and events in Christ, who is the
ultimate climactic expression of everything God completely intended in
the older revelation -- whether it be the Law, temple and its rituals,
various prophets, priests and kings, and so
on.[29](#appen11.html#NFIN719){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN719-1 .apnf}

A classic example is John 19:36. There John says that Jesus' death on
the cross, without broken bones, was a prophetic 'fulfilment' of the
Passover lamb's sacrifice in Exodus (see Exod. 12:46; Num. 9:12;
Ps. 34:20). Even though the Passover sacrifice was narrated only as a
his[]{#chap12.html#page_381}torical event and not as a formal prophecy
in the Old Testament, in the light of Christ's coming, that event is
seen as foreshadowing the divine Lamb's sacrifice on an escalated scale.
Whether then we speak of going from a horse to a car, or from a
sacrificial animal to the crucified God-man, the hermeneutical
transition from Old to New is often that of going from the 'shadow' to
the 'substance'.

The progress of revelation reveals enlarged meanings of earlier biblical
texts, and later biblical writers further interpret prior canonical
writings in ways that amplify earlier texts. These later interpretations
may formulate meanings of which earlier authors may not have been
conscious, but which do not contravene their original organic intention
but may 'supervene'[30](#appen11.html#NFIN720){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN720-1
.apnf} on it. This is to say that original meanings have
'thick'[31](#appen11.html#NFIN721){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN721-1 .apnf}
content and that original authors likely were not exhaustively aware (in
the way God was) of the full extent of that content. In this regard,
fulfilment often 'fleshes out' prophecy with details of which even the
prophet may not have been fully cognizant.

### Some final thoughts on 'extended meaning' and its bearing on interpretation of the temple {.int_niv2}

The lack of resolution in the discussion of whether some Old Testament
prophecies (like the temple) are literally or non-literally fulfilled is
partly cleared up by proper reflection on the notion of 'already and not
yet' eschatology. The fulfilment of the final resurrection of saints is
a good parallel to the nature of the end-time fulfilment of the temple.
Daniel 12:2, for example, prophesies a resurrection of believers. John
5:25 says, 'an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the
voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live'. The Daniel
prophecy begins fulfilment in the first century, but only on a spiritual
level. People are raised spiritually but not yet physically. Only a few
verses later, however, Jesus refers to the consummate fulfilment
physically of the same Daniel prophecy: 'an hour is coming, in which all
who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; those
who did the good deeds, to a resurrection of life, those who committed
the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment' (John 5:28--29). Both
fulfilments are literal. The 'spiritual' resurrection is just as
'literal' as the physical, since Daniel prophesied the resurrection of
bodies *with resurrected spirits*! The prophecy is not fulfilled all at
once, since first the spiritual resurrection occurs, followed
[]{#chap12.html#page_382}later by the physical. Therefore, it is not the
nature of fulfilment that has changed, but its timing. That is, the
fulfilment of the spiritual and physical resurrections are not
spiritualized nor allegorized but merely staggered.

There is another way in which the Old Testament prophecy of the
resurrection was fulfilled in a twofold manner: Jesus' own resurrection
was the beginning fulfilment ('the first fruits') and the subsequent
physical resurrection of all saints at the end of history is the final
fulfilment (1 Cor. 15:22--23). In light of both John 5 and 1 Corinthians
15, the predicted resurrection is actually fulfilled in three stages:
(1) Christ's physical resurrection; (2) believers' spiritual
resurrection; (3) believers' physical resurrection. Just as prophets
like Daniel surely did not fully understand the staggered nature of the
resurrection, neither did they understand the developmental fulfilment
of the temple.

The fulfilment of the temple (and perhaps other kinds of fulfilment)
follows a similar staggered realization. That is, Christ rises to become
the cornerstone of the temple, and believers are first 'spiritually'
part of the temple through spiritual resurrection, but later an actual
physical part of the temple too at the time of the final physical
resurrection (e.g., Rev. 3:12; 21:1--3), when the entire cosmos becomes
the temple. The basis for comparing the resurrection with the temple
lies in the New Testament's view of Jesus' resurrection body as the
rebuilding of the new temple, so that in him the temple has also begun
physically.[32](#appen11.html#NFIN722){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN722-1 .apnf}
Therefore, the beginning form of the temple is not merely spiritual but
also physical: it is composed of the spirits of saints with the
physically resurrected Christ as its cornerstone.

We have seen that some prophecies of an end-temple foresee a
non-architectural structure, while others are indefinite, merely
referring to the establishment of a future
temple.[33](#appen11.html#NFIN723){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN723-1 .apnf}
These more indefinite prophecies could have been viewed by their
original authors and readers to refer to a structure on the order of the
prior Solomonic and second temples. Yet these contexts speak of the
eschatological temple as being more glorious or greater than the prior
ones (e.g., Is. 62:9; Ezek. 40 -- 48; Zech. 6:12--13; 14:16; Hag.
2:1--9). It is theoretically possible that part of the inaugurated stage
of these prophecies involves an actual larger building complex than ever
before. If so, []{#chap12.html#page_383}that complex, like its Old
Testament predecessors, would be symbolic of the cosmos and of the task
to extend the essence of the temple and spread God's glory throughout
the earth. This was the original purpose of the original Garden temple
and of Israel's subsequent temples. Unlike its predecessors, Christ and
his people associated with this temple would finally accomplish the task
and extend the boundaries of God's holy of holies presence throughout
the earth, the culmination of which is pictured in Revelation 21.
Presumably, on such a reading, the beginning architectural form of the
end-time temple would fade away once its symbolic task has been
accomplished. Whatever precisely happens to it, the whole earth would
finally be considered the consummate, eternal temple in which God's
glory is present everywhere.

A better view, however, of these more indeterminate temple prophecies is
that they are to be interpreted by the more explicit prophecies
predicting an immaterial non-architectural
structure.[34](#appen11.html#NFIN724){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN724-1 .apnf}
Some prophecies understand that the temple was to extend over all of
Jerusalem (Is. 4:5--6; Jer. 3:16--17) or even over all of the land of
Israel (Ezek. 37:26--28; similarly, Lev. 26:10--13). We have seen in the
preceding chapter that even Ezekiel 40 -- 48 is not best interpreted as
a prophecy of the building of an architectural
temple.[35](#appen11.html#NFIN725){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN725-1 .apnf} We
have reached comparable conclusions with respect to Eden as a
non-architectural temple (Gen. 2; Ezek. 28:18), as well as the informal,
small-scale sanctuaries of the patriarchs and the larger-scale one at
Mount Sinai. Even in these cases, while not explicitly prophetic, we
have argued that they contained a pattern in themselves of a temple
expansion that was to pervade the world in fulfilment of the mandate of
Genesis 1:28. We have seen that mandate was interwoven into many of the
more explicitly prophetic texts about the temple, so that they also
imply a sanctuary of universal
dimensions.[36](#appen11.html#NFIN726){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN726-1 .apnf}

[]{#chap12.html#page_384}Another reason these 'indeterminate temple
prophecies' are better viewed as not including any traditional temple
building has to do with the progression of redemptive history. Christ
and his church clearly are the inaugurated form of the latter-day
temple. To have a physical temple built towards the end of the church
age, as a partial inaugurated fulfilment of the same Old Testament
prophecies that Christ and the church had begun to fulfil, would be
hermeneutically and theologically strange. It would be a
redemptive-historical hiccup. Recalling the above summary of Hebrews
enhances the unlikelihood of any future physical temple structure:
physical temples were the 'shadows' and the inaugurated temple in Christ
was the 'true substance' of the shadows. In conjunction with this,
'handmade' temples went out of theological style with the resurrection
of Christ, which commenced the eschatological temple 'made without
hands'. The early Christian community from the beginning reckoned that
any humanly constructed temple was impossible in the eschatological era,
since the old creation is referred to as 'handmade', and the temple of
the new creation is alluded to as 'made without
hands'[37](#appen11.html#NFIN727){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN727-1 .apnf} (as
discussed earlier in this chapter). If this principle were violated,
then redemptive history would take a retrograde step back from the new
creation into the old; the inauguration of the new creation temple in
Christ and the church would exist alongside an old-age temple.
Certainly, when the old world is destroyed at the end of the age, and
only the new, eternal creation remains, there is no room for such an
antiquated structure.

Consequently, an approach of 'literal interpretation' that attempts to
conform fulfilment of prophecies to physical realities as much as
possible is probably not an ideal way to describe a biblical
hermeneutic. Nevertheless, we have endeavoured to show that even someone
guided by such an interpretative rule could see that our understanding
of the end-time temple is not inconsistent with that approach. On the
other hand, a 'literate canonical approach' that aspires to the broad
literary meaning of the entire biblical context is a more felicitous way
to summarize a single method of
interpretation.[38](#appen11.html#NFIN728){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN728-1
.apnf} Such an interpretative approach aims to unravel the original
intention of biblical authors, understanding that intention may be
multi-layered, []{#chap12.html#page_385}without any of the layers
contradicting the others. These original intentions may have meaning
more correspondent to 'literal' physical reality, while others may
allude to 'literal' spiritual realities. This is certainly true with
respect to the temple. We have attempted to sail between the coast of
'literalism' on one side and that of 'spiritualization' on the other,
and hope we have avoided the dangers of both.

We think that the approach we have taken avoids the criticism of
mystical spiritualizing, since the end-time temple is physical but on a
grander scale than former temples. Indeed, the entire new creation is
what the localized temple pointed to and symbolized all along! Rather
than a little structure, the new cosmos is the physical abode for the
divine glory. This approach does not employ allegorical methods of
interpretation or the reading in of symbols that have no controls.
Rather, the controlling paradigm throughout this study has been Genesis
1:28 in relation to the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2. We have seen that
later temples and prophecies of the end-time temple usually allude to
one or both of these Genesis passages, so that these early Genesis texts
provide the interpretative controls for understanding the progressive
revelation of the temple in the Old and New Testaments. On the other
hand, this ongoing biblical revelation itself sheds light on how these
Genesis passages are developed, though this interpretative developmental
growth cannot extend beyond the organic bounds of the first chapters of
the Bible.[39](#appen11.html#NFIN729){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN729-1 .apnf}
In fact, the image of God's glorious presence in a garden-like temple
has formed an inclusio or kind of 'book-end' structure around the entire
canon (Gen. 2 and Rev. 21:1 -- 22:3), providing an interpretative key
for understanding the material about the temple throughout Scripture.
Another interpretative key has been the temple's cosmic symbolism, which
pointed to the goal of its own extension to become co-equal with the
cosmos itself.

## Theological reflections on the relationship of the Old Testament temple to the temple in the New Testament {.int_niv1}

The primary words translated as 'temple' or 'sanctuary' in the New
Testament are *hieron* (72 times) and *naos* (45 times), while 'house'
(*oikos*, approximately 12 times), 'holy place' (*hagios*, approximately
11 times) and 'tabernacle' (*skēnē*, approximately 14 times) also occur.
[]{#chap12.html#page_386}All of these words can refer either to Israel's
old tabernacle or temple structure in the Greek Old Testament (either to
the holy of holies or the whole temple complex). In the New Testament,
they refer either to the old tabernacle or temple *or*, with the
exception of *hieron*, to the new temple inaugurated in Christ and the
Spirit and those identified with Christ through the
Spirit.[40](#appen11.html#NFIN730){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN730-1 .apnf}

Interestingly, *hieron* refers only to the old temple and never to the
new temple in the New Testament. It occurs in this sense only in the
Gospels, Acts and Paul. Perhaps the reason for this is mere stylistic
preference, though there may be more behind the choice than at first
meets the eye. The other words proliferate in the canonical Greek Old
Testament with reference to Israel's temple, but *hieron* occurs only
rarely with this
sense.[41](#appen11.html#NFIN731){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN731-1 .apnf}
Furthermore, *hieron* virtually never refers there to God's heavenly
temple,[42](#appen11.html#NFIN732){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN732-1 .apnf}
whereas the other words refer to it several times
each.[43](#appen11.html#NFIN733){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN733-1 .apnf} It is
possible that the reason the other words are used for the new temple is
that they may have been deemed more suitable to refer to such a new
temple because they had already referred to the heavenly temple in the
Old Testament. The usage may have underscored continuity between God's
prior holy dwelling in heaven and the beginning descent of that dwelling
to earth in the form of Christ and the Spirit.

Regardless of whether or not the usage of these Greek words hints at
this theological relationship, it is instructive to enquire about the
relationship between the heavenly temple of the Old Testament age
[]{#chap12.html#page_387}and the eschatological temple in heaven in the
new age. Could it be that with the ascension of Christ and the giving of
the Spirit a new redemptive-historical stage or instalment of the
heavenly temple has developed? Comparing the developmental nature of the
kingdom of God in the two testaments may be helpful in understanding the
connection of the temple. God had always reigned as King, and with
Christ's resurrection a new stage was reached in that now God rules
through the Last Adam. God's kingdom has finally spread beyond Israel's
geographical borders. Likewise, the new latter-day temple of Christ
developed God's Old Testament heavenly temple. The incarnate Christ was
God's presence descending to the earth from heaven in a way as never
before. Christ's resurrection was an even greater expression of this
end-time temple that descended to earth to a greater degree than
previously. After Christ, who is the expression of the true temple
ascended to heaven, the heavenly temple again began to descend in the
form of the Spirit and expanded by growing through incorporating people
into it. The expansion is consummated at the end of the age by the
heavenly temple fully covering the entire earth, as we have discussed at
the beginning of this chapter with respect to Revelation 21.

Thus, the first primary difference between the heavenly temple of the
former era and that of the new is that Christ, the Last Adam, has been
exalted to sit at God's right hand in the heavenly temple-palace. The
latter-day goal all along of the heavenly temple was that it descend to
earth and permeate every part of it. That did not happen during the
epoch of Israel because of the nation's disobedience. Until the time of
Christ, God's special revelatory presence extended only to the borders
of the holy of holies. Then Christ came and did what Adam should have
done, and in so doing he began to expand the temple even during his
earthly ministry. When he ascended into the heavenly temple, he then
sent his Spirit to create God's people as a part of that extending
heavenly temple. But since the church represents only a remnant of the
earth's inhabitants who accept the gospel, God's unique presence does
not spread throughout the world, so that the universal extent of the
temple has not yet been achieved, and will not during this age. Only
when Jesus Christ returns a final time will he destroy the old cosmos
and create a new one, wherein God's presence will dwell completely.

Therefore, while the latter-day temple of God's presence in Christ and
the Spirit has irrupted into space-time history, it has not done so as
completely as it will at the very end of history. In other words, the
end-time temple has begun fulfilment among God's people
[]{#chap12.html#page_388}through Christ and the Spirit, but that
fulfilment has not been completed. This means saints imperfectly
experience the 'holy of holies' presence of God in this age, but will
experience his presence fully in the coming epoch of the consummated new
creation (Rev. 22:4--5).

In this connection, there is another instructive, though difficult,
question to pose: what is the relationship of God's presence in the holy
of holies of Israel's temple to his presence in the new temple? While it
was true that God's presence filled the entire creation in the time
before Christ (i.e., God was omnipresent), his presence was more
immanent in the holy of holies than anywhere else on earth. We may call
this his special revelatory presence, which extended from his heavenly
throne down to the inner sanctum. This reality is pictured as God
sitting on his heavenly throne with his 'feet' resting on the sacred
'footstool' of the ark of the covenant. Anyone, except the high priest,
who would enter this inner room would die because of this holy presence.
Even the high priest could not look directly on the divine glory, but
had to offer incense, which clouded and shielded him from gazing
directly at God.

God moved out of the holy of holies at the inception of the Babylonian
exile (Ezek. 10:18; 11:22--23), and probably did not return to dwell in
the second temple that was rebuilt after the return from Babylon. That
unique presence returned to the heavenly sanctuary until the coming of
Christ, when it returned to earth again, not to dwell in another
handmade temple but in one made without hands: 'the Word became flesh
and tabernacled among us, and we beheld his glory' (John 1:14). God's
presence in the heavenly temple extended to earth, no longer into the
old holy of holies but in Christ (John 1:51). After his resurrection and
ascension, God's tabernacling presence descended in the form of the
Spirit, making those identified with Christ into part of the temple. The
Father and Son, however, still reside in the heavenly temple and not on
earth. Therefore, the temple's centre of gravity during the church age
is located in the heavenly realm, but it has begun to invade the earthly
through the Spirit in the church. This is why the book of Revelation
usually portrays the 'temple' (*naos*) in heaven (11 of 15
times),[44](#appen11.html#NFIN734){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN734-1 .apnf}
though related to believers []{#chap12.html#page_389}on earth (e.g.
1:13; 11:1--4) through their identification with the Spirit
existentially (cf. Rev. 1:4 and 4:5 with 1:13; 2:2; 11:4) and with
Christ (cf. 3:12 with 21:22) and their representative angels
positionally (cf. 1:13 and 1:16;
2:1).[45](#appen11.html#NFIN735){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN735-1 .apnf}

Though the three parts of Israel's old temple no longer exist, until the
end of the age there may be a sense in which there are still three
dimensions of the new temple. First, the holy of holies remains in
heaven, the place of the temple's 'centre of gravity'. Second, the holy
place is the spiritual dimension that extends to earth, where God's
people function as a 'kingdom of priests' (Rev. 1:6; 5:10; cf. Exod.
19:6) and as 'lampstands' shining God's revelation to the world
(Rev. 1:13, 20; 2:2; 11:1, 4). The Spirit is the lamp on these
lampstands that enables the church to shine (cf. Rev. 1:4 with 4:6).
Third, the 'outer court' represents the church's physical existence
(Rev. 11:1--2), especially in its suffering, which is a part of the old
earth.[46](#appen11.html#NFIN736){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN736-1 .apnf} Just
as the outer courtyard was the place where animals were slain to be
sacrificed, so believers sacrifice themselves in their willingness to
suffer for their faith (cf. Rev. 6:9--11;
Heb. 13:10--13).[47](#appen11.html#NFIN737){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN737-1
.apnf} As in the old temple, so in the new inaugurated one there is an
increasing gradation in holiness beginning in the outer court and
proceeding through the holy place into the holy of holies.

Priests in the old epoch had to be ritually clean in order to enter and
minister in the holy place. If they tried to minister while unclean,
they would be put to death. Believer priests minister in the spiritual
'holy place' even though they are unclean due to sin. Though believers
are certainly existentially imperfect, they are not destroyed because of
their 'blamelessness' in God's sight due to their corporate
identification with Christ, the perfect Last Adam and great high priest,
who represents them in two ways. First, he suffered the penalty of their
sin through death on their behalf so that they are declared not guilty.
Second, his righteousness vicariously becomes theirs. He has 'once for
all' performed the priestly task that had originally been given to the
first Adam.

Therefore, believers still do not yet *personally* enter into the
heavenly holy of holies, but do so through their representative high
priest, []{#chap12.html#page_390}Jesus Christ. He has entered in on
their behalf (just as Israel's high priest entered in as a
representative of the rest of the nation, and as a typological
foreshadowing of Christ). There he 'obtained eternal redemption'
(Heb. 9:11--12, 24--28; cf. 3:17). On the basis of Christ's priestly
work of entering that heavenly sanctuary, believers 'have confidence'
that they will 'enter the \[most\] holy place' themselves in the future
(Heb. 10:19--21).[48](#appen11.html#NFIN738){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN738-1
.apnf} Believers have a 'hope' that 'enters within the veil, where Jesus
has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest'
(Heb. 6:19--20).[49](#appen11.html#NFIN739){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN739-1
.apnf}

The temple curtain tore at Christ's death, and at his resurrection 'he
entered through the veil' of the heavenly temple (Heb. 10:20). The
removing of the veil of the heavenly temple will occur for believers
when the church (the body of Christ) suffers death and resurrection at
the end of the age, according to the principle that the church 'follows
the Lamb wherever he goes' (Rev. 14:4). It is natural, therefore, that
after Revelation 11:1--18 portrays the church's suffering, demise and
vindication according to the model of Christ's career (on which see
Beale 1999a: 567--568), 'the sanctuary \[holy of holies\] of God was
opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant \[symbolic of the divine
presence\] in His sanctuary appeared' (Rev. 11:19; so similarly,
Rev. 21:1 -- 22:5). Perhaps this is what Isaiah 25:7--8a refers to: 'And
on this mountain He will swallow up the face of the covering which is
over all peoples, even the veil which is stretched over all nations. He
will swallow up death for all
time.'[50](#appen11.html#NFIN740){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN740-1 .apnf}

J. W. Mealy argues that this Isaiah passage is alluded to in
Revelation 21:1 and 4 (the latter of which clearly alludes to Is. 25:8),
where respectively 'there is no longer a sea' in the new creation nor
any 'death' or sadness:

::: cita
[]{#chap12.html#page_391}Revelation 21.3--4, which says that the
tabernacle of God has come to be among his people, must be understood in
the context of its background in Revelation. Earlier in the text \[of
Revelation\], heaven has been pictured as the present tabernacle of
God's abode, and the expanse of the sky has been treated as
corresponding sometimes . . . to the veil that separated the holy of
holies from the rest of the sanctuary, hiding the ark of God from human
sight. Thus the parousia was described in terms of the parting or
removal of that veil (6.14; 11:19), so that God's throne could be seen.
Hand in hand with this conception . . . went 21.3--4, which posited the
establishment of a new sanctuary on earth, which has no such separating
veil -- God's people will corporately dwell in his immediate presence .
. . His presence will never again be hidden behind the separating veil
of the sky, for in the new heaven and the new earth 'there is no longer
any sea'.[51](#appen11.html#NFIN741){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN741-1 .apnf}
:::

We think that, though this identification of the 'sea' may not be
persuasive, Mealy's general line of thought is valid. Until that final
day of unveiling, God's people 'draw near' to the heavenly holy of
holies, which, we have argued, means they have begun to enter the outer
court and holy place of the celestial temple (Heb. 10:22). They have
*begun* to 'come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem . . .' (Heb. 12:22), which were seen earlier to be
equivalent concepts to the eternal
temple.[52](#appen11.html#NFIN742){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN742-1 .apnf} That
the believers' 'coming to Mount Zion and to the \[heavenly\] city' is an
inaugurated but not consummated reality is apparent from Hebrews 12:28
('since we receive a kingdom that cannot be
shaken')[53](#appen11.html#NFIN743){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN743-1 .apnf} and
13:14 ('for here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the
city which is to come').

During this present era, therefore, there still must be three sections
even of the inaugurated latter-day temple because its purpose and
fulfilment will not be completed until the destruction of the old order
and establishment of the new. The consummate form of the new temple will
appear at the end of time in the new creation, when the heavenly
dimension fully breaks in and replaces the old earth, which has been
[]{#chap12.html#page_392}destroyed
(Rev. 21:1--3).[54](#appen11.html#NFIN744){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN744-1
.apnf} At this time there will be only one section of the temple: the
holy of holies, the dimensions of which will cover the whole cosmos.
Heaven will come down and not only perfectly fill the souls of God's
people, but it will fill every part of the new creation because it will
be the new creation. Then there will no longer be a need for the
church's function as a lampstand, since their role of witnessing to
God's light will be finished. They will no longer need to shine God's
light in a dark world, since that world will be gone; instead, in the
new creation, 'the glory of God' will have 'illumined it, and its lamp
\[will be\] the Lamb' (21:23; so also 22:5). The shining function will
have shifted to God and the Lamb, and the saints merely will be
reflectors of that glorious light.

## Conclusion {.int_niv1}

In view of the discussion so far in this book, we conclude that God
created the cosmos to be his great temple, in which he rested after his
creative work. His special revelatory presence, nevertheless, did not
yet fill the entire earth because his human vice-regent was to achieve
this purpose. God had installed this vice-regent in the garden sanctuary
to extend the boundaries of God's presence there worldwide. Adam
disobeyed this mandate, so that humanity no longer enjoyed God's
presence in the small Garden. As a result, all humanity and all creation
became contaminated with sin. Therefore, in view of the storyline of the
Bible, the assertions about God's inability to exist in any building on
earth include allusion to the old earth and temple not being an adequate
abode for him because of being polluted with sin and the need for
purification and restoration before God's Shekinah presence, limited to
heaven and the holy of holies, could dwell everywhere throughout the
cosmos. All human attempts to extend God's presence throughout a sinful
earth met with, at best, limited success. The successful fulfilment of
the Adamic commission awaited the presence -- and obedience -- of the
last Adam, Jesus Christ.

Thus, the redemptive-historical development may be explained as
proceeding from God's unique presence in the structural temple in the
[]{#chap12.html#page_393}Old Testament to the God-man, Christ, the true
temple. As a result of Christ's resurrection, the Spirit continued
building the end-time temple, the building materials of which are God's
people, thus extending the temple into the new creation in the new age.
This building process will culminate in the eternal new heavens and
earth as a paradisal city-temple. Or, more briefly, the temple of God
has been transformed into God, his people and the rest of the new
creation as the
temple.[55](#appen11.html#NFIN745){#chap12.html#ap_NFIN745-1

# Practical reflections on Eden and the temple for the church in the twenty-first century {.chap_tit}

::: dev
How does the vision of the worldwide temple in Revelation 21 -- 22
relate to Christians and their role in fulfilling the mission of the
church? We, as God's people, have already begun to be God's endtime
temple where his presence is manifested to the world, and we are to
extend the boundaries of the new garden-temple until Christ returns,
when, finally, they will be expanded worldwide.

This is just what Ephesians 2:20--22 asserts: the church has 'been built
upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself
being the cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together
is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you are also being
built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit'. The church is
growing and expanding in Christ throughout the present age (cf. also
Eph. 4:13--16) in order that God's saving presence and 'the manifold
wisdom of God might now be made known' even 'in the heavenly places'
(Eph. 3:10). Likewise, quite comparably to Ephesians, after referring to
Christ as a 'living stone' (1 Pet. 2:4), Peter alludes to Christians as
'living stones . . . being built up as a spiritual house for a holy
priesthood' (1 Pet. 2:5) in order to 'proclaim the excellencies' of God
(1 Pet. 2:9). In both Ephesians and 1 Peter the church is an expanding,
living temple of witness to God's saving
presence.[1](#appen11.html#NFIN746){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN746-1 .apnf}

How do we first experience God's presence? By believing in Christ: that
he died for our sin, he rose from the dead, and reigns as the Lord God.
Then God's Spirit comes into us and dwells in us, in a similar manner as
God dwelt in the temple of Eden and Israel's temple.

How do we increase the presence of God in our lives and our churches?
How did Adam maintain God's presence in his life before
[]{#chap13.html#page_396}the fall? Certainly, remembering, believing and
obeying God's word was crucial to a healthy relationship with
God.[2](#appen11.html#NFIN747){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN747-1 .apnf} Remember
that after God put him into the Garden in Genesis 2:15 'for serving
\[cultivating\] and guarding', he gave Adam a threefold statement to
remember by which he would be helped to 'serve and guard' the
Garden-temple: in Genesis 2:16--17, God says, 'From any tree of the
garden (1) you may eat freely; but (2) from the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil you shall not eat, (3) for in the day that you eat from it
you shall surely die.' When confronted by the satanic serpent, Eve
either failed to remember God's word accurately or intentionally changed
it for her own purposes. First, she minimized their privileges by saying
merely 'we may eat', whereas God had said 'you may eat *freely*'.
Second, Eve minimized the judgment by saying, 'lest you die', whereas
God said, 'you shall *surely* die'. Third, she maximized the prohibition
by affirming, 'you shall not . . . touch it', becoming the first
legalist in history (for God had originally said only that they 'shall
not eat . . . it').[3](#appen11.html#NFIN748){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN748-1
.apnf} Adam and Eve did not remember God's word, and they 'fell', and
they failed to extend the boundaries of God's Edenic temple.

Jesus Christ, the Last Adam and true Israel, however, knew the word and,
by obeying it, established himself as God's temple. Remember when the
devil tried to tempt Christ, in Matthew 4? With each temptation Jesus
responded to Satan by quoting from the Old Testament, from passages in
Deuteronomy where Moses rebuked Israel for failing in their task. Christ
succeeded in just those temptations where Adam and Israel failed because
he remembered God's word and obeyed it. Therefore, Christ is the last
Adam and true Israel who rules by his word as King over evil in the way
Adam and corporate Adam, Israel, should have ruled.

Do we come by faith to God's word daily, as did Jesus, in order that we
may be strengthened increasingly with God's presence in order to fulfil
our task of spreading that presence to others who don't know Christ?
Believers express their identification with Christ's Adamic
[]{#chap13.html#page_397}kingship when they spread the presence of God
by living for Christ and speaking his word and unbelievers accept it,
and Satan's victorious hold on their heart is broken.

In addition to knowing and obeying God's word, Solomon's dedication of
his temple underscores prayer as a crucial function in relation to the
temple (1 Kgs. 8:23--53). Solomon repeatedly makes the point that, in
response to various circumstances, Israel was to 'pray toward this place
\[the temple\]', and he petitions God 'hear Thou in heaven, Thy dwelling
place; hear and forgive' (1 Kgs. 8:30; so likewise 8:38--39, 42--43). In
fact, the mention of 'prayer' or 'supplication' recurs constantly
throughout the narrative (vv. 28, 29, 30, 33, 35, 38, 42, 44, 47, 48,
49, 52).[4](#appen11.html#NFIN749){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN749-1 .apnf} The
reason prayers were to be directed specifically to the earthly temple
and not directly to God in heaven was because, as we have often seen
throughout the present study, God's presence in the heavenly temple
extended to the holy of holies. This is what Solomon appeals to when he
recalls that God had said, '"My name shall be there," to listen to the
prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place' (1 Kgs. 8:29; so
also 1 Maccabees 7:37). God's name represented his character and his
presence. Thus, not merely were priests to offer up prayers in the
temple precincts but certainly all Israelites, whether in the temple's
outer court or elsewhere in the land or in territories outside Israel in
exile, were to pray towards the earthly temple, where God's presence
dwelt.

This role of prayer is enhanced for Christians who now are identified
with Jesus through the Spirit as part of the end-time temple. From one
perspective, all believers are priests and they function as priests by
offering up prayers in the sphere of the spiritual temple. But saints
are also true Israelites who are in exile because they still exist in
the exile of this old, fallen world. At the end, this old world will be
destroyed, and a new world will be created in which God's people will be
resurrected, completely restored to God, and consummately delivered from
exile. They will take their place as the crown of the eschatological
creation in Christ, the Last Adam. They will all be high priests,
dwelling eternally in the new creational holy of holies and in the midst
of God's full latter-day presence. Until then, however, we pray as new
covenant priests in the New Testament equivalent of the holy place,
which is a spiritual sphere of our ministry and witness as a lampstand
in the world. We also pray as exiled new Israelites, as we
[]{#chap13.html#page_398}live as pilgrims on the old, fallen earth. In
both cases, our prayer is directed towards God in his heavenly holy of
holies, until it descends to fill and encompass the new earth. Prayer as
an activity inextricably linked to the temple is what is behind Jesus'
words in Matthew
18:19--20:[5](#appen11.html#NFIN750){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN750-1 .apnf}
'Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything
that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in
heaven. For where two or three have gathered together in My name, there
I am in their midst.'

Isaiah 56:7 says that the latter-day temple 'will be called a house of
prayer for all the peoples'. Jesus rejects Israel's temple because it
was not performing that role and because Jews believed the temple
signified only their election from among all the nations of the earth
(on which see the earlier discussion in ch. 5 of Matt. 21:13; Mark
11:17; Luke 19:46). Those who are a part of the temple today will
demonstrate their participation in it by being continually
prayerful.[6](#appen11.html#NFIN751){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN751-1 .apnf} If
in the Old Testament prayer was considered 'like incense' and 'like an
evening grain offering' (Ps. 141:2; cf. also
Ps. 119:108),[7](#appen11.html#NFIN752){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN752-1 .apnf}
how much more is that the case in the new age.

In summary, all Christians are now spiritual Levitical priests (in
fulfilment of Is. 66:21). Our ongoing task is to serve God in his temple
in which we always dwell and of which we are a part. Our continual
priestly tasks are what the first Adam's were to be: to keep the order
and peace of the spiritual sanctuary by learning and teaching God's
word, by praying always, and by being vigilant in keeping out unclean
moral and spiritual
things.[8](#appen11.html#NFIN753){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN753-1 .apnf} We
also continually offer sacrifices in order to keep the order of the
spiritual temple's liturgy. The prayers of saints are now the 'incense'
offerings given to God (Rev. 5:8; 8:3--5) that replace the old incense
offerings made at the altar of burnt offering and the altar of incense
in the holy place (e.g., 1 Chr. 6:49). As we saw above, already in
Israel there was a sense in which 'prayer' was 'counted as incense
before' God (Ps. 141:2). The Old Testament anticipated a time when
incense offerings would be made to God 'in every place' (Mal. 1:11).

The essential sacrifice we offer is our own body, which is 'a living and
holy sacrifice, well-pleasing to God', which is our 'spiritual
[]{#chap13.html#page_399}service of worship' (Rom. 12:1). In so doing,
we follow our Saviour's example, who 'gave Himself up for us, an
offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma' (Eph. 5:2). As
Jesus, when we are loyal to our covenantal relationship to God and
suffer for our faith, we are offering ourselves as a sacrifice on an
altar to God.[9](#appen11.html#NFIN754){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN754-1 .apnf}
Hosea 6:6--7 says, 'I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, and in
the knowledge of God rather than burnt
offerings.[10](#appen11.html#NFIN755){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN755-1 .apnf}
But like Adam[11](#appen11.html#NFIN756){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN756-1
.apnf} they have transgressed the covenant.' Possibly, pre-fall humanity
was to offer such spiritual sacrifices, and Israel's offering of animal
sacrifices in a post-fall world indicated not only their willingness to
give themselves wholeheartedly to God but foreshadowed the return to
spiritual sacrifices only, in the future
Eden.[12](#appen11.html#NFIN757){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN757-1 .apnf} We
even offer a well-pleasing sacrifice when we confess our sins and so
humble ourselves before God: 'The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit;/A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise'
(Ps. 51:17).[13](#appen11.html#NFIN758){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN758-1 .apnf}

The nature of our sacrifices as obedient Adamic-like priests is vitally
linked to the idea of expanding the sacred sphere of God's presence in
order that others would experience it and come into the sacred temple
themselves. Believers are priests in that they serve as mediators
between God and the unbelieving world. When unbelievers accept the
church's mediating witness, they not only come into God's presence, but
they begin to participate themselves as mediating priests who witness.
As priests, we should make sure that we ourselves are growing in the
experience of the divine presence. When we do not compromise our faith
and relationship in God's presence and, consequently, suffer for our
unswerving commitment, we are []{#chap13.html#page_400}sacrificing
ourselves. It is this very sacrifice that God has designed in the new
temple to be the means to move unbelievers to believe the church's
testimony and to begin to experience God's presence themselves. The 'two
witnesses' in Revelation 11 offer themselves as sacrifices by suffering
for their faith *as they go throughout the world* and are rejected
because of their testimony to Christ.

This is why whenever Paul speaks of being a sacrifice, without exception
he is referring to his ministry of furthering his witness to unbelieving
Gentiles. For example, Paul says he is 'a minister of Christ Jesus to
the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, in order that
my offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable' to God (Rom.
15:16). Paul and his fellow-workers are a sacrifice of a 'sweet aroma'
and 'fragrance . . . leading to God among those who are being saved',
resulting in 'life'. That 'aroma' is none other ultimately than the
glorious presence of God that Moses had experienced in the tabernacle
(see 2 Cor. 3:12--18)! That divine presence is seen clearly in, among
other things, the midst of suffering for the faith and not compromising
(e.g., 2 Cor. 4:7--18; 12:9--10). No doubt, believers who have followed
Paul's priestly lead have played their part in contributing to the
church's effective mission throughout the ages, which is characterized
by the saying 'the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church'.

Furthermore, the church's support of others to go out and spread the
gospel is also considered a 'sacrifice'. Paul said that the Philippians'
financial support given to him during his 'first preaching of the
gospel' in Thessalonica was 'a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice,
wellpleasing to God' (Phil. 4:15--18). Even Paul's ministry of building
up other believers in the faith, he believed, was 'pouring out' a 'drink
offering on the sacrifice and service of ' their faith (Phil. 2:17; so
also 2 Tim. 4:6). He says elsewhere that persevering faithfulness in
ministry for the upbuilding of the faith of others was tantamount to
building up the temple on the foundation of Christ (1 Cor. 3:5--17).

Thus, extending the boundaries of the temple by witnessing and
strengthening those receiving the witness is a priestly sacrifice and
offering to God. God's presence grows among his priestly people by their
knowing his word, believing it and by obeying it, and then they spread
that presence to others by living their lives faithfully and prayerfully
in the world. For example, a persevering and joyous faith in the midst
of trial is an amazing priestly witness to the unbelieving world. It
gets the world's attention. Such a witness either sparks more
persecution or it influences some who persecute to join the church. This
is what 'missions' is all about.

[]{#chap13.html#page_401}One summer my wife and I bought a 'Rose of
Sharon' bush and planted it on the north side of our house. The bush was
supposed to grow to about six feet high and four feet wide and bear
flowers. After a few months, however, we noticed that our bush was not
growing at all, though it had began to produce buds. The buds, however,
never opened into full flowers. The problem was that our bush was not
getting enough sunlight. If we did not transplant it, the bush would not
grow to its normal size and it would not produce any flowers. Likewise,
we as the church will not bear fruit and grow and extend across the
earth in the way God intends unless we stay out of the shadows of the
world and remain in the light of God's presence -- in his word and
prayer and in fellowship with other believers in the church, the temple
of God. The mark of the true church is an expanding witness to the
presence of God: first to our families, then to others in the church,
then to our neighbourhood, then to our city, then the country and
ultimately the whole earth.

May God give us grace to go out into the world as his extending temple
and spread God's presence by reflecting it until it finally fills the
entire earth, as it will according to Revelation 21 -- 22.
Jeremiah 3:16--17 says that in the end-time, people 'will no longer say
"the ark of the . . . L[ORD]{.small} \[in Israel's old temple\]." And it
shall not come to mind, nor shall they remember it,' because the
end-time temple that will encompass the new creation will be
incomparable to the old temple.

I have heard it said that if you catch a small shark, it will stay a
size proportionate to the aquarium that you put it in. Sharks can be
six inches long yet fully matured at that size. But if you turn them
loose in the ocean, they grow to their normal length of eight feet. We
as individual Christians, as members of a local church and as part of
Christ's church throughout the world must not merely share our lives and
God's word with one another, but we need to get out of our own little
fishbowls and manifest the presence of Christ through our words and
lives, so that the boundaries of the temple, the church, will grow until
the whole earth is encompassed with and manifests the presence of
God.[14](#appen11.html#NFIN759){#chap13.html#ap_NFIN759-1 .apnf} Through
us God will fulfil his promise in Habakkuk 2:14, 'For the earth will be
filled/With the knowledge of the glory of the L[ORD]{.small},/As the
waters cover the sea.' The mark of the true church is always to be
outward-looking and expanding God's presence and not obsessively
introspective.

[]{#chap13.html#page_402}The main point of this book is that *our task
as the covenant community, the church is to be God's temple, so filled
with his glorious presence that we expand and fill the earth with that
presence until God finally accomplishes the goal completely at the end
of time*! This is our common mission. May the church of the twenty-first
century unite in order to attain this goal. Then, may the church, the
true Israel and true temple, experience the priestly blessing pronounced
on Israel from the tabernacle, as it extends God's tabernacling
presence:

Ps. 78:69 has a striking parallel in the *Enuma Elish* 6.112, where it
is said concerning the building of Marduk's temple, 'A likeness of what
he made (?) in heaven \[let him make (?)\] on earth' (the translation of
the *Enuma Elish* follows Heidel 1942: 50. Cf. also the translation of
Foster 1997: 402: 'He shall make on earth the counterpart of what he
brought to pass in heaven.' Jer. 17:12 is another text possibly parallel
to Ps. 78:69: 'A glorious throne on high from the beginning is the place
of our sanctuary.' There is debate about whether the whole verse refers
only to a heavenly temple or only an earthly temple. Is it not possible
that both are in mind as in the psalm? If so, God's glorious throne in
his heavenly temple is being compared to the earthly temple that was to
reflect the former.

The equivalence was also made by early Judaism (so *Wisdom of Solomon*
9:8: the temple was 'an imitation of the holy tabernacle which you
prepared from the beginning'); see Haran 1978: 189--204 on the organic
correspondences between the tabernacle and temple; cf. also Clifford
1984: 112--115. For the close link between the tabernacle and the
temple, see 1 Kgs. 8:1--6 (= 2 Chr. 5:2--5), which may imply that the
tabernacle was even incorporated into the temple (on which cf. Cross
1977: 175).

See further Levenson 1988: 92--93. Translations of Ezek. 43:14 typically
have 'from the base on the ground' but literally it is 'from the bosom
of the earth \[or ground\]'; among the reasons for associating 'the
altar hearth' (literally 'Ariel') of Ezek. 43:16 with 'the mountain of
God' is Levenson's observation that the same mysterious word 'Ariel'
occurs also in Is. 29:1, where it refers to 'the city where David
camped' and is equated by synonymous parallelism to 'Mount Zion' (cf.
Is. 29:7a with 29:8h), so that it resonates with 'mountain' imagery (on
the ambivalent meaning of the Hebrew word, see further BDB, 72). See
also Barrois 1980: 65--66, who renders the respective phrases in Ezek.
43:14, 16, as 'bosom of the earth' and 'the mountain of God', which he
sees to be symbolic cosmic names. For virtually identical conclusions,
see Mitchell 1980: 36, who observes that Ezekiel's altar resembled a
Babylonian ziggurat, which, as we will see later, was designed to
resemble a mountain and was considered the top of a temple.

The altar's association with the earth may be enhanced by noticing that
it is repeatedly described as having a 'foundation' (Exod. 29:12; Lev.
4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34), imagery typical elsewhere of structures rooted to
the earth (e.g., Ezek. 30:4; Mic. 1:6; Ps. 137:7; Job 4:19; Lam. 4:11)
and sometimes used of mountains (Deut. 32:22; Ps. 18:7). I am indebted
to G. P. Hugenberger for these observations.

See also Bloch-Smith 1994: 26--27, on Solomon's 'bronze sea' as
representing the primordial sea or waters of Eden, though some see it
representing the primeval chaos waters that were overcome at creation.
Cf. Bloch-Smith (1994: 20--21) and C. Meyers (1992a: 1060--1061), who
note both connotations of the 'sea', and underscore its symbolic
significance, the latter especially pointing out that Solomon's 'bronze
sea' was over seven feet high and fifteen feet in diameter, holding
about 10,000 gallons of water and weighing between 25 and 30 tons when
empty. Priests would have had to climb a ladder to wash in it.

So Walton 2001: 148. Among the three other uses elsewhere in the OT, two
also refer to the 'lights' of the heaven. The only other use is Ps. 90:8
('the light of your presence'), which may suggest that the lampstand
'lights' also symbolized the light of God's glorious presence, just as
the stars were held to reflect God's glory (Pss. 19:1; 148:3--4; cf.
Pss. 8:1; 50:6; 57:5). Such an identification may be represented in the
Qumran *Hymn Scroll* (1QH 7.24): 'I \[the Teacher of Righteousness\]
will shine with a *seven-fold li*\[*ght*\] in the *E*\[*den* which\]
Thou has \[m\]ade for Thy glory' (for justification of the translation
'Eden', see below at the end of this chapter).

The only other usage is in Ps. 49:14, which refers to earth as an
'elevated place' above Sheol; in Qumran the word occurs four times, all
pertaining to God's heavenly dwelling. The cloud in 1 Kgs. 8:12 is
likely mixed with brightness and darkness, apparently like a dark
thunder cloud containing lightning (like that on Sinai, e.g., Exod.
19:16; 20:18--21). In this respect, 1 Kgs. 8:53b ([LXX]{.small}) adds to
the Hebrew text the following, evidently as an interpretative expansion
of 1 Kgs. 8:12--13: 'Then spoke Solomon concerning the house, when he
had finished building it -- He \[God\] manifested the sun in the heaven;
the Lord said he would dwell in darkness; build thou my house, a
beautiful house for thyself to dwell in anew.'

The Jews living in Qumran went so far as to believe that the heavenly

place = *ze˘bul*\] shine out, when they retire to the abode of glory; at
the entry of the constellation in the days of the new moon . . . it is a
great day for the Holy of Holies' (1QS 10.2--4 \[Martínez 1994\]). This
Qumran passage may have been inspired by Ps. 19:4--5.

More overtly, Josephus (*Ant.* 3.183) says the 'blue' of the

Cf. 'sapphire' as a part of the heavenly temple (Exod. 24:10; Ezek.
1:26; 10:1; Rev. 21:19), likely included in the earthly temple (1 Chr.
29:2), and a facet of the priest's clothing (Exod. 28:18; 39:11); cf.
onyx as a part of the priestly clothing (Exod. 25:7; 28:9, 20; 35:9, 27;
39:6, 13) and of the temple (1 Chr. 29:2), though not mentioned
explicitly in the heavenly visions; cf. 'jasper' as a part of the
priest's attire (Exod. 28:20; 39:13) and of the appearance of the
heavenly temple (Rev. 4:3; 21:11, 18--19), the latter of which also
suggests that 'jasper' (or a stone essentially identical to it) was
included among the precious stones of Solomon's temple; cf. 'beryl' as
part of the priestly apparel (Exod. 28:20; 39:13) and of the structure
of the heavenly temple (Ezek. 1:16; Rev. 21:20; cf. Dan. 10:6), which
shows again that it was presumably included among the 'precious stones'
of Solomon's temple.

In this context, the wealth and valuable metals ultimately find their
fulfilment in more than physical metallic reality in a glorious new
creation, whereby the ultimate wealth they bring is themselves as
worshippers and reflectors of God's end-time glorious presence (on
which, see Beale 1999a: 1093--1101, for how Is. 60:3, 5, 11, 19 is
fulfilled in the new cosmos). The word 'beauty' is also contextually
associated with astronomical phenomena in Is. 62:1, 3 ('brightness . . .
a torch that is burning') and Ps. 110:3 ('Thy people will volunteer . .
. in the *beauty* of holiness, from the womb of the dawn'). Ps. 96:5--9
strikingly combines elements of the heavens, beauty, the temple, and
priestly attire: directly following mention of the created 'heavens', it
says, 'splendor and majesty are before Him, strength and *beauty* are in
His *sanctuary*', followed by a command to 'bring an offering into His
courts' and to 'worship the L[ORD]{.small} in the splendor of holiness'
([NASB]{.small} renders 'holy attire').

Clements 1965: 67; see also his larger discussion (pp. 64--75), where
especially he cites texts from the Psalms underscoring God's rule from
the temple; e.g., Ps. 11:4, 'The L[ORD]{.small} is in His holy temple,
the L[ORD]{.small}'s throne is in heaven.' Levenson gives the same
qualified assessment as Clements that the temple was conceived as an
institution representing the cosmos (1984: 286). The assessments of
Clements and Levenson are partly a response to R. de Vaux who concludes
that in the Bible there is 'feeble support for these theories' about the
cosmological significance of the temple (1965: 328; see Levenson 1988:
82, for further response to de Vaux). He was anticipated a century
earlier by Fairbairn (1863a: 220), who asserted that a cosmological view
of Israel's temple 'is never once distinctly brought out' in the OT.

Greek Orthodox churches also reflect the tripartite structure and
symbolism of Israel's temple: an outer section, often with wall
paintings of war scenes and other depictions of activities in the world;
an inner court with two lampstands (with seven light-bulbs) on either
side of the central entrance to the next section (stars are sometimes
depicted as surrounding an image of Christ on the ceiling and a figure
of ivy is around the outside of the central door to the next section);
an inner sanctum, separated off from the middle room by a wooden
curtain, within which I have been told is an emblem of shewbread and a
copy of the Bible (e.g., note a basilica in one of the monasteries in
Meteora, Greece). Likewise, ancient Greek temples were typically divided
into three sections: outer court (with an altar and, sometimes, a
wash-basin); an inner section; an inmost sanctuary where the idol of the
god was placed. The tomb of Phillip of Macedon was apparently considered
a temple: an outside paved section called 'the road', where the king's
body was burned and burnt offerings were made for forty days; a section
entered by huge marble doors, where Phillip's wife was buried, where
also was found a large gold disc and smaller ones, all of which had
stars in the middle; the innermost section of the cultic burial site
held Phillip's remains, who was considered to be divine. For other
examples of tripartite Greek temples, see Tomlinson 1976, though see the
qualification in the next note.

Some contend that the temple consisted of three sections in addition to
the outer courtyard by including the 'forecourt' (*'ûlām*) or porch to
the holy place and that this was in contrast to the earlier three-part
tabernacle (Homan 2000: 24). The porch may just as easily be viewed as a
sacred entryway into the holy place and not a separate room with
distinct significance. The gateways into the second sections of ancient
Greek temples may well offer corroboration of this. Such gateways could
be part of temple complexes or sometimes they were absent. When they
were present, they served as mere transitional passageways; they were
'important not just for themselves' but functioned primarily as
entrances into the next sacred room and, thus, helped to 'enhance the
sense of drama, of movement into and through the sanctuary' (Tomlinson

can focus on constructing a permanent temple to signify 'rest'.

See likewise Wenham 1987: 67; cf. also Is. 56:6; cf. Kline (1989: 54),
who sees this only with respect to the priestly 'guarding' of the temple
from the profane (e.g., Kline cites Num. 1:53; 3:8, 10, 32; 8:26;
18:3ff.; 1 Sam. 7:1; 2 Kgs. 12:9; 1 Chr. 23:32; 2 Chr. 34:9; Ezek.
44:15ff.; 48:11); so similarly, Wenham 1987: 67. Similarly, Walton
(2001: 173) concludes that Adam's tasks were of a priestly nature
because of the use of the two Hebrew verbs elsewhere and the temple
atmosphere of Eden (see further pp. 172--174, for his excellent
discussion). It is a well-known grammatical problem that the word for
'garden' is masculine but the pronominal suffix on the infinitives is
feminine. Cassuto (1989: 122) and Sailhamer (1992: 100--101), followed
by Hafemann (2001: 228), note the possibility that the two infinitives
could be translated as 'serving \[or worshipping\] and guarding' rather
than 'work it and guard it'; i.e., that the forms are infinitival
gerunds and not infinitives with a feminine pronominal suffix. The
question is whether or not the mappiq in the final *he* was originally
intended; if not, then Cassuto and Sailhamer would be right (Cassuto
claims there are some Hebrew manuscripts where the mappiq, indeed, is
missing, but he does not list them). Probably, the traditional
translation is correct, especially since the two verbs in the
surrounding context bear such a sense (2:5; 4:2, 9, 12; esp. note the
two verbs close together in 3:23--24, on which see Hugenberger
(\[n.d.\]). Hugenberger notes that there are abundant examples of the
infinitive construct of both verbs throughout the OT but the forms
proposed by Cassuto and Sailhamer would be unique. Nevertheless, the two
verbs should be viewed as painted with 'cultic colors'. Cf. also Hendel
1998: 44.

Indeed, *Tg. Pseudo-Jonathon Genesis* 2:7 says that God created Adam
partly of 'dust from the site of the sanctuary'. See Scroggs (1966: 51)
for other references in Judaism that Adam was created at the location
where Israel's temple was later built: e.g., see *Tg. Pseudo-Jonathon
Genesis* 3:23; cf. also *y. Nazir* 7:2, IV.L, *Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer*
11 and 12, and *Midrash Rabbah Genesis* 14:8, which all affirm that Adam
was created at the site of the later temple, which was also at Eden or
was apparently close to it (as the latter text would imply).

*Midrash Rabbah Genesis* 16:5 interprets Adam's role in Gen. 2:15 to be
one of offering the kinds of 'sacrifices' later required by the Mosaic
Law. Early Christian interpretation comports with the same point of
view. In a context of warning the church against the 'sneak attacks' of
the devil, *Barnabas* 4:11 exhorts, 'let us become a complete temple for
God. To the best of our ability, let us *cultivate* \[*meletaō*\] the
fear of God and strive *to guard* \[*phylassō*\] his commandments'
(*Barnabas* 6 then links this temple with Adam's commission in Gen.
1:28).

Both words 'kept' and 'ward' in Neh. 12:45 are forms of *šāmar*, the
same word used for Adam's task in Gen. 2:15 and of the cherubim's task

temples, participating in decoration and construction, as well as
'managing . . . land registered to the temples' (Finnestad 1997: 228).

I am indebted to Ross (1988: 124) for the connotations of the verb in
Gen. 2:15. Notice that Heb. 4 compares God's rest after creation to that
of Israel's rest, which may suggest that the same analogy could be drawn
between God's rest and Adam's.

For Solomon's temple as an intentional replication of the Garden of
Eden, especially in its arboreal likeness, see Stager 2000: 36--47, 66;
1999: 183--193 (though, because of his view of dating OT sources, he
actually sees the temple as the model for Eden in the latter article and
is unclear in the former); he also notes likenesses with other ANE
temples containing gardens or garden depictions on their walls that also
reflect the essential characteristics of the Garden of Eden (on which
likewise see Keel \[1985: 124--151\] and Yarden \[1971: 38\], where
iconographic examples are found). See also Josephus (*Ant.* 3.124--126),
who observed that the curtain separating the holy of holies from the
holy place in the 'second temple' was woven 'with every manner of flower
that earth produces'; likewise, 'the gate opening into the \[temple\]
building . . . had . . . above it those golden vines from which depended
grapeclusters as tall as a man . . .' (Josephus, *War* 5.210; almost
identically, see Josephus, *Ant.* 15.395). *Midrash Rabbah Numbers *13:2
identifies the tabernacle as a replication of God's dwelling in the
Garden of Eden.

discussion there summarizing the work of Stordalen 2000: 352. See also
Greenberg 1997: 591, who sees that Ezek. 28:11--19 fuses together the
Garden of Eden and the temple; he sees that the passage strongly evokes
the Jerusalem temple because of the following elements: (1) reference to
'the holy mountain of God', which Zion was sometimes called; (2)
reference to the 'cherub who guards' (Ezek. 28:14, 16) reflects the
cherub figures around the ark of the covenant and woven into the
temple's curtains (e.g., 1 Kgs. 6:23--35); (3) the cherubim in the midst
of coals of fire (cf. Ezek. 1:13; 10:2 and 28:14, 16). See also *Books
of Adam and Eve* (Armenian version), pericope 5.16.2--3, where Satan is

The Martínez--Tigchelaar Hebrew--English edition rightly supplies the
lacunae with 'over all' because of the following parallelism with 'over
all the angels' \[literally 'gods'\], though in Martínez's earlier
English edition he did not do so and gave an otherwise quite different
translation, which does not reflect the Hebrew as well as the later
translation.

Our translation follows Dupont-Sommer, who is the only translator who
supplies the second lacuna of the line with 'Eden.' The translations of
Martínez, Gaster and Wise et al. supply 'light' instead of 'Eden'. If
'Eden' is not explicitly referred to here, the setting of the
'seven-fold light' is still most probably understood to be Eden, since
descriptions of the Garden of Eden together with 'fire' and 'light' are
close by in the context, where 'Eden' *is* explicitly mentioned (1QH
6.15--18 and 8.4--22); cf. also God causing 'salvation to flower and the
Shoot to grow' in the directly preceding lines of 7.19. Such a context
may point, indeed, to the plausibility of Dupont-Sommer's translation,
but our point is not dependent on it.

Pseudo-Philo, *Biblical Antiquities*, 25--26, asserts that twelve
precious stones almost identical to those composing the vestments of the
high priest (see Exod. 28) were originally taken by the Amorites 'from
the land of Havilah', and used for idolatry until they were taken by
Israel and placed in the ark of the temple. At the time of Israel's
latter-day redemption one will come and 'build a house for my \[God's\]
name' (26:12) and then the stones will be restored to all of the
righteous.

Another early text linking Gen. 1:26, 28 to Gen. 2 is the Qumran passage
of 4Q504 = 4QWords of the Luminaries (frag. 8 Recto, lines 4--6): 'You
molded \[Adam\], our \[fa\]ther, in the image of \[your\] glory . . .
\[in the gard\]en of Eden, which you planted, y\[ou\] made him to rule .
. . in order that he would walk in a glorious earth', and 'he guarded';
so also 4Q423 = 4Q *Instruction^g^* (frag. 2, line 2): 'is it not a
garden . . . to rule

. . . And over it he made you (Adam) to rule, to till it and to guard
it'. Likewise, though not quite as clearly, 4Q418, frag. 81 (= 4Q423 8 +

We are not able here to enter into the problem of whether Gen. 1:28 is
merely a 'blessing . . . delineating a privilege' (Walton 2001: 134) or
whether it is a blessing that includes a mandate or command.
Traditionally, it has been called a 'creation mandate', and with this we
essentially agree. Joüon concludes that in Gen. 1:28 all 'five
imperatives are direct imperatives', with the explicit sense of a direct
command (1993: 373). Gesenius et al. construe Gen. 1:28 as command, 'the
fulfillment of which is altogether out of the power of the one
addressed', which has the force of an 'assurance' or 'promise' (1970:
324). Wenham combines the two preceding views: 'This command . . .
carries with it an implicit promise that God will enable man to fulfill
it' (1987: 33). Wenham's conclusion is pointed to by observing that
imperatives are used as commands in the restatement of Gen. 1:28 to
Abraham (Gen. 12:1--2: 'Go forth from your country . . . and you will be
a blessing') and to Jacob (Gen. 35:11, 'be fruitful and multiply'). Some
see the verb 'bless' in Gen. 12:2 to be a basic imperative (so Carroll
2000: 22, who cites others in support). Some grammarians see Gen. 12:2
as part of a promise (e.g., see Gesenius et al. 1970: 325), while others
view it as an 'indirect imperative' expressing purpose or result (Joüon
1993: 385; cf. Carroll 2000: 22, who cites others who view the
construction to be conveying consequence or purpose). But the context of
such 'indirect' uses of the imperative may indicate that they retain a
notion of 'command' (e.g., Exod. 3:10, an example adduced in Gesenius et
al.: 'Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, *so that you
may bring out* my people'; cf. in light of Exod. 3:11; 4:21--23;
6:10--13) (1970: 325). Apparently, on this basis, Ross (1988: 263) sees
that the last imperative of 12:2 emphasizes the purpose of the divine
blessing yet still 'retains an imperatival force' (Carroll's discussion
approaches the same conclusion).

This was first brought to my attention by N. T. Wright 1992a: 21--26,
upon which the above list of references in Genesis is based. Wright sees
that the command to Adam in Gen. 1:26--28 has been applied to the
patriarchs and Israel; he also cites other texts where he sees Gen. 1:28
applied to Israel (Exod. 32:13; Lev. 26:9; Deut. 1:10f.; 7:13f.; 8:1;
28:63; 30:5, 16). I have subsequently likewise discovered that Cohen
(1989: 28--31, 39) makes the same observation in dependence on G. V.
Smith (1977: 207--319), who both include Noah. See also Dumbrell 1994:
29--30, 37, 72--73, 143 for the notion that the blessings conditionally
promised to Adam are given to Israel. Likewise, Gage affirms only
generally that the 'divine command (or creative mandate) originally
pronounced to Adam . . . (Gen. 1:28), is formalized covenantally through
three administrations (i.e., three mediators: Noah, Abraham and David)'
(1984: 29). Cf. also Carroll 2000: 27, who says only briefly that the
divine intention to bless humankind is reaffirmed in Gen. 12:1--3. Cf.
similarly Fishbane 1979: 112--113. Jewish tradition applies the Gen.
1:28 commission to Noah and Abraham (*Midrash Tanhuma Genesis* 3:5;
likewise *Tanhuma Yelammedenu* 2:12).

The combination of 'tent' (*'ōhēl*) and 'altar' (*mizbēah*) occur in
Exodus and Leviticus only with respect to the tabernacle and associated
altar (e.g., Lev. 4:7, 18). 'Altar' (*mizbēah*) and 'house' (*bayit*)
occur 28 times in the OT with reference to the temple and its altar.
Rarely do any of the words in these two combinations ever refer to
anything else other than the tabernacle or temple. The building of these
worship sites on a mountain may represent part of a pattern finding its
climax in Israel's later temple that was built on Mount Zion (the
traditional site of Mount Moriah), which itself becomes a synecdoche of
the whole for the part in referring to the temple (pp. 145--146). We do
not mean to say that 'tent' in the patriarchal episodes is equivalent to
the later tabernacle, only that it resonates with tabernacle-like
associations because of its proximity to the worship site.

Later midrashic exegesis on the temple may have been partly inspired by
Gen. 1:26--28 in its understanding that the temple brought the blessing
of fertility, even of children. While some of these references are
speculative and fanciful, they show, nevertheless, an awareness of some
kind of a relationship between Gen. 1:28 and the temple. For example,
one midrashic source says, 'Why was the Sanctuary compared to a couch?
Because just as this couch serves fruitfulness and multiplication (i.e.
sexual intercourse), even so the Sanctuary, everything that was in it
was fruitful and multiplied' (cited in Patai 1967: 90). In addition, the
same Jewish source affirms, 'just as the forest is fruitful and
multiplies, even so the Sanctuary, everything that was in it was
fruitful and multiplied' (cited in Patai 1967: 90). So also *Midrash
Rabbah Numbers *11:3; *b. Yoma* 39b. 'During the three months in which
the Ark of the Lord was kept in the house of Obed Edom, each one of the
wives of his eight sons gave birth to a child every two weeks. It was
the Ark then, in which lay the power of fertility' (Patai 1967: 90,
citing *y. Yebamot* 6b.; cf. *b. Berakoth* 63b--64a; *Midrash Rabbah
Numbers *4:20; *Midrash Rabbah Song of Songs* 2:5). Likewise, the
existence of the temple and the rites performed therein procured
blessing and fruitfulness for Israel (and implicitly the earth in
general; so Patai 1967: 122--128). For example, 'The world stands . . .
on the temple service: how so? So long as the Temple service is
maintained, the world is a blessing to its inhabitants and the rains
come down in season . . . But when the Temple service is not maintained,
the world is not a blessing to its inhabitants and the rains do not come
down in season . . .' (*The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan* 4; I am
grateful to Patai for alerting me to the preceding Jewish sources). That
these sources are developing a biblical concept is evident from Hag.
1:9--11 that says Israel was unfruitful because they had been
disobedient by not building the temple. *Midrash Rabbah Song of Songs*
1:16 §3 notes that building the first and second temple resulted in a
radical increase of Israel's population.

Similarly, with respect to Gen. 12:6--8 see Cassuto 1964: 328--329.
Cassuto (1964:325--326) argues that the worship site at the 'oak of
Moreh' in Shechem that Abraham established had become a 'sanctuary', at
least by the time Jacob went there and performed cultic rituals in
preparation for re-establishing another similar site at Bethel (Gen.
35:1--15); Cassuto also identifies the site with the place where Israel
later set up an altar in Deut. 27:5--7, which is inextricably linked
there with Israel's tabernacle (on which cf. Josh. 8:30--35).
A. Dillmann says with respect to Gen. 12:7 (and implicitly of the other
patriarchal altar building episodes) that 'the building of a sanctuary
(subsequently in Jerusalem or Bethel) was a less simple form of the same
practice' performed by the patriarchs and that these patriarchal
activities 'were regarded as patterns for a later time' (1892: 15). See
also Driver 1904: 143, who says that these sites 'in later times were
regarded as sanctuaries' because of the earlier altar building
activities of the patriarchs.

In addition to the subsequent temple built in Bethel, Israel's
tabernacle subsequently came to rest for a long time in Shiloh, which
was located near Bethel and Shechem (so Judg. 21:19), locations where
Abraham had set up shrines. The tabernacle remained there, at least,
during the time of Joshua and the Judges (on which see the references to
'Shiloh' in Joshua, Judges and 1 Samuel). This would be another example
of a smaller sanctuary being succeeded by a bigger one. There is some
debate about whether or not an actual temple structure was built there,
since 1 Samuel employs language apparently more fitting for a temple
than a tabernacle: e.g., 1 Sam. 1:9, 'Now Eli the priest was sitting on
the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the L[ORD]{.small}' (so
likewise 1 Sam. 3:3; the word is *hêkāl*, used predominately of Israel's
temple structure or God's heavenly temple but never of the tabernacle).
Most likely, though, there was only a tabernacle in Shiloh, since the
phrase 'house of the Lord' and 'house of God' is also used in 1 Sam.
1:7, 24 and 3:15 and the same phrase was also used of the tabernacle
(Exod. 23:19; 34:26; Deut. 23:18; Josh. 6:24; 1 Chr. 6:48; cf. 'house of
my God' in Josh. 9:23). Also, 1 Sam. 2:22 speaks of 'the doorway of the
tent of meeting', likely the same location referred to in 1:9.
Furthermore, Ps. 78:60 summarizes God's dwelling in Shiloh as being a
tabernacle: God 'abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, the tent which
He had pitched among men'. Even if there were some kind of temple
structure, 1 Sam. 2:35 says that God's dwelling in Shiloh was not an
'enduring house' but was to be succeeded by one which would be.

E.g., Is. 2:2 refers to 'the mountain of the house of the
L[ORD]{.small}', and then 2:3 refers to the same thing with the phrase
'let us go up to the mountain of the L[ORD]{.small}, to the house of the
God of Jacob' (so identically Mic. 4:1--2). The precise phrase 'the
mountain of God' refers elsewhere in the OT only five times to Mount
Sinai (Exod. 3:1; 4:27; 18:5; 24:13; 1 Kgs. 19:8) and twice to the
Garden of Eden (Ezek. 28:14, 16), both, as we have seen, being
sanctuary-like sacred locations; in Dan. 9:20 'the holy mountain of my
God' focuses on Israel's temple (though Pagolu demurs on identifying
Moriah with Mount Zion in Jerusalem \[1998: 67\]).

That this episode points to the building of a large temple is further
apparent from noticing that Gen. 28:22 directly links the 'stone' of
'God's house' with Jacob pledging that 'of all that you give me I will
surely give a tenth to you'. Israelites are later to give a 'tenth' to
the temple or to those who serve in the temple (so approximately 18
times, mostly in Lev., Num. and Deut., as well as in Heb. 7:5). Notable
exceptions to this are Abraham giving a 'tenth' to Melchizedek (Gen.
14:20; Heb. 7:6) and the Israelites giving a 'tenth' to their king (1
Sam. 8:15, 17).

In support of this point, see also Gamberoni, '*Māqôm*', *TDOT*, 8:538;
the same word is used of the first place that Abraham set up an altar
probably with the same notion of 'sacred place' (following Driver 1904:
146). This suggestion is enhanced by observing that, after 28:11, the
Hebrew word 'place' occurs seven more times in Gen. 28 and 35 with
reference to God appearing to Jacob there or with reference to Jacob
calling the site 'Bethel' ('House of God'). This use of 'place' as a
special sanctuary site takes on even more significance when it is
remembered that the same word not untypically refers to the tabernacle
and temple, or things related to the temple, later in the OT (on which
see Gamberoni, '*Māqôm*', *TDOT*, 8:537--543).

In Mesopotamian mythology, a messenger of the gods would use a stairway
to move from a heavenly realm to an earthly or netherworld sphere. 'It
is this same stairway that is architecturally depicted in the famous
ziggurats that adjoined temples in Mesopotamian cities, designed to
offer a way for the gods to descend to the temple \[on earth\] to be
worshipped' (Walton 2001: 571; likewise, Skinner 1910: 377--378, and
Speiser 1982: 219--220). Typically, at the stairway's top was a gate to
heaven and at the bottom was a temple for the divine being to rest in
and be refreshed after the journey down from heaven (Speiser 1982:
373--374). Indeed, the Hebrew word 'stairway' (*sullām*) is cognate to
the Akkadian *simmiltu* that was used to refer to a heavenly 'stairway'
linked to a temple (Ross 1988: 488--489).

Cf. Fishbane 1979: 115, who sees the Gen. 28 episode as a 'counterpoint'
to the 'temple-tower' of Babel. B. K. Waltke adds to Fishbane's
conclusion by observing that 'the Semites understood the name *Babylon*
to have been derived from *bābilî*, "gate of God" (11:9)' (2001: 392).
The identification of Bethel as 'gate of heaven' may be intended as a
counterpoint to 'Babylon', which apparently had its origin in connection
with the 'tower of Babel' episode, where the name 'Babel' in Gen. 11:9
occurs.

tree at (or in the vicinity of) Bethel, there may well have been one
there because of the mention of a tree at the site in Gen. 35:6--15.
Similarly, Isaac's building of an altar in Beersheba (Gen. 26:25) must
also have been placed directly next to a tree, since Abraham had
'planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba' and worshipped there.

Westermann contends that the trees at these sites indicate an 'early
type of sanctuary' but not a temple, since there is no 'cultic
institution, personnel, or building' (1995: 154--157, 181).
Nevertheless, there can still be the essence of a 'temple' without these
latter three formal elements, as we have argued above in our attempt to
demonstrate that Eden was functionally a temple. Indeed, just as Adam
was a priestly figure, so likely are the patriarchs. Hence, it is better
to view the patriarchal worship sites, like Eden, as inchoate or
embryonic sanctuaries or informal temples, pointing to Israel's later
tabernacle and temple.

text identifies a heavenly 'sanctuary-house' that existed above the
place apparently, at least, since the time of Jacob's small-scale
building activities recorded in Gen. 28. David and Solomon were
completing a temple-building process begun with the patriarchs wherein
the earthly temple was to reflect the heavenly (accordingly, *Tg. 2

So Woudstra 1970: 98. We will see later that the NT understands Ezek.
3:26--28 to refer to the church as the gathered people of God wherever
they may dwell on the earth (2 Cor. 6:16), in heaven (Rev. 7:15) or in
the new cosmos (Rev. 21:3). See D. I. Block (1998: 421), who agrees that
the preposition '*al* is to be translated '*over* them' but sees this
only as a possible reflection of the glory of the Lord that resided over
the tent of meeting in the wilderness. The usual rendering of the
preposition when not designating a logical function ('because, on the
ground of, etc.') is 'upon, over, on' (see BDB, 752ff.). Notions of 'by,
beside, together with' are less usual but certainly possible, depending
on context. The context in the present passage may favour the usual use
though it permits 'with' as well. The use of this preposition directly
following the noun 'tabernacle' (*miškān*, connoting that it is 'over'
something else) occurs only here. Elsewhere (approximately 36 times,
almost exclusively in Exodus and Numbers) the noun always follows the
preposition and almost always refers to something being 'over' the
'tabernacle', often the glorious presence of God. The unique use in
Ezekiel appears to suggest that God's latter-day presence will become
equated with the tabernacle and that it will extend not merely in the
midst of but 'over' all his people.

fruitfulness for Israel (and implicitly the earth in general; so Patai

So Pss. 43:3; 46:4; 84:1--4; 132:5, 7; so also Lev. 21:23; Ezek. 7:24;
Jer. 51:51; e.g.,

Ps. 84:1--4 equates God's 'dwelling places' with his 'courts' and his
'house'; following Stordalen (2000: 443), who concludes that the plural
in Num. 24:5 refers to 'the tabernacle and its surrounding camp', and
would later have been identified as 'the dwellings of Israel around the
House of YHWH in Zion' (especially, in light of the same two plurals in
Jer. 30:18 which refer to Jerusalem). See also *Judith* 4:12; 16:20; 1
Maccabees 3:43, 58--59 for *ta hagia* ('the holies') as a reference to
the one sanctuary (following Ellingworth 1993: 400). Note also that
Philo sometimes refers to 'the Holy of Holies' as 'the Holies of Holies'
(*Leg. All*. 2.56; *Mut. Nom*. 192) or 'the innermost places of the
Holies' (*Som*. 1.216). The Hebrew words rendered 'tents' and
'dwellings' in Num. 24:5 are respectively *'ōhel* and *miškān*, the
typical words referring to Israel's tabernacle. 1 Chr. 17:5 refers to
God during the pre-Solomonic period as having 'gone from tent to tent
and from one dwelling place to another'. Job 21:28 refers to the 'tent,
the dwelling places of the wicked'.

This rendering is the result of reading the Hebrew *'ăhālîm* ('aloes')
as *'ǒhālîm* ('tents') either unintentionally or, more probably,
consciously under the influence of 'tents' in verse 5 (cf. McNamara
1995: 137). Almost identically, as we saw above, the [LXX]{.small} reads
here 'as *tabernacles* \[or tents = *skēnē*\] pitched by the
L[ORD]{.small}'. The similarity of the Hebrew word for 'aloes' and
'tents' facilitated an interpretation by the Greek and Aramaic
translator by which 'tents' representing the whole garden (recalling the
Eden equation with tabernacle) is substituted by synecdoche for 'aloes'
as part of a garden (note reference to 'tents' and 'gardens' in the
directly preceding phrases). In contrast to *Tg. Neofiti*, cf.
Etheridge, who cites the somewhat different rendering of the Palestinian
Fragment Targum: 'as the heavens which the Memra spread forth for the
dwelling of His Shekinah, so shall Israel live . . .' (1968: 428--429).

Jacob would 'possess' the land are Gen. 22:17; 24:60, Num. 14:24; Is.
65:9; and Ps. 25:13. Perhaps Gen. 22:17 and 24:60 are echoed
secondarily, since they speak of expansion through the multiplication of
seed. Other possible parallels are Exod. 34:24, which speaks of
'enlarging your \[Israel's\] borders' (cf. Is. 53:2), while Ps. 44:2
refers to God 'spreading them \[Israel\] abroad', though the latter text
employs a different Hebrew word than found in Gen. 28:14 and Is. 54:3.

1 Kgs. 6:7 says that Solomon's temple 'was built of stone prepared at
the quarry'. Perhaps not coincidentally, the 1 Kings verse goes on to
say that no tool, not even a 'hammer' (*maqqebet*) was used to prepare
the stones on site. Literally, the Hebrew for 'hammer' could be rendered
a 'piercing instrument' or 'piercing tool', the very same word found in
Is. 51:1: literally, 'the excavation \[or 'piercing' or 'hammering'\]
pit from which you were dug' (though BDB, 666, categorizes the noun in
Is. 51:1 as a different noun from 'hammer', there appear to be no
ultimate grounds for doing so). It may merely be that in Is. 51:1 there
is a metonymy of the cause for the effect: piercing with a hammer is
substituted for the usual Hebrew word for 'excavation' in order to
highlight the element of construction. The word occurs elsewhere only at
Is. 44:12 and Jer. 10:4, both referring to a 'hammer'.

We are not so interested to discuss whether the cosmic conflagration
language is literal or not, but are content to understand these texts
affirming, at least, a renovated and purified new world system in
contrast to the old, sinful world epoch. Our ultimate judgment on the
issue is that the Isaiah prophecies begin fulfilment in the NT age in a
'non-physical' manner and have consummate fulfilment physically as well.
For further discussion of the nature of this language, see the
subsequent section on Acts below (pp. 211--216) and Beale 1999a: *in

The link between Dan. 2 and Gen. 1 may be pointed to further by
recognizing the parallel between the four sections of the statue that
are demolished and replaced by God's eternal kingdom and the four
beastly kingdoms that are judged and replaced by God's eternal kingdom
in Dan. 7. In this respect, a number of commentators note that the
portrayal in Dan. 7 alludes to the remnant of Israel as God's true
humanity, a kind of corporate Adam figure, who has been given dominion
over 'beasts' that had formerly persecuted them (so, e.g., N. T. Wright
1992: 23; Lacocque 1979: 128--129, 132--133). In both Dan. 2 and 7 God's
kingdom replaces the ungodly kingdoms who had abused the rule over
creation that God had placed into their hands.

For the plural 'sanctuaries' being a reference to the temple, see the
above discussion of Num. 24:5. In addition, see further Van Dijk (1968:
122) for the notion that the plural 'sanctuaries' in Ezek. 28:18 refers
to 'a single temple and denotes a single sanctuary with its precincts'.
Especially see Stordalen (2000: 352), who also notes the plural use of
'sanctuaries' (*miqdāš*) in application to Israel's one tabernacle (Lev.
21:23) or temple in Jerusalem (Ezek. 7:24), one of the best examples
being Jer. 51:51: 'For aliens have entered the holy places of the
L[ORD]{.small}'s house.' This is significant, since Ezek. 28:18 says,
'You profaned your sanctuaries', especially since whenever the OT refers
to the 'sanctuary' (*miqdāš*) being 'profaned' (*[ḥ]{.mev1}ālal*), it
refers always either to Israel's tabernacle or temple in Jerusalem (so
seven times outside of Ezek. 28, two of which, as we saw above, are
plural, on which see Stordalen 2000: 352). The use in Ezek. 28:18 may be
like that in Jer. 51, conceiving of the temple as containing multiple
'holy spaces' or 'sanctuaries', which would be, at least, the outer
court, the inner holy place, and the innermost holy of holies
(accordingly Is. 62:9 mentions 'courts of My sanctuary'; likewise,
virtually identically, see Ps. 65:4, where 'Thy courts' equals 'Thy
house' and 'Thy holy temple'; similarly, see Pss. 84:3; 96:8, following
Van Dijk 1968: 122). Alternatively, the plural in Ezek. 28:18 may be an
emphatic plural 'used because the subject was a scandalous profanation
of the most important temple' (Stordalen 1968: 352). Cf. also John 14:2:
'In my Father's house are *many dwelling-places* (*monai pollai*)'.

a growing eschatological temple-mount in common between Dan. 2 and Is.
2. Some commentators see Is. 2 (and Mic. 4) as a close parallel (Collins
1993: 165 and Porteous 1965: 50), though Russell 1981: 53 sees the

own (Levenson 1986: 32--61; 1984: 296--298; 1985: 182--184). W. Dumbrell
draws some of the same conclusions as I have drawn, especially with
regard to Adam being placed as a 'king-priest' in Eden as a sanctuary in
order to expand the sanctuary worldwide (2002: 53--65). In so doing, he
expresses dependence partly on my earlier commentary excursus (Beale
1999a: 1109--1111), as well as some of the sources upon which I was
originally dependent (e.g., Wenham 1987; 1994). Here Dumbrell actually
develops similar thoughts from his earlier work (1985: 37--38, 41--42).
Likewise, Kline 1989: 55--56, 62--63, briefly anticipated my thesis, and
it is quite possible that years ago my reading of Kline and Dumbrell's
earlier work planted the seed of this idea in my mind.

McCartney 1994: 10. McCartney also mentions that Jesus' proclamations of
the kingdom are expressions that the vicegerency lost with the first
Adam was now being announced and his power over nature was another
example of exercising the dominion over the earth as God's vice-regent,
which the first Adam should have exercised (1994: 10). Cf. also Kline
(1989: 65--67), who makes the suggestive observation that 'the tree of
the discernment of good and evil' in Gen. 2 refers to Adam's duty to
discern between good and evil, so that when the serpent entered the
Garden, he was to judge the serpent as an evildoer. Kline supports this
partly by adducing other texts which refer to a discerning between 'good
and evil' as the exercise of 'a legal-judicial kind of discrimination'
(Is. 5:20, 23; Mal. 2:17), such as 'a king engaged in rendering judicial
decisions' (2 Sam. 14:17; 1 Kgs. 3:9, 28).

Davies and Allison (1991: 176, 180) suggest that the vineyard 'tower' in
Matt. 21:33 is equated with the temple, especially on the basis of the
following Jewish sources: *b. Sukkah* 49a interprets the 'choicest vine'
of Is. 5:2 to be the temple; *1 Enoch* 89:41--77 identifies the 'tower'
of the 'house' (= Jerusalem) to be the temple (on which, e.g., see Black
1985: 269, 273); 4Q500 seems to locate the 'winepress' of Is. 5:2 at the
gate of the temple on Mount Zion (so Baumgarten 1989: 1--6), who
suggests that the location of Eden is combined with that of Jerusalem's
temple mount).

See p. 46 above for references in Josephus and Philo for the heavenly
symbolism of all the curtains in the temple. However, see Ulansey (2001:
123--125), who builds on earlier studies arguing that the tearing of the
heavens in Mark 1:10 is linked to the tearing of the veil in 15:38, as
an inclusio designating the beginning and ending of Jesus' ministry. He
then contends that the veil is the outer veil, since Josephus (*War*
5.212--215) says on the outer veil was embroidery 'that typified the
universe' and that 'portrayed a panorama of the heavens'.

See Schneider, '*katapetasma*', *TDNT*, 3:628--630. Gurtner (2003) has
advanced Schneider's argument further by elaborating on three
theological aspects of the innermost veil's separating function, which
are not functions of the outer veils: (1) a distinction between the
*most* holy and less holy; (2) an impediment to the atoning effect of
the blood of the sin offering (cf. Lev. 4:6, 17), so that its sprinkling
would not progress to the 'mercy seat'; (3) a barrier to the physical
and visible accessibility of God's most holy presence. Matthew's context
shows that these three functions ceased with the death of Christ.
According to Gurtner, also in favour of a reference to the innermost
veil is the observation that of the 34 times *katapetasma* is used in
the [LXX]{.small}, 32 are translations of *pārōket*, which refers to the
inmost curtain.

This purpose is explained in *Sibylline Oracles* 8:303, 305 \[c.

the temple will be rent'). Note that throughout this section, I have
focused more on segments in Matthew in tracing the theme of the temple.
See Heil 1997 for a brilliant analysis of Mark 11:1 -- 15:41, showing
how the denunciation, destruction or replacement of the temple in Jesus
and his followers is the key to the narrative strategy at every point!
There is not space to summarize the argument, but a number of his points

Gundry (1993: 885--907) views the wording of Mark 14:58 to be purely
false testimony, and that Jesus never made a claim to destroy the temple
and rebuild it. But, following Carson (1995: 554) and France (1985:
378--379), the testimony was false, not because Jesus did not make the
statement but because of the evil intent and the disregard of the true
meaning of Jesus' saying recorded in John 2:19 (which Gundry does not
believe is authentic to Jesus). From another perspective, see Juel
(1977: 124, 169, 205--206) and Chronis (1982: 108, 112), who say that
within the overall narrative structure of Mark the false testimony
ironically becomes fulfilled prophecy at Jesus' death and resurrection.

Numbers *13:2; 18:21; *Midrash Rabbah Leviticus* 9:6; *Midrash Rabbah

4Q174, 1.3--7 and *4 Ezra* 13:6--7, 35--36 affirm that the messiah would
build the end-time temple, the latter of which is supported by our
earlier extended analysis of the Dan. 2 stone-mountain being an end-time
temple (see ch. 4). Following Clowney, see Pusey 1885: 374--375 for the
messianic associations with 'branch' in Zech. 6:12, including Jewish
identifications of Zech. 6:12 as messianic.

Whether the 'innermost being' refers to Jesus or to the believer is not
necessarily a crucial issue to solve, since v. 37 clearly posits Jesus
as the ultimate source of the water and v. 39 implicitly sees Jesus as
the source of the Spirit, of which the water is a symbol (especially in
light of 20:22 Jesus is the source of the Spirit). Even if the
'innermost being' refers to the believer in v. 38, Jesus is still the
implied ultimate source of the water who causes an abundant flow from
the believer's heart. Nevertheless, I prefer that Jesus is explicitly
the one from whom living waters flow in v. 38. On the debate see Carson
(1991: 322--329), who prefers that the 'innermost being' refers to the
believer.

On which see further Edersheim 1994: 220--227. Likewise, on the last day
of the feast there was a great bonfire in one of the outer temple
courts, so that 'there was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that did not
reflect the light' of that fire (*m. Sukkah* 5.2--3). Early the next
morning after the bonfire, Jesus proclaims in the temple, 'I am the
light of the world; he who follows Me shall not walk in the darkness,
but shall have the light of life' (John 8:12). Again, he appears to be
identifying himself with the temple by representing himself as the light
of the temple. See similarly Walker (1996: 167--170), who also notes
that John portrays Jesus to be fulfilling the theological ideas
associated with the feast of Passover (see John 13:1; 18:28; 19:14, 26).

Another passge in John that may refer to the end-time temple is 14:2--3,
on which, see Beale (1999a: 648--649) and S. M. Bryan (forthcoming), the
latter especially for the argument that the plural 'dwelling places'
reflects early Jewish expectations that all saints would have a dwelling
place in the future temple.

Despite the plausible protestations of Walton (1995: 166), who does not
see disobedience to the Genesis mandate at Babel. My view of Babel in
relation to Gen. 1:28 follows the majority of commentators, which I
still find most convincing, especially in the light of the development
of Gen. 1:28 throughout the OT and humanity's disobedience to it, both
before and after Babel.

In this regard, Philo's first-century description of God's appearance at
Sinai may not be a haphazard parallel: God's revelation came 'from
heaven' being like a 'flame' (*pyr* and *phlox*) that became 'a dialect'
(*dialektos*) which caused 'amazement' (Philo, *Decal*. 46, a parallel
noted by several commentators; note the identical wording in Acts 2:3
and 2:6). Philo's rendering is not that far removed from the account in
the book of Exodus, where 'voices' is closely linked to 'torches' of
fire: 'all the people saw the voices and the torches' (Exod. 20:18;
'torches' of fire also describe a heavenly temple scene in Ezek. 1:13).

Niehaus 1995: 307--308. The heavenly temple scene in Is. 6 involves
fiery images of God's presence resulting both in blessing (6:6) and in
judgment (6:13). Note also, the combined use in Is. 5:24 and 6:6--7 of
'fire' (on which, see Ziegler 1983: 143 for Is. 6) and terms associated
with the mouth (respectively 'tongue' and 'mouth'/'lips'). In this

examples in the OT of figurative cosmic disruption language are: above
all, 2 Sam. 22:8--16 (= Ps. 18:7--15), figuratively referring to David's
victory over his enemies; Eccles. 12:1--2, referring to human death; Is.

Both Synoptic texts signal judgment on Israel in [AD]{.small} 70, though
it is possible that they refer to the very end of history at Christ's
second coming; on the synoptic passages see France (1971: 227--239), who
contends for an [AD]{.small} 70 application, and see Carson (1995:
488--509), who opts for a second-coming reference, though he admits the
cosmic destruction language could be metaphorical for the end of a
political kingdom. Possibly, both are true: the events of [AD]{.small}
70 point typologically to the events at the very end of the world. Space

Rev. 4:1 (cf. with 4:3, 11); see likewise John 1:51, which we have seen
to be associated closely with the temple (cf. with John 1:14 where
Christ 'tabernacled' and his 'glory' was beheld). See also *Testament of

and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove coming upon him'):
'the heavens were opened, and from the temple of glory sanctification
will come upon him . . .' Similarly, *Testament of Levi* 2:6--10
portrays Levi saying, 'And behold, the heavens were opened' directly
before he enters a threetiered heaven, which probably was a heavenly
temple, since in the last tier Levi was to 'stand near the Lord' and 'be
his priest'. Dumbrell (1985: 68) also understands that Stephen sees
Christ in the heavenly temple.

The word *cheiropoiētos* ('handmade') occurs 14 times in the Greek OT
and always refers to idols! Outside Acts 7:48, the word in the NT occurs
five times, once with respect to pagan temples (Acts 17:24), three times
to the Jerusalem temple that was passing away (Mark 14:58; Heb. 9:11,
24), and once with regard to physical circumcision that was not true
circumcision (Eph. 2:11). The wording 'the work of men's hands' in the
Greek OT refers without exception to idols (these observations follow
Moule, 1950: 34). Among the approximately 54 times the Hebrew phrase
'work of the hands' (*ma'a˘ seh* + *yād*) occurs, almost half refer to

Sylva (1987) argues that Acts 7:45--46 is only an affirmation 'of God's
transcendence over the temple' rather than a denunciation of the temple
or replacement of the temple by Christ. My argument, on the other hand,
is that all three of these are in mind. The high points of my
disagreement with Sylva's argument rests on: (1) his understanding of
the use of 1 Kgs. 8:27 (= 2 Chr. 6:18b) in Acts 7:49--50 to the
exclusion of any attempt to understand the Is. 66:1--2 citation there
and (2) his belief that the use of Mark 14:58 in Acts 6:14 carries with
it no implicit reference to Christ's resurrection from Mark 14:58 (which
is difficult to accept, especially because of the allusion to Christ's
resurrection saying from Mark 14:62 and 16:19 \[cf. also Matt. 16:64;

connotations in the NT of 'handmade' vs. 'made without hands'; (4) the
organic links with Acts 15:16--18 and 17:24--25, on which see below. On
the other hand, Simon (1951: 127--142) goes too far the other way and
believes that Stephen held that the very existence of the temple was not
God-ordained, but idolatrous from the very beginning of its construction
by Solomon. Marshall (forthcoming, c. 2006) grants the possibility of
Sylva's view but does not see how it could constitute a plausible answer
to the charge against Stephen that Christ would destroy the temple
(Acts 6:14); he sees that a better answer is the contention that there
would be a new temple to replace the old.

The Qumran *Damascus Document* (CD 7.15--16) also quotes Amos 9:11 and

re-established in Israel. This might not be so unrelated to the
identification in 4QFlorilegium as might first appear, since, as
discussed in an earlier section, the 'wisdom' of the law was understood
to reside in the temple, from which all ethical life was to be ordered.
Further connection between the two passages is that the erection of the
temple in 4QFlorilegium occurs when the 'Seeker' or 'Interpreter of the

This interpretation was likely fuelled by reflection on the phrase
'Gentiles who are called by My name', since, without exception this
phrase 'called by My name \[or the name of the Lord\]' is positive
throughout the OT, always referring to Israel as God's people (see
Deut. 28:10; 2 Chr. 7:14; Is. 43:7; Jer. 14:9; cf. Is. 63:19). The
implication of the phrase in Amos 9:12 is that the Gentiles will become
God's people, so that the notion in the Hebrew text of Israel
'possessing' the Gentiles takes on a more positive note of spiritual
conversion.

We noted in ch. 4 that Ezek. 17 ([LXX]{.small}) speaks of Israel through

land, and sowed it in a cultivated field planted by much water' (17:5),
and this field needed to be 'watered' for 'the growth of her plantation'
(17:7; the words 'planted', 'plantation' and 'watered' are the same as
in 1 Cor. 3, though 'cultivated field' (*pedion*) and 'growth' (*bōlos*)
in Ezekiel are synonyms respectively of *geōrgion* and *auxanō* in Paul.

Similarly, Ps. 52:8 says, 'But as for me, I am like a green olive tree
in the house of God'; similarly, recall that Israel's 'tabernacles' were
like 'gardens beside the river, like aloes planted by the
L[ORD]{.small}' (Num. 24:5--7; cf. also [LXX]{.small}; Hos. 14:5--8).
Gärtner (1965: 65) notes that the Qumran depictions of the community as
a temple and plantation influenced Paul's description here. He has not
seen that these combinations occur in the OT and Judaism and that the
garden imagery is another way of speaking of the temple, and that Paul
shows familiarity with it. For the most relevant passages in Qumran, see
1QS 8.5--8; 11.4--5, 7--8 and 1QH 6.15--19, 26--27. Note also that after
Levi sees a heavenly temple with the Lord in it, an angel says to him,
'your life will be from the Lord's portion', which in context refers, at
least partly, to Levi's close priestly position to God in the holy of
holies. The angel then goes on to say that God 'shall be to you as a
field, vineyard, fruits, silver, gold' (my translation of the Greek
version of the *Testament of Levi* 2:12; cf. also 3:1--10), almost
identical to Paul's combination of agricultural and precious metal
metaphors.

E.g., Gen. 9:7, 'And as for you, *be fruitful* \[grow\] and multiply;
populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.' Approximately 20 out
of 39 uses of the verb occur in connection with the formulaic
commission. Interestingly, 1 Chr. 17:10--12 ([LXX]{.small}) says God
'will *plant*' and cause Israel '*to grow*', and David's seed would
'*build* me \[God\] a house \[i.e., temple\]' (all three italicized
words in Greek also occurring in 1 Cor. 3:6--10).

'Building' (*oikodomē*) refers to Israel's temple (Matt. 24:1; Mark

does not use 'house' (*oikos*) anywhere else to refer to the temple,
though the word has this reference elsewhere in the OT (e.g.,
2 Sam. 7:6--7, 13) and NT (e.g., Luke 19:46; 1 Pet. 2:5); 'dwelling'
(*oikētērion*) appears only outside of 2 Corinthians in Jude without
reference to the temple, but its synonym (*katoikētērion*), used by Paul
only once, refers to the church as the temple in Eph. 2:22.

Is. 56:6 even says that Gentiles will 'minister' to the Lord in the
temple as priests, which Is. 66:18--21 makes clearer. How OT readers
could have conceived of this happening is hard to know, since Israel's
Law affirmed that only those from the tribe of Levi could serve as
priests in the temple. Possibly, the thought may have been that some
Gentiles could have been conceived of as converting to Israel's faith
and Law and joining the tribe of Levi.

So Feinberg (1971: 99), who sees here only 'that the church is presented
under the figure of a temple'. Ironically, Feinberg insists that where
the NT refers to eschatological prophecies about the temple, they must
be taken 'literally'. If he were aware that Ephesians was referring to
an eschatological prophecy about the temple, one wonders if he would
change his figurative view of Eph. 2. Perhaps he would say that Paul
does not have in mind the eschatological-prophetic element of the temple
but only wants to take the image of the temple and apply it
analogically. The problem with this is that Paul would not be paying
attention to the main contextual idea of the OT text, but neutering its
prophetic and redemptive-historical significance.

As we saw in an earlier chapter, Jesus' statement 'Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it up' (John 2:19) is probably like other
of his double entendres in the Gospel of John. On one level, he refers
to the destruction of the old temple that will be replaced by the true,
eschatological temple of his resurrection body; on another level
'destroy this temple' could well refer to Jesus himself as the emerging
new temple, who had already begun to replace the old one. If they
attempted to destroy the new temple, it would only be raised again in
the form of his resurrection body.

from 'immorality' (*porneia*): cf. 'flee from *porneia*' (1 Cor. 6:18)

The earliest source in line with the understanding that the 'man of
lawlessness' will deceptively infiltrate the church as the 'temple of
God' is the *Epistle of Barnabas* 4 (mid-nineties [AD]{.small}), which
appeals to the Dan. 7 prophecy of the end-time tyrant and associates him
with 'the works of lawlessness' and 'the age of lawlessness', and
equates the church with the temple (see also *Barnabas* 6 and 16 for the
church as the temple)! Similarly, Rev. 11 and 13 develop the same
prophecies of Dan. 7, 8, and 11 -- 12, and also equate persecuted saints
with the temple (see Beale 1999a: *in loc* on 11:1--2, 7, and on
13:1--7).

There is a theological problem of relating 2 Thess. 2:1--4 to 1 Thess.
5:1ff., the former affirming that there are signs presaging Christ's
coming and the latter saying there are no signs but that Christ's coming
will occur unexpectedly for all. Though the scope of the present
discussion does not allow further elaboration, see Beale 2003: *in loc*.
for possible resolution of the problem.

After coming to the conclusion that the 'temple of God' in 2 Thess. 2:4
is equivalent to the church, I have found that Findlay 1982: 170--174 is
apparently the first among modern commentators consulted who held the
same view, followed by, e.g., Lenski 1934: 414--415; Hamann 1953: 178;
Giblin 1967: 76--80 (though Giblin subsequently rejected this view in a
1990 article); and LaRondelle 1989: 345--354; so also Calvin 1984:
330--331; and even earlier Chrysostom and other Antiochene Fathers (on
which, see Milligan 1908: 100--101).

A further reason for the eternal existence of the new temple in the new
creation is that it will exist in the midst of God's unfettered glory,
whereas God's special presence in the old cosmos was cordoned off in a
back room of the old temple. In this respect, see Cody (1960: 81--84,
154--155), who focuses on 'God's dynamic presence' in heaven as defining
'true' but does so more in a Platonic sense.

Even the phrase 'the eternal covenant' at the end of Heb. 13:20 occurs
approximately six times in the OT to refer to the new, eternal
relationship God will have with his eschatological people at the
end-time exodus and final restoration out of sin's captivity (so
Is. 55:3; 61:8; Jer. 32:40; 50:5; Ezek. 16:60; 37:26). Perhaps the
reference in Is. 61:8 is uppermost in mind because it, like the
Is. 63:11 allusion, is part of a second exodus prophecy (see
Is. 61:1--3).

The above analysis of the 'altar' corresponds to early Christian
interpretation. In Ignatius's *Letter to the Ephesians* (5:2), 'the
place of the altar' is the authoritative unity of 'the whole church' (so
also Ignatius, *Letter to the Trallians* 7:2; cf. Ignatius, *Letter to
the Philadelphians* 4). The exhortation to maintain such unity is based
on 'the one temple \[*naos*\], even God . . . \[and\] the one altar . .
. the one Jesus Christ' to whom all should come (Ignatius, *Letter to
the Magnesians* 7:2). This altar is later equated with believers being
'stones of a temple \[*naos*\]', which is a 'temple shrine
\[*naophoroi*\]' carried by all in the church (so Ignatius, *Letter to
the Ephesians* 9; likewise, ibid. 15). Cf. also Rom. 12:1, where
believers are exhorted to offer their bodies 'as a living, holy
sacrifice, acceptable to God, \[which is\] their reasonable service of
worship'. See Beale 1999a: *in loc*. on 6:9 with regard to whether the
altar in 11:1 refers specifically to the altar of incense or the altar
of burnt offering.

See Num. 8:1--4; in Exod. 25:30--31 the lampstand is mentioned directly
after the 'bread of Presence'; likewise, 40:4; 1 Kgs. 7:48--49. We
observed in ch. 2 that Gen. 1:14--16 uses the unusual word 'lights'
(*mě'ōrōt*, 5 times) to refer to the 'sun' and 'moon', a word that is
used throughout the remainder of the Pentateuch (10 times) only for the
'lights' on the tabernacle lampstand. Among the three other uses
elsewhere in the OT, two also refer to the 'lights' of the heaven, and
the remaining use refers to God's presence (Ps. 90:8, 'the light of your
presence'). Could this suggest that the lampstand 'lights' also
symbolized the light of God's glorious presence, just as the stars were
held to reflect God's glory?

*Midrash Rabbah Numbers *15 (on Num. 8:2--3) affirms that the reward for
Israel continually lighting the seven lamps on the lampstand would be
that God would preserve their 'souls from all evil things' (15:4) and
that their blessings would 'never be abolished' (15:6). It was in the
light of these seven lamps that God's presence dwelt (15:9). The Aramaic
Bible (*Tg. Jerusalem*) of Lev. 24:2--4 directly links the dwelling of
God's glory in Israel to the continued burning of the seven lamps on the
lampstand. God's presence in the burning bush (or 'tree') at 'Sinai'
points further to the divine presence being associated with tree images;
likewise, deities were identified with trees in the ANE (so Yarden 1971:
39).

Furthermore, just as the lampstand was composed of gold (see Exod. 25),
so Judaism conceived of Eden's tree of life as gold (*2 Enoch* 8:3--4
\[J\]). And just as the seven lamps of Zech. 4 were fed oil by olive
trees, so *2 Enoch* thinks of the tree of life in the same way (*2
Enoch* 8:5 \[A\]). Philo also appears to have associated the tree of
life and the lampstand of the later temple, since he compared both with
the planetary lights (cf. *Quaest. Gen*. 1.10 with, e.g., *Quaest.
Exod*. 2.73--81). For these references to Judaism with respect to the
tree of life, see Barker 1991: 90--95

*present* experience of baptism; *Odes of Solomon* 11:16--24 refers to
those who are presently identified with the blessing of the trees of
paradise (so likewise 20:7); *Psalms of Solomon* 14:2 affirms that 'the
Lord's paradise, the trees of life, *are* his devout ones', and yet this
is also seen as a future hope in 14:10; also see Daniélou (1964:
30--35), who shows that the earliest fathers predominantly understood
the symbols of the tree of life and paradise as referring to inaugurated
realities of which Christians already partook.

'High mountain' in Ezek. 17:22--23 and 20:40 refers to the place of
Israel's endtime restoration. So also 'the mountain of the house of the

and Mic. 4:1, which will exist 'in the last days' (cf. Block 1998: 501,
who cites these texts, but nevertheless concludes that the 'high
mountain' in Ezek. 40:2 is not an eschatological but ideal reality). The
similarity of the huge end-time mountain of Dan. 2:35 to that of Ezek.
40:2 also points to the eschatological nature of the latter.

Fairbairn 1863b: 438 contends that the boundaries of Ezekiel's temple
are almost twice the size of ancient Jerusalem. The basis of Fairbairn's
calculations are not clear, and, indeed, appear to be incorrect. Ezek.
42:20 says the length and width of the temple was 'five hundred' reeds
(cf. also 42:15--19). Our calculation of the temple's size is based on
the pre-Babylonian measuring reed (which is the one relevant for
Ezekiel's time), which was approximately 6.2 cubits long: 500 reeds ×
6.2 cubits = 3,100 cubits (the Babylonian reed was 7 cubits, so that the
size of the temple would be bigger, using it as the basis of
calculation, but not nearly as large as Fairbairn's estimate). Then
3,100 cubits × 0.52 metres = 1,612 metres, which equals between one and
one and a quarter miles (based on one cubit being equal to 0.52 metres).
The Qumran *Temple Scroll* drew up a plan for a temple based also on
Ezekiel, which was about the same size as Ezekiel's temple. I am
grateful to my archaeology colleague, John Monson, who has helped me
with the calculations of Ezekiel's temple.

argument, responding to criticisms of his 'literal' view that are

argument. See Duguid 1999: 521 for negative evaluation of another
variant of a literal approach to the sacrifices. Schmitt and Laney
(1997: 118--119) also propose that, in addition to commemorative
'atonement' sacrifices, some of the offerings will be 'peace offerings'
for worship, which would not be as inconsistent with Hebrews, though
these were still part of the overall sacrificial system linked to the
old temple.

In Ezek. 41:22, the prophet sees an 'altar of wood' that is then called
'the table that is before the L[ORD]{.small}'. This is different,
however, from the table of showbread in the old temple because that one
was composed of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, and its proportions
were different. Perhaps this represents an adjusted form of that table
or it represents an adjusted altar of incense, though wooden altars
would be burned with what was burned on them (so Block 1998: 559), or it
is some other piece of furniture. The latter option is enhanced in light
of the observation, among others, of Mitchell (1980: 36), who says that
'no incense altar is mentioned' anywhere in Ezekiel's temple vision.
Also present in the gates to the inner court, though lacking in the
descriptions of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple, are tables for
slaughtering animals and for implements of slaughtering.

inhabit the broadened tabernacle over 'Jerusalem will be called holy --

A 'footstool' was also attached to Solomon's 'throne' (2 Chr. 9:18),
which likely was modelled after the notion that the ark of the covenant
was the footstool of God's heavenly throne.

Others seeing that the New Jerusalem is equivalent to the end-time
sanctuary are Caird 1966: 273, 279; Hughes 1990: 229; Walker 1996: 245;
and Duguid 1991: 483; though, unlike Woudstra, they do not see this
equivalence to be anticipated prophetically in the OT.

As noted in ch. 5 and warranting repetition here, just prior to
publication, I found that Kline (1989: 55--56, 62--63) has briefly made
the same point that the OT indicates a temple-building process beginning
in Eden that culminates in the new creation of Rev. 21, which is
equivalent to the new temple and new Jerusalem. Likewise, after writing
most of the rough draft of the book, I discovered that Dumbrell had made
the same point (2002: 53--65). In so doing, he expresses dependence
partly on my earlier commentary excursus (Beale 1999a: 1109--1111), as
well as some of the sources upon which I was originally dependent (e.g.,
Wenham 1987; 1994). Here Dumbrell actually also develops similar
thoughts from an earlier work (1985: 37--38, 41--42). Caird sees that
that the holy of holies 'has expanded . . . so that it not only fills
the whole templeless city, but embraces heaven and earth', though he
sees no precedent in the OT for such an expansion (1966: 273). Spatafora
similarly affirms that the church will be transformed into the new
Jerusalem and that 'God's presence will fill completely the Church that
will encompass the totality of the new creation' (1997: 246, 264).
Though he briefly acknowledges the cosmic aspect of temples in the OT,
he likewise does not argue for any OT precedent for the cosmic
expansion, except to say, similarly to Woudstra, that John is close to
the thought of Zech. 14:20--21, which 'announces for endtime \[*sic*\]
an enlargement \[out over the land of Israel\] of the domain of the
sacred' that was associated with the temple (Spatafora 1997: 273; so
also pp. 50--51).

See Cody 1960: 44 for a similar implication; Duguid calls the 'entire
city' that has 'become a giant Most Holy Place' a 'new world', but he
elaborates no further (1999: 483, 524). So, likewise, Congar 1962: 79,
95, 129, 200, 222, 234, 243--245, though only partly in relation to
Revelation 21 (e.g., p. 222). Congar views the universalization in
individual terms (e.g., 'every soul has become Jerusalem, a Temple of
God . . .' \[p. 79\]), as well as corporate (e.g., pp. 157--171). See
also Kline who views the new Jerusalem of Rev. 21:10ff. to be 'of cosmic
dimensions' (2001: 88).

A more radical illustration could be taking the apple from the tree,
cutting it up and making it part of a fruit salad, or making it into
apple sauce or part of some other kind of sauce. Even in these 'new
contexts' something is identifiable with the apple in its original
setting, whether by sight or taste. An illustration we would disagree
with is the taking of part of the apple and making it into something
that can no longer be identified with anything in the original apple.

The scope of the present work is unable adequately to discuss the
hermeneutical debates between the more traditional and modern positions
represented respectively: e.g., by Hirsch and Gadamer; these debates
themselves have their roots in two alternative epistemological positions
represented by Husserl and Heidegger; for discussion from Hirsch's
perspective see Hirsch 1976: e.g., 4--6; 1967: 209--274; for an
assessment from a similar perspective see Gruenler 1991: 74--86; N. T.
Wright 1992b: 18--144 (*passim*); Carson 1996: 57--137, 163--174. Both

In this regard, Hirsch's notion of a 'willed type' as a further
explanation of extended intentional, verbal meaning is abstract but is
worth trying to grasp. A 'willed type' is a meaning that has two
characteristics: (1) a categorical concept with a boundary in which some
specific ideas belong within a boundary and others are excluded, and
which can be represented by only a single idea among the other similar
ideas which belong within the legitimate boundary; (2) the categorical
concept can be represented by more than only one of the ideas belonging
to the category, as long as they fall within the boundary lines
demarcating the categorical boundary. I have paraphrased Hirsch here.
His actual twofold definition is more dense. He says a 'willed type' has
two characteristics: (1) an entity with a boundary in which some things
belong within the boundary and others are excluded, and it can be
represented by only a single instance among the other things which
belong within the legitimate boundary; (2) the type as an entity can be
represented by more than a single instance, as long as the other
representing instances fall within the boundary.

Though once the word refers to part of a description of the
eschatological temple (Ezek. 45:19), as does *skēnē* (Is. 54:2; 9:11).
Josephus uses *hieron '*for the tabernacle, for Solomon's temple, for
Zerubabbel's and for Herod's' (Schrenk, '*hieron*', *TDNT*, 3:234, 241),
though, as we saw in the first chapter, he believes the earthly temple
(*hieron*) was symbolic of various parts of the cosmos. Nevertheless, on
the basis of Schrenk's overview, he apparently never used *hieron* for
God's dwelling in heaven. Philo appears to use the word to refer to the
'whole cosmos' (*Spec. Leg.* 1.66) or the visible heavenly part of the
cosmos (i.e., the visible heavens: *Opif. Mundi* 55; *Som*. 1.215) as a
divine temple.

(cf. Rev. 21:1ff.). The fourth use refers to God and the Lamb as the

once with respect to the new creation. 'Tabernacling' (*skēnoō*) is used

Some contend that believers have progressed into the celestial holy of
holies not merely in a redemptive-historical manner (positionally in
Christ) but, in some way existentially. If so, the existential link with
the holy of holies would be through the Spirit that bridges the two.
Nevertheless, it is preferable to see the Spirit as having brought the
church into the initial phase of the end-time temple, where their
physical existence in the world is the outer court and their spiritual
existence is in the heavenly dimension of the holy place that invisibly
extends to earth.

From one perspective, saints are like the OT high priest who could enter
in and partially experience the holy of holies because he could not see
the divine luminous presence, since the incense cloud shielded it.
Otherwise, the priest would have been struck dead, since he was a sinful
human. Likewise, Christians have partially entered the heavenly holy of
holies: positionally in Jesus but not personally; otherwise they would
be annihilated because they are still sinful.

Spatafora gives partial confirmation of this idea (1997: 214): although
the 'open \[heavenly\] temple' in Revelation signifies God's greater
revelation to and his presence within the church, 'the full vision of
divine glory is denied until this age is over'; the church as a 'temple
. . . in the world' belongs to the heavenly sphere, but because it 'is
still in the world . . . union with God is not total' (1997: 300).

Before his sin, Adam's trust and obedience either maintained his perfect
relationship with God or caused him to grow in that relationship. The
latter is more probable, since he was to receive an immortal and
glorified body as a reward for his obedience, after his period of
'probation'. Presumably, part of this reward of consummation, among
other things, was a fuller experience of God's presence than he had had
earlier (for the escalated blessings Adam was to receive, see further,
Beale 1997: 49). In this respect, though Adam had not yet sinned, there
is overlap with the experience of believers, who grow in their
relationship with God.

See also 1QS 9.4--5, which is comparable to Hosea and explains that the
members of the Qumran community did not offer animal sacrifices, but
spiritual ones: 'they shall expiate guilty rebellion and sinful
infidelity and (procure) loving-kindness upon earth without the flesh of
burnt offering and the fat of sacrifice, but the offering of the lips in
accordance with the law shall be an agreeable odour of righteousness,
and perfection of way shall be as the voluntary gift of a delectable
oblation'. Qumran did this because they had rejected the Jerusalem
temple and its sacrifices as profane because of the unbelief and
apostasy of the leaders and priests of Israel, believing that they were
now the true faithful remnant of God's people.

Not coincidentally, this blessing was apparently first pronounced 'on
the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle' (Num. 7:1),
which further suggests that the blessing at that time was God's glorious
presence that dwelt in the tabernacle. This presence now blesses those
who are a part of 'the temple of God' in Christ and the Spirit.

::: {#appen12.html#niv1-1 .niv1}
"The importance of this book lies not only in the competent handling of
its chosen theme but in three other things: its evocative unpacking of
the theme of the temple and its relations to broader structures of
thought, including the kingdom of God; its modeling of the way biblical
theology is to be done; and its capacity to cause readers to perceive
fresh and wonderful things in the Scriptures, and to bow in worship and
gratitude."

**D. A. Carson**

"\[Beale's\] exegesis and theological insights will provoke \[readers\]
in their own study of the Temple."

**Missiology**, January 2006

". . . One of the finest studies in biblical theology available."

**Andrews University Seminary Studies**, Fall 2007

"I recommend this work for anyone wrestling with eschatological issues
of fulfillment or handling temple texts that are dealt with in this
book. As for me, I intend to have the book handy anytime I apporach
biblical theology as a guidebook in methodology."

**Tim Barker**, *Truth on Fire* blog, July 12, 2008

"Beale has written a comprehensive (and to my mind, convincing) biblical
theology, centering on the role of the temple both in Scripture and in
the Ancient Near East."
