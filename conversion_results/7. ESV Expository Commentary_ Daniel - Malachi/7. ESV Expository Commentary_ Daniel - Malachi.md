## PREFACE

## TO THE ESV EXPOSITORY COMMENTARY

The Bible pulsates with life, and the Spirit conveys the electrifying power of Scripture to those who lay hold of it by faith, ingest it, and live by it. God has revealed himself in the Bible, which makes the words of Scripture sweeter than honey, more precious than gold, and more valuable than all riches. These are the words of life, and the Lord has entrusted them to his church, for the sake of the world.

He has also provided the church with teachers to explain and make clear what the Word of God means and how it applies to each generation. We pray that all serious students of God's Word, both those who seek to teach others and those who pursue study for their own personal growth in godliness, will be served by the ESV Expository Commentary. Our goal has been to provide a clear, crisp, and Christ-centered explanation of the biblical text. All Scripture speaks of Christ (Luke 24:27), and we have sought to show how each biblical book helps us to see the "light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6).

To that end, each contributor has been asked to provide commentary that is:

- *exegetically sound*—self-consciously submissive to the flow of thought and lines of reasoning discernible in the biblical text;
- *robustly biblical-theological*—reading the Bible as diverse yet bearing an overarching unity, narrating a single storyline of redemption culminating in Christ;
- *globally aware*—aimed as much as possible at a global audience, in line with Crossway's mission to provide the Bible and theologically responsible resources to as many people around the world as possible;
- *broadly reformed*—standing in the historical stream of the Reformation, affirming that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, taught in Scripture alone, for God's glory alone; holding high a big God with big grace for big sinners;
- *doctrinally conversant*—fluent in theological discourse; drawing appropriate brief connections to matters of historical or current theological importance;
- *pastorally useful*—transparently and reverently "sitting under the text"; avoiding lengthy grammatical/syntactical discussions;
- *application-minded*—building brief but consistent bridges into contemporary living in both Western and non-Western contexts (being aware of the globally diverse contexts toward which these volumes are aimed);

• *efficient in expression*—economical in its use of words; not a word-byword analysis but a crisply moving exposition.

In terms of Bible translation, the ESV is the base translation used by the authors in their notes, but the authors were expected to consult the text in the original languages when doing their exposition and were not required to agree with every decision made by the ESV translators.

As civilizations crumble, God's Word stands. And we stand on it. The great truths of Scripture speak across space and time, and we aim to herald them in a way that will be globally applicable.

May God bless the study of his Word, and may he smile on this attempt to expound it.

# DANIEL

*Mitchell L. Chase*

## INTRODUCTION TO DANIEL

## *Overview*

<span id="page-19-1"></span><span id="page-19-0"></span>Slow to anger and abounding in love, God sent prophet after prophet to rebellious Israel, threatening judgment and covenant curses if his people failed to keep their obligations under the covenant made at Mount Sinai (2 Chron. 36:15–16). If the people did not repent, wrath would come. God kept his word, and Israel fell in 722 BC to the Assyrians. Judah's final demise began a little more than a century later, when the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem in 605 BC and implemented the first stage of exile by deporting youths from royal and noble Judean families. The book of Daniel is an account of the deportation and subsequent history of one such individual, Daniel, from 605 BC to his last vision in 536 BC. Most of Daniel's years were spent serving the royal court of Babylon, although he lived through the transition to Medo-Persian rule. Twelve chapters report harrowing stories of judgment and deliverance, as well as graphic prophecies of terror and hope. There are visions of beasts rising and rulers battling, and the atrocities that God's people would face. Throughout decades of exile, Daniel remained faithful to Yahweh despite external opposition and threat of death. Amid the mayhem, though, a light of hope burns bright that one day God will establish an everlasting kingdom.

## *Title and Author*

The title of the book comes from its key character, who was also the book's author. The sixth-century-BC authorship of Daniel was widely accepted by Jewish tradition and the testimony of church history. One early exception to this affirmation was Porphyry (AD 233–304), who insisted that a second-century-BC Jew wrote the book long after the events it "predicted." Many modern scholars have taken a similar view, though there are good reasons for maintaining the traditional dating.

## EVIDENCE SUPPORTING DANIEL AS THE AUTHOR

<span id="page-19-2"></span>First, the book itself clearly claims to have been written by Daniel. The author writes in the first person in the visionary portion of the book (chs. 7–12) and identifies himself as Daniel no fewer than seventeen times in these chapters.

Second, Jewish tradition ascribes the book to Daniel and understands the events described in the book to be historical. When the author of *1 Maccabees* describes

#### Dan i e l, INTRO 20

Mattathias as remembering what God had done for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (*1 Macc.* 2:59–60), Mattathias's appeal rests on the belief that the book of Daniel describes what really happened to three Jews in a fiery furnace.

Third, Jesus speaks about Daniel as a genuine historical person and prophet. During Jesus' discourse on the Mount of Olives he says, "So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel . . ." (Matt. 24:15).

<span id="page-20-2"></span>Fourth, the unity of the book suggests it had a single author, namely, Daniel. The frequent use of chiastic structures suggests a careful arrangement of the material by one mind. The move from Hebrew to Aramaic and then back to Hebrew is a fluid design strengthening the case for a single author. The intertextual connections between earlier and later portions of the book indicate an inextricable relationship between the chapters, forged by a purposeful hand.

#### ARGUMENTS CHALLENGING DANIEL AS THE AUTHOR

<span id="page-20-1"></span>Some scholars deny that the book's detailed prophecies are genuine predictions. They claim the prophecies must be post-event (*ex eventu*) compositions that merely *seem* to be forward-looking. For example, they say, since much of the final prophecy in chapter 11 relates to events in the Maccabean period (2nd century BC), the book must have been composed in that era. The problem with such a position is its anti-supernatural presupposition. If God can reveal himself, then surely he can communicate about the future, which he perfectly knows and has ordained! And if he can communicate aspects of the future, he can do so either in generalities or in detail, whichever he chooses. Insisting that Daniel's prophecies were written *ex eventu* is "not scholarship but dogmatism."1

<span id="page-20-0"></span>Second, scholars sometimes point to lexical features in the book to suggest a late (2nd-century-BC) date. The presence of some Persian and Greek loanwords seems to be the primary basis of this assertion. Yet, since Daniel lived to see the Persian conquest of Babylon, the use of Persian words in the book is not chronologically improbable. Moreover, there are only three Greek loanwords in the book, all in chapter 3, each of which describes a musical instrument. Even some critical scholars admit the use of these words is too sparse to prove anything about the date of composition.2 Regarding the book's Hebrew, W. J. Martin contends, "There is nothing about the Hebrew of Daniel that could be considered extraordinary for a bilingual or, perhaps in this case, a trilingual speaker of the language in the sixth century BC."3 Regarding its Aramaic, "On the basis of presently available evidence, the Aramaic of Daniel belongs to Official Aramaic and can have been written as early as the latter part of the sixth century B.C."4 Therefore a late date for the book cannot be established on lexical grounds.

#### CONCLUSION

If the book of Daniel was not composed by the sixth-century-BC prophet, then its historical accuracy is in question and its supposed predictions may be safely ignored. If the book's events and visions were only fancifully retrojected to a time during the Babylonian exile, then the book is nothing more than a series of manmade documents manufactured to bring (false) hope and confidence to its readers. Rightly put, "The whole theological meaning of the book depends upon Yahweh's ability to deliver his people and declare the future before it takes place."5

### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-21-3"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>Daniel was exiled to Babylon in 605 BC (1:1), and his final vision was in 536 (10:1). The book was probably completed shortly after that, for Daniel would have been in his eighties by then. During the long Babylonian exile, Daniel glimpsed the future through visions, learning that subsequent earthly empires would be followed by an everlasting kingdom not made with hands (2:34–35). What he recorded in his book would be helpful and important for his own contemporaries and for all future generations of readers as the prophecies neared fulfillment (cf. 8:26; 9:24–27; 12:4). It would be a means of God's grace for their faithfulness and perseverance.

### <span id="page-21-8"></span><span id="page-21-4"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-21-7"></span><span id="page-21-1"></span>No single literary genre covers the whole book of Daniel. The book consists of narratives (chs. 1–6) and visions (chs. 7–12). It makes use of chiasm,6 first- and third-person points of view, different languages (Hebrew and Aramaic), prophecy, dreams, and apocalyptic imagery. The narratives (except for parts of ch. 4) are conveyed in the third person, and the visions in the first person. Chapters 1 and 8–12 are written in Hebrew. Beginning in 2:4, the language switches to Aramaic through chapter 7. Dream accounts are related from both Nebuchadnezzar (e.g., ch. 2) and Daniel (e.g., ch. 7). Prophecy about the future is recorded in chapters 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Chiasms, along with other rhetorical devices, are used in both narratives and visions.

#### <span id="page-21-9"></span><span id="page-21-6"></span><span id="page-21-2"></span>*Theology of Daniel*

The book of Daniel includes at least eight theological themes.

1. *Divine sovereignty.* God foretells the future and accomplishes it. He raises up rulers and brings them down. He appoints periods of punishment, overrules the murderous intents of rulers, and delivers his people. As Nebuchadnezzar rightly recognized, God "does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, 'What have you done?'" (4:35).

<span id="page-22-15"></span><span id="page-22-12"></span><span id="page-22-7"></span><span id="page-22-4"></span>2. *Worship.* In the opening chapter, the contents of the Jerusalem temple are transported to a Babylonian temple. In chapter 3, Nebuchadnezzar sets up an image for everyone to worship. In chapter 5, Belshazzar praises his gods using vessels from the Jerusalem temple. In chapter 6, enemies of Daniel convince the king to command prayer exclusively to him. In chapters 7 and 8, two "little horn" figures act against the true worship of Yahweh. In chapter 11, true worship in Israel is interrupted by a blasphemous ruler.

<span id="page-22-25"></span><span id="page-22-19"></span><span id="page-22-0"></span>3. *Faithfulness.* Daniel and his friends display unwavering resolve to obey God (chs. 1, 3, and 6). Even when disobedience to God would mean being spared from death, they refuse to compromise.

<span id="page-22-24"></span><span id="page-22-10"></span>4. *Revelation.* God alone knows the future, and at his sovereign pleasure he may choose to disclose it, such as through dreams to Nebuchadnezzar (chs. 2 and 4). In chapter 5 God writes a message on the wall revealing imminent judgment against Babylon and Belshazzar. In four visions (chs. 7, 8, 9, and 10–12) God reveals the future directly to Daniel. God "reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him" (2:22).

<span id="page-22-13"></span><span id="page-22-6"></span><span id="page-22-3"></span>5. *Wisdom.* As Nebuchadnezzar evaluates the men trained in chapter 1, he concludes that Daniel and his friends are wiser than his Babylonian wise men (1:20). When Daniel interacts with nonbelievers, he is wise and prudent (cf. chs. 2 and 6). The queen in chapter 5 affirms Daniel's wisdom (5:11–12). During future tribulation, the wise will instruct and be refined (11:33–35). Along with the wise, who will rise from the dead and shine like the stars (12:2–3), Daniel will rise and receive his inheritance (12:13).

<span id="page-22-29"></span><span id="page-22-28"></span><span id="page-22-27"></span><span id="page-22-18"></span><span id="page-22-16"></span><span id="page-22-8"></span><span id="page-22-5"></span><span id="page-22-2"></span>6. *Judgment.* This theme can be understood in relation to earthly rulers and to God. The chief of the eunuchs fears the judgment of Nebuchadnezzar (1:10), who orders the deaths of all Babylonian wise men (2:12–13) and threatens anyone who refuses to worship his image (3:1–7). Darius of Medo-Persia makes a 30-day agreement to throw into a lions' den anyone who prays to someone other than him (6:6–9). This same king orders Daniel's accusers and their families to be killed (6:24). God displays even greater power to judge, however. He gives Judah into Nebuchadnezzar's hand (1:1–2) and humbles Nebuchadnezzar's pride (4:28–37). He writes the judgment of Babylon and Belshazzar on the palace wall (5:26–30). Visions depict God's judgment on two little horns (7:8; 8:25). The exile was God's judgment (9:1–19), and more judgment lies in store for God's people and the temple in Jerusalem (8:12–14; 9:26–27; 11:16, 28, 30–31). At the resurrection of the dead, God will judge the wicked (12:2).

<span id="page-22-26"></span><span id="page-22-23"></span><span id="page-22-22"></span><span id="page-22-21"></span><span id="page-22-20"></span><span id="page-22-17"></span><span id="page-22-14"></span><span id="page-22-11"></span><span id="page-22-9"></span><span id="page-22-1"></span>7. *Deliverance.* God delivers the four youths from death in chapter 3. When Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego go into the furnace, God preserves them so completely that not even the smell of smoke is on them (3:25–28). God delivers Nebuchadnezzar from insanity and restores his majesty (4:34–37). When Daniel is in the lions' den, God sends an angel to shut the lions' mouths (6:22–23). In Daniel's visions, God will ultimately deliver and vindicate his people (7:21–27; 8:13–14; 9:24–27; 11:35). On the day of resurrection, the righteous dead will be delivered from the dust (12:2–3).

<span id="page-23-10"></span><span id="page-23-2"></span><span id="page-23-1"></span>8. *Dominion.* John Goldingay rightly observes, "The theme that is central to Daniel as it is to no other book in the OT is the kingdom of God."7 Though Jerusalem was besieged and exiles were taken (1:1–2), God is still king of the cosmos. The dream he gives to Nebuchadnezzar in chapter 2 is a prophecy of future empires being eclipsed by an everlasting kingdom that will achieve worldwide dominion (2:31–45). Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges God's kingdom will endure from generation to generation (4:3, 34). Darius affirms the everlasting nature of this reign (6:26). Finally, Daniel's visions depict the supremacy of God's kingdom (7:14, 27; 12:1–3).

### <span id="page-23-9"></span><span id="page-23-6"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-23-13"></span><span id="page-23-8"></span><span id="page-23-3"></span>In the plotline of the Bible, the book of Daniel tells of the faithfulness of Yahweh and his people during the exile to Babylon and beyond. The book also holds forth hope for the messianic kingdom. Jesus has inaugurated the everlasting stonekingdom of chapter 2 (cf. Luke 20:18). His redemptive rescue is foreshadowed by the deliverances reported in Daniel 3 and 6. Jesus is the "one like a son of man" who comes to the Ancient of Days in chapter 7 (cf. Matt. 26:64). He receives everlasting authority in heaven and on earth (cf. Matt. 28:18). Jesus is the anointed one of Daniel 9:26 who "finishes" transgression and atones for iniquity (cf. v. 24), and is the firstfruits of all who will be raised (1 Cor. 15:20; Dan. 12:2).

#### <span id="page-23-12"></span><span id="page-23-11"></span><span id="page-23-0"></span>*Preaching from Daniel*

<span id="page-23-5"></span>Sermons from the book of Daniel should address large portions of the narratives and visions. There are ten sections in the book (chs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10–12), and each could constitute a sermon, though a detailed exploration of chapter 2 or chapters 10–12 may require more than one sermon.

<span id="page-23-15"></span>The book of Daniel should be read and heralded as a Christian book. Christian sermons should "authentically integrate the message of the text with the climax of God's revelation in the person, work, and/or teaching of Jesus Christ as revealed in the New Testament."8 The preacher may rightly discern in the book of Daniel multiple examples of faithfulness to Yahweh, from which hearers may be exhorted to obedience. This emphasis is not mere moralism. The NT recognizes the value of these examples for Christian obedience. In Hebrews 11:33–34, the writer speaks of how, by faith, there were saints who "stopped the mouths of lions" and "quenched the power of fire," which are allusions to Daniel's rescue from the lions' den (Dan. 6:22–23) and the deliverance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the fiery furnace (3:25–28). Since the examples in Hebrews 11 are intended to encourage readers to walk by faith (cf. Heb. 10:36–39), a legitimate application of those stories is to exhort God's people to endure in faith and reject compromise, while at the same time keeping our eyes firmly fixed on "Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith" (Heb. 12:2).

## *Interpretive Challenges*

<span id="page-24-2"></span>A number of challenges emerge when interpreting Daniel. First is the historical order of earthly kingdoms in the visions of chapters 2 and 7. There is disagreement as to whether the four kingdoms are Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome—which is the traditional position—or Babylon, Media, Persia, and Greece.

<span id="page-24-13"></span>Second, relating the little horn in chapter 7 to the one in chapter 8 is challenging. The descriptions of the horns are similar, leading some interpreters to equate them. If the referents of the horns are different, however, their relationship must be explained. Is one horn foreshadowing or typifying the second? Proposing historical or future fulfillment for the horns is controversial.

<span id="page-24-17"></span><span id="page-24-16"></span><span id="page-24-4"></span>Third, identifying the heavenly figures in the book of Daniel can be difficult, because they are not all given names. The figure in 8:16–17 is named Gabriel, who appears again in 9:20–21. Other heavenly figures are more ambiguous. In the fiery furnace, interpreters must weigh evidence for identifying the fourth man (who was "like a son of the gods"; 3:25) as the preincarnate Christ or an angel. The same kind of question may apply to Daniel's rescue from the lions' den in 6:22. And was the angel who spoke to Daniel in 7:16 perhaps also Gabriel (cf. 9:21)? In the final vision (10:1–12:13), the figure who appears in 10:5–6 is unnamed, leaving the interpreter to consider whether this is again Gabriel or someone else.

<span id="page-24-9"></span><span id="page-24-8"></span><span id="page-24-7"></span><span id="page-24-6"></span>Fourth, interpreters must wrestle with the relationship between Darius and Cyrus. In 5:31, "Darius the Mede received the kingdom," and chapter 6 reports an event during his reign. The end of chapter 6, though, refers to the "reign of Cyrus the Persian" (6:28). Historically, there is no evidence for a Darius who reigned before Cyrus in the Medo-Persian kingdom, so either such evidence is still forthcoming or the two names refer to the same person.

<span id="page-24-14"></span><span id="page-24-12"></span><span id="page-24-11"></span><span id="page-24-10"></span><span id="page-24-5"></span><span id="page-24-3"></span><span id="page-24-1"></span><span id="page-24-0"></span>Fifth, the book of Daniel contains many numbers to reflect upon. In chapter 1 there is a ten-day test (Dan. 1:14–15). In chapter 2 there are four parts to a metal man (2:31–35). In chapter 4 Nebuchadnezzar will be punished for "seven periods of time" (4:32). In chapter 7 Daniel has a vision of four beasts (7:1–8). The fourth beast has ten horns (v. 7), and among them arises a little horn, before which three of the other horns fall (v. 8). There is a reference to "a time, times, and half a time" (7:25), which may refer to three and a half years. In chapter 8, a ram has two horns, and a goat has one (8:3, 5–6). The sanctuary will be desolate for "2,300 evenings and mornings" (8:14). In chapter 9, Daniel learns about seventy "sevens," broken into seven, sixty-two, and one (9:24–27; cf. ESV mg. on v. 24). In chapter 10, Daniel mourns for three weeks (10:2), and the heavenly figure contends with the prince of Persia for twenty-one days (10:13). In chapter 12, Daniel hears reference to another "time, times, and half a time" (12:7). And, at the end of the book, there is a reference to 1,290 days (12:11) and 1,335 days (12:12).

<span id="page-24-23"></span><span id="page-24-22"></span><span id="page-24-21"></span><span id="page-24-20"></span><span id="page-24-19"></span><span id="page-24-18"></span><span id="page-24-15"></span>Sixth, an interpretive challenge surely exists when we come to the lengthy passage in chapter 11. The prophecy in 11:2–12:3 is the longest in the book and part of the largest unit of the book (10:1–12:13). The kings of the south and north are manifold, and historical skirmishes are plentiful. Interpreters need to consider specific historical fulfillments of this chapter because the Greek Empire, while future to Daniel, is past to us.

Seventh, there are two Greek versions of the book of Daniel: the Septuagint (LXX), also known as the Old Greek, and the version by Theodotion. The latter was widely used by the early church, although the NT also cites from the Old Greek version. These two Greek versions give insights into how Jews from antiquity understood particular passages from Daniel.

## *Outline*

<span id="page-25-3"></span><span id="page-25-2"></span><span id="page-25-1"></span>Multiple structures are common in the Bible, so it is not surprising to find multiple ways of outlining the book of Daniel. The simplest approach is to see the book in two parts: six narratives in chapters 1–6 and four visions in chapters 7–12. Another observation modifies this twofold design, however, for the Aramaic section of the book (chs. 2–7) is widely recognized as a chiasm, with chapters 2 and 7 prophesying about four kingdoms, 3 and 6 recounting rescues from death, and 4 and 5 reporting divine judgment on arrogant kings. Perhaps the whole book of Daniel is a single chiasm,9 or even two interlocking chiasms fused together by chapter 7.10 There also appears to be a three-part Hebrew chiasm in chapters 8–12: "It is with chapter 8 that chapters 10–12 have most detailed points of contact. Reminiscences of almost every verse of chapter 8 reappear here."11

<span id="page-25-5"></span><span id="page-25-4"></span><span id="page-25-0"></span>The chiasms correspond to language changes in the book. Chapter 1 is a Hebrew introduction to the book, followed by an Aramaic chiasm (chs. 2–7), leading to a Hebrew chiasm (chs. 8–12), with chapter 7 as an important transition to the visionary section of the book. The following structure is an attempt to represent the ten parts of the book of Daniel in a way that showcases the Aramaic and Hebrew features:

- I. Hebrew Introduction: Exile to Babylon (1:1–21)
- II. Aramaic Chiasm: Kingdoms, Deliverance, and Judgment (2:1–7:28)
	- A. Vision of Four Kingdoms Preceding an Eternal Kingdom (2:1–49)
		- B. Divine Deliverance from Death (3:1–30)
			- C. Judgment on Royal Arrogance (4:1–37)
			- C'. Judgment on Royal Arrogance (5:1–31)
		- B'. Divine Deliverance from Death (6:1–28)
	- A'. Vision of Four Kingdoms Preceding an Eternal Kingdom (7:1–28)
- III. Hebrew Chiasm: Kingdoms, Seventy Sevens, and the Anointed One (8:1–12:13)
	- A. Medo-Persian and Greek Kingdoms (8:1–27)
		- B. Seventy Sevens and the Anointed One (9:1–27)
	- A'. Medo-Persian and Greek Kingdoms (10:1–12:13)

## DANIEL 1:1–21

<span id="page-26-0"></span>1In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. **2**And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. **<sup>3</sup>**Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family*<sup>1</sup>* and of the nobility, **<sup>4</sup>** youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. **5**The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king. **6**Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah. **7**And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.

**<sup>8</sup>**But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself. **9**And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs, **<sup>10</sup>** and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king." **11**Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, **<sup>12</sup>** "Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. **13**Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see." **<sup>14</sup>** So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. **15**At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's food. **<sup>16</sup>** So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.

**<sup>17</sup>**As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. **18**At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. **19**And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king. **20**And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he

found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom. **21**And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-27-0"></span>When God poured the curse of exile upon Judah in 605 BC, King Nebuchadnezzar transported temple vessels and people to Babylon (1:1–2). Exiled youths faced indoctrination in Babylonian culture and literature (vv. 3–7), but Daniel resolved not to defile himself with royal food or wine. After a time of testing in which Daniel and his friends partake of only vegetables and water, Nebuchadnezzar finds them in better condition than the other youths, as well as superior in wisdom to all his magicians and enchanters (vv. 15, 18–20).

## <span id="page-27-4"></span>*Section Outline*

- <span id="page-27-1"></span>I. Hebrew Introduction: Exile to Babylon (1:1–21)

<span id="page-27-3"></span>The opening and closing verses of this section form an inclusio,12 as A and A' both name a king and a year of his reign. Both B and B' mention a time of education, the king's command, the importance of learning and skill in literature and wisdom, the chief of the eunuchs, the names of Daniel and his friends, and the event of standing before the king.

<span id="page-27-2"></span>The main drama in Daniel 1 is verses 8–16. Sections C and C' match: in the former Daniel requests not to defile himself with royal food or drink, while in the latter the steward removes the royal rations from all the youths.

three friends seem better in appearance than the other youths. In E the chief of the eunuchs speaks to Daniel, and in E' the appointed steward listens to Daniel.

The turning point of the chapter (F) is Daniel's request to eat only vegetables and water for ten days, so as to avoid defilement with the king's food and drink. He leads the steward to believe their appearance will be more pleasing than that of the other young men. The center of the chiasm highlights Daniel's faithfulness and boldness.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-28-8"></span>1:1–2 The book of Daniel begins with an ominous report: Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem in 605 BC. The king of Judah was Jehoiakim, an ungodly king who began his reign at age 25 (2 Kings 23:36–37). God was already angry with Judah "because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him" (2 Kings 23:26) and had resolved to remove Judah from his sight (v. 27).

<span id="page-28-12"></span><span id="page-28-11"></span><span id="page-28-9"></span><span id="page-28-7"></span>The words of Daniel 1:2 are unvarnished in their terror. God gave Jehoiakim over to Nebuchadnezzar. The king of Judah was now in the hands of the king of Babylon, though ultimately both were in the hands of God—Nebuchadnezzar was God's instrument of judgment (2 Kings 24:3–4). This devastation of Jerusalem was the outworking of God's plan to judge his people. Still, the city of Jerusalem and its temple were not destroyed in 605 BC. Nebuchadnezzar's actions in Daniel 1:1–2 represent only the first of three stages of Jerusalem's fall. The dates of 597 and 586 BC complete the second and third stages. From 605 to 586 BC, Judah's status seemed dark, unfathomable, chaotic, and hopeless. This judgment was an expression of God's faithfulness to the Mosaic covenant, which contained fitting curses for disobedience and idolatry, one of which was exile: "The Lord will bring you and your king whom you set over you to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known. And there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone" (Deut. 28:36–37).

<span id="page-28-6"></span><span id="page-28-4"></span>In Daniel 1:2, God's pagan rod of judgment turned against the Jerusalem temple. The spoils from Nebuchadnezzar's siege included temple vessels made during Solomon's reign (1 Kings 7). The king of Babylon transported them to the east, to the treasury of his god (Dan. 1:2). Their relocation to Babylon would play a role in chapter 5, when King Belshazzar uses them in his banquet (5:2), while their repatriation to Judah (Ezra 1:7–11) underscores an important continuity between those who returned at the time of Cyrus and their preexilic roots.

<span id="page-28-13"></span><span id="page-28-10"></span><span id="page-28-5"></span><span id="page-28-3"></span><span id="page-28-2"></span><span id="page-28-1"></span><span id="page-28-0"></span>The destination of the temple vessels was the "land of Shinar" (Dan. 1:2)—a significant way of referring to Babylon, for Shinar was mentioned in Genesis 11:2. There, rebels sought to make a name for themselves and, in their idolatry, began to build a city-temple to the heavens (vv. 3–4). Yahweh confused the language of the united idolaters, and therefore, "its name was called Babel" (v. 9), the Hebrew name for Babylon. The notion of not understanding a language is also found in the covenant curses of Deuteronomy 28, where Yahweh had threatened to "bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, swooping down like the eagle, a nation whose language you do not understand" (v. 49). <span id="page-29-2"></span><span id="page-29-0"></span>In Daniel 1, the covenant curse was coming to pass as "Babel-onians" arrived in Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar, like the rebels in Genesis 11, was interested in making a name for himself. He targeted the city, the temple, the temple's vessels, and the people of God.

<span id="page-29-4"></span><span id="page-29-3"></span>1:3–7 Nebuchadnezzar commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to evaluate Israelites using certain criteria so they could be reeducated after their deportation. The first round of deportees were "both of the royal family and of the nobility" (v. 3). By removing individuals from these groups, Nebuchadnezzar hoped to minimize resistance to his plans and increase allegiance among the populace to his Babylonian rule.

<span id="page-29-5"></span>According to verse 4, Israelites who faced deportation were to meet a high standard of physical appearance and intellectual capability. Nebuchadnezzar wanted the cream of the Israelite crop, those who might be able to serve in his royal court. These candidates had to be "youths." While Nebuchadnezzar did not specify an age, the deportees were almost certainly teenagers, perhaps as young as fourteen. The younger the subject, the longer he could serve in the royal court and the more impressionable he would be to the Babylonian worldview. Nebuchadnezzar wanted deportees to learn the literature and language of the Chaldeans—he wanted to make Babylonians out of these Jews. He wanted to reorient their worship and allegiance.

<span id="page-29-6"></span>Nebuchadnezzar's strategy of Babylonian indoctrination included a predetermined daily menu. He "assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank" (v. 5). The issue of eating and drinking is integral to the drama soon to unfold. In addition to the new location, criteria, and menu of the deportees, Nebuchadnezzar set a three-year timetable for their immersion in all things Babylonian. When that time was fulfilled, they would stand before him for evaluation (v. 18).

<span id="page-29-9"></span><span id="page-29-8"></span>Four young men among the deportees are named: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The first is the central character of the book, and the others are his friends. All four are mentioned in chapter 2; only Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah appear in chapter 3; Daniel is featured without his friends throughout the rest of the book.

<span id="page-29-11"></span><span id="page-29-10"></span><span id="page-29-7"></span><span id="page-29-1"></span>The young men were of the "tribe of Judah" (1:6). They were not just citizens of the southern kingdom but descendants of the royal tribe. In Genesis 49:10, Jacob said, "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet." Judah was the tribe from which the Messiah would come (Matt. 1:2–3; Heb. 7:14). Now Daniel and his friends were experiencing the demise of Judah. It looked as if the scepter was indeed departing from it. It seemed that a pagan king had seized the ruler's staff.

<span id="page-29-12"></span>The names Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah are each connected in some way to either the name Yahweh or the name Elohim. It is significant, then, that a *renaming* accompanied their exile. The new names—Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—were each connected to pagan deities. Nebuchadnezzar <span id="page-30-7"></span>explicitly said Daniel was "named Belteshazzar after the name of my god," Bel (Dan. 4:8). This was part of Nebuchadnezzar's strategy to make Babylonians out of the Israelite deportees, in both head and heart. The teens faced the challenge of holding fast their devotion to Yahweh in a new place, with new stories to learn and a new language to speak, with a new menu to eat and even new names to bear.

<span id="page-30-2"></span>1:8 Daniel resolved not to eat the king's food or drink his wine. This decision might seem surprising, for up to this point there has been no indication of any resistance to going into exile, receiving the syllabus for Babylonian worldview formation, or learning a new name evoking a Babylonian deity. Perhaps this issue of food and drink was the first thing Daniel could control. He believed partaking of the royal food and drink would be wrong, so he "resolved that he would not defile himself."

<span id="page-30-8"></span><span id="page-30-4"></span>How the king's food and wine would have defiled Daniel is a disputed question.13 Some suggest that the food and wine were first offered to idols, and so Daniel refused to partake because he rejected idolatry. There are, however, two problems with this answer. First, the items he requested as substitutes—vegetables and water (v. 12)—would probably have been offered to the pagan gods as well,14 and second, later in his servitude Daniel *did* eat meat and drink wine (10:2–3). Another theory is that the food was not kosher. This explanation is unlikely, though, because wine was not forbidden to Israelites. Some scholars posit more specifically that Daniel may have been abstaining from food and wine because of a Nazirite vow (cf. Numbers 6). A prior vow is possible, but the text is not clear that he made one. Another possibility is that Daniel rejected the king's menu because the food and drink would have been served using temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had taken to Babylon. Other scholars suggest that Daniel wanted to make it clear to the king that his devotion was ultimately to Yahweh. In the end, Daniel's rejection of the royal food may have been a personal resolution to maintain his devotion to Yahweh, regardless of who knew of it.

<span id="page-30-0"></span>Of these options, the most compelling is the last one. Daniel was maintaining his devotion to Yahweh, and eating and drinking the king's food and wine would have shown dependence on the king. Daniel had been given a Babylonian name, but that was not unique in Babylon. He was learning the Babylonian literature and language, but those things were part of the cultural milieu. The royal table, though, was unique, and enjoying the king's food and wine was a distinct privilege closely aligning him with the Babylonian ruler. The problem was not the food or wine itself but the fact that it was *the king's*. When the food and wine are first mentioned, they are described as "food that *the king* ate" and "wine that *he* drank" (Dan. 1:5). When Daniel wanted to avoid defilement, he would have been defiled "with *the king's* food" and "with the wine that *he* drank" (v. 8). The chief of the eunuchs reminded Daniel that "*the king*" had "assigned your food and your drink" (v. 10). When Daniel suggested a ten-day test, he referred to "*the king's* food" (v. 13). After the ten-day test was complete, Daniel and his friends "were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the *king's* food" (v. 15). Interestingly,

<span id="page-30-6"></span><span id="page-30-5"></span><span id="page-30-3"></span><span id="page-30-1"></span><sup>13</sup> Cf. a survey of options in Steinmann, *Daniel*, 99.

<span id="page-31-11"></span><span id="page-31-0"></span>once the test succeeded, "The steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables" (v. 16), and no reference is made to the items being the king's. If it is significant that this is the *only* time in chapter 1 that the food and wine are not attributed to the king, the shift was probably due to God's showing favor on Daniel and his friends during the test.

<span id="page-31-2"></span>1:9 Daniel's request was politically dangerous. Ashpenaz could have reported Daniel to the king for rebelling against royal orders, but there is a different result: "God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs." As in verse 2, God "gave," highlighting his sovereignty over Daniel's situation.

<span id="page-31-3"></span><span id="page-31-1"></span>1:10 The chief of the eunuchs was honest about his fear. Daniel had asked him to go against the king's orders, and the penalty for such rebellion could be death. Ashpenaz reasonably enough believed the effects of this different diet would be obvious when Daniel and his friends stood before Nebuchadnezzar for evaluation, and the chief of the eunuchs did not want to appear derelict in his duties.

<span id="page-31-5"></span><span id="page-31-4"></span>1:11–13 Although the chief eunuch was too fearful to help Daniel with his request, the steward he had appointed over Daniel and his three friends (v. 11) was more sympathetic. Daniel's second attempt showed the degree of his boldness and persistence. The steward could have reported Daniel's words to the king but did not. Though there is no mention of Daniel's discussing his defilement concerns with his three friends, the reader can reasonably assume they shared his resolve (cf. the resolve they themselves later exhibited; 3:16–18).

<span id="page-31-12"></span><span id="page-31-7"></span>Daniel proposed a 10-day test (1:12–13). If the steward permitted a brief season of water and vegetables, he could evaluate the four youths compared to the others and act accordingly. No reason is given for the length of ten days, although obviously the test needed to be long enough to provide a fair physical assessment.15 If Daniel and his friends appeared better (i.e., fatter) than the other youths after the test was completed, God's favor could be the only reason. Daniel was so confident of God's faithfulness during this impending test that he told the steward to "deal with your servants according to what you see" (v. 13): the steward could, if necessary, put them on the royal diet like everyone else or even deal harshly with them in some other way.

<span id="page-31-9"></span><span id="page-31-8"></span>1:14 Although the idea of God's "favor" is not repeated in this verse (cf. v. 9), that the steward "listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days" (v. 14) was evidence of God's blessing upon the young men. God had preserved them during the besieging of Jerusalem, through their exile to Babylon, through the expression of resistance to royal orders, and now through their ten-day test.

<span id="page-31-10"></span>1:15 When ten days had passed, Daniel and his three friends surpassed not just some of their fellow deportees but also "all the youths who ate the king's food."

<span id="page-31-6"></span><sup>15</sup> The use of "ten days" in verse 12 may explain why the same timespan appears in Revelation 2:10 in the letter to the church in Smyrna. The believers would be "tested . . . for ten days."

This vindication foreshadowed the fates of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah in later narratives.

<span id="page-32-0"></span>1:16 Without consulting Nebuchadnezzar, the steward made the decision to take away "their food and the wine they were to drink" and substitute vegetables. This response fulfilled Daniel's request in verse 13: "Deal with your servants according to what you see." It is also possible that the steward removed the king's food and wine from *everyone*, with "their" (v. 16) referring to "all the youths who ate the king's food" (v. 15).

<span id="page-32-8"></span><span id="page-32-7"></span><span id="page-32-6"></span><span id="page-32-3"></span><span id="page-32-2"></span>1:17–20 Once again "God gave" (cf. vv. 2, 9). He gave the four youths "learning and skill in all literature and wisdom" (v. 17), fulfilling Nebuchadnezzar's hope for the young exiles. The Babylonian program of indoctrination focused on the literature and language of the Chaldeans, as well as on being skillful in wisdom and knowledge (v. 4). God gave the four young men exactly what they needed in order to have favor with the king. Daniel received from God "understanding in all visions and dreams" (v. 17). This endowment would be integral to the following stories, for Daniel would relay and interpret royal dreams and would see visions directly from God.

<span id="page-32-10"></span><span id="page-32-9"></span>The three-year Babylonian education ended, and Nebuchadnezzar ordered that all of the exiled youths be brought before him (v. 18). He evaluated the four young men (v. 19) with tests of wisdom and understanding, and in every matter the king "found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom" (v. 20). The four surpassed not just their Babylonian schoolmates but even the Babylonian seers!

<span id="page-32-5"></span><span id="page-32-4"></span><span id="page-32-1"></span>In finding them "ten times better," Nebuchadnezzar echoes the earlier use of the number "ten" in the passage: Daniel's suggesting the test for "ten days" (v. 12), the report that the steward tested Daniel and his friends for "ten days" (v. 14), and the announcing of the end of "ten days" (v. 15). Nebuchadnezzar's estimation of the four as "ten times better" reminds the reader that God was behind their flourishing.

<span id="page-32-11"></span>1:21 Like the opening of the chapter, this final verse mentions a king and a year of his reign. While verse 1 informed the reader that Nebuchadnezzar exiled Daniel in the third year of Jehoiakim's reign (605 BC), verse 21 tells us "Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus." Cyrus the Persian conquered Babylon in 539 BC, and Daniel "was there" until that time. This probably means that Daniel served Babylonian kings in the royal court until that time. If Daniel was deported as a teenager in 605, and if the "first year of King Cyrus" (v. 21) was 539, then Daniel served the royal court into his eighties. He showed decades of faithfulness as an exiled worshiper of Yahweh.

## *Response*

The opening verses of Daniel anchor the book in history. The narration of the book's events should lead a charitable reader to believe their historicity and theological significance. In a dark and troubled period on Israel's timeline, many Israelites were exiled and their temple and city ransacked. When "all around . . . gives way," Yahweh must remain "our hope and stay."

<span id="page-33-3"></span>Our resolve to worship God matters because we too are exiles, redeemed from the slavery of sin but not yet home. A transformed creation awaits us, but for now voices all around us beckon our time, money, and allegiance. The snare of idolatry may be nearer than we imagine. The challenge is to be transformed in our minds instead of conformed to the pattern of this world (Rom. 12:2). We need a devotion to Yahweh purified by the heat of testing and suffering. Our passion for God does not exempt us from pain. The comforting bedrock of God's sovereignty implies we must be willing, for the sake of Christ, to take up our cross. Commitment to Christ is not something we should pursue only when it is convenient, politically correct, or socially acceptable. Daniel reminds us that God's people face opposition, and when they do they must endure with faith in him, believing in both his promises and his ability to keep those promises according to his sovereign will.

<span id="page-33-0"></span>The resolve of Daniel and his friends at such a young age was especially remarkable. Their allegiance to God would have been taught them by their parents. Christian parents must be mindful and purposeful in the task of training up their children in the way of the Lord (Deut. 6:4–8; Proverbs 1–9; Eph. 6:4). Away from their home and families, Daniel and his three friends walked steadfastly in righteousness. While Ashpenaz feared Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 1:10), the Jewish youths feared *God*. A true fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge (Prov. 1:7). We must pass on the faith "once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3) and seek to fortify in others a biblical worldview.

<span id="page-33-4"></span><span id="page-33-2"></span><span id="page-33-1"></span>Part of a biblical worldview is the awareness that God's people will suffer hardship. While the faith of Daniel and his friends resulted in blessing and favor before others, obedience does not mean things will always turn out well from an earthly perspective. A biblical worldview accepts that God can deliver from death or *through* death, yet obedience is called for—no matter the cost. Daniel 1 is not a chapter about dieting; it is about the courage to live out biblical conviction when compromise would be much easier. We are tempted to compromise because we are sinners, and sinners need a Savior. We are tempted by idols because our hearts are rebellious, and such idolatrous hearts need to behold an all-surpassing Treasure. Daniel believed Yahweh was better than Babylon and anything it could offer.

Daniel and his three friends, and even Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, were characters in an unfolding story that was heading somewhere, and to Someone. One day another young man who loved God with all his heart would come into history. He would be in his Father's house, teaching and amazing those who would listen. Jesus would walk in faithfulness, more so than even Daniel and his friends, and he would be wiser than anyone else who had ever lived. The work he accomplished on the cross would herald a return from deepest exile — captivity to sin and death. This one from Judah's tribe would take up the scepter and reign forever.

## DANIEL 2:1–49

<span id="page-34-0"></span>2In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him. **2**Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. **3**And the king said to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream." **4**Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic,*<sup>1</sup>* "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation." **5**The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, "The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins. **6**But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation." **<sup>7</sup>**They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation." **8**The king answered and said, "I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm— **<sup>9</sup>** if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation." **10**The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. **11**The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."

**<sup>12</sup>**Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. **<sup>13</sup>** So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them. **14**Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. **15**He declared*<sup>2</sup>* to Arioch, the king's captain, "Why is the decree of the king so urgent?" Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel. **16**And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.

**<sup>17</sup>**Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, **<sup>18</sup>** and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. **19**Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. **20**Daniel answered and said:

"Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.

- **<sup>21</sup>** He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding;
- **<sup>22</sup>** he reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.
- **<sup>23</sup>** To you, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we asked of you, for you have made known to us the king's matter."

**<sup>24</sup>**Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation."

**<sup>25</sup>**Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: "I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation." **26**The king declared to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?" **27**Daniel answered the king and said, "No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked, **28**but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: **29**To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be. **30**But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind.

**<sup>31</sup>** "You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening. **32**The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze, **<sup>33</sup>** its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. **34**As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. **35**Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

**<sup>36</sup>** "This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation. **<sup>37</sup>**You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory, **<sup>38</sup>** and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all you are the head of gold. **39**Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. **40**And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it

shall break and crush all these. **41**And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. **42**And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle. **43**As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage,*<sup>3</sup>* but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay. **44**And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever, **<sup>45</sup>** just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."

**<sup>46</sup>**Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him. **47**The king answered and said to Daniel, "Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery." **48**Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. **49**Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king's court.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-36-3"></span><span id="page-36-2"></span><span id="page-36-1"></span><span id="page-36-0"></span>King Nebuchadnezzar demands that his magicians and enchanters reveal his troubling dream and then its interpretation, but they cannot fulfill his request (2:1–11). The king decrees their deaths, which means Daniel and his friends are in danger as well (vv. 12–13). Daniel prays that God would reveal the dream (vv. 14–23), and, armed with God-given knowledge of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and its interpretation, Daniel relays them to the king (vv. 24–45). Nebuchadnezzar has dreamed of a statue made of various elements (vv. 31–35), with the different elements representing a succession of kingdoms beginning with Babylon (vv. 36–45). Nebuchadnezzar honors Daniel and promotes him and his three companions (vv. 46–49).

The chapter begins and ends with the king's responses. Nebuchadnezzar is troubled by his dream and summons Babylonian wise men (1), and later he honors and promotes Daniel for his ability to meet the royal request (1'). Sections 2 and 2' contrast the Babylonian wise men with Daniel: court magicians and enchanters cannot relay the king's dream, but Daniel does. On two occasions Daniel speaks with Arioch, the captain of the king's guard (3 and 3'), while the center of the chiasm (4) recounts Daniel's praise to God for answering his prayer.

<span id="page-37-5"></span><span id="page-37-4"></span><span id="page-37-3"></span>The structure of the chapter showcases Daniel's praise, as his themes are integral to the rest of the book. Wisdom and might belong to God (v. 20); he is sovereign over kings and kingdoms (v. 21); he reveals mysteries (v. 22); and he is worthy of thanks and praise (v. 23). This exaltation of God's sovereignty and power is important for the interpretation Daniel will relay to Nebuchadnezzar, as the succession of kingdoms will occur according to a divine timetable and toward a consummation exalting God's kingdom over all.

<span id="page-37-0"></span>Daniel 2 is part of a greater design extending through chapter 7. This section of six chapters is in Aramaic rather than Hebrew and is arranged chiastically:

Since Aramaic was the language of Babylon, the switch from Hebrew to Aramaic at 2:4 may symbolize exile in a foreign land, while the return to Hebrew at 8:1 may represent the promise of return from exile.16 The change in languages may also be a structural device creating interlocking chiasms.17

## *Comment*

<span id="page-37-1"></span>2:1 Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon, and the following events occurred in his "second year." This year may seem out of chronological order, for at the end of the previous chapter Daniel and his friends had already completed three years

of training and education. According to the Babylonian system, however, a king's partial accession year was not counted among the years of his reign.18 The "second year" thus refers to two years after the accession year. Nebuchadnezzar's second year spanned from Nisan 1, 603 BC, to the end of Adar 602 (March 22, 603–April 9, 602).

<span id="page-38-1"></span>Shortly after the four Judean teens completed their Babylonian education (1:18–19), during his second regnal year in Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar "had dreams," with a twofold effect: "his spirit was troubled" and "his sleep left him." He was unsettled by what he saw and did not understand its meaning. This would be especially frustrating for a king who thought that perhaps the gods were revealing something to him about the future of his kingdom.

<span id="page-38-2"></span>2:2 The king may have waited until daytime to summon his experts, but since verse 1 reports that "his sleep left him," his summons may have occurred at night. His wise men consisted of "the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers," with "the Chaldeans" encompassing all of them. He commanded them to "tell . . . his dreams."

<span id="page-38-6"></span><span id="page-38-4"></span><span id="page-38-3"></span>2:3–4 Nebuchadnezzar disclosed that he had a dream, whose possible interpretations troubled him (v. 3). The wise men in his court spoke to him in Aramaic (v. 4), and from that point through chapter 7, the book of Daniel switches from Hebrew to Aramaic. The men spoke typical ancient Near Eastern words of deference ("O king, live forever!"), perhaps reflecting a prayer servants prayed on behalf of their ruler. Their next statement parsed the situation carefully: first Nebuchadnezzar should tell them the dream, and then they would interpret it (v. 4).

<span id="page-38-7"></span><span id="page-38-5"></span>2:5–6 Nebuchadnezzar rejected the terms of the wise men. He wanted them to recount both the dream *and* the interpretation. Only then could he find them trustworthy. If they failed to meet his demand, they and their households would be destroyed, but if they met his demand, Nebuchadnezzar promised "gifts and rewards and great honor."

<span id="page-38-8"></span>2:7 Despite the threat to their lives, the wise men again asked to be told the dream's content (cf. v. 4). At this point, it is evident they will not meet the king's demand. Indeed, they *cannot*. Inventing the interpretation would not necessarily have exposed them as liars, but any attempt to describe the king's dream would instantly discredit them. The king was not one to make idle threats (cf. his treatment of Zedekiah in 2 Kings 25:6–7). Their only hope was that Nebuchadnezzar would change his mind and disclose his dream.

<span id="page-38-9"></span><span id="page-38-0"></span>2:8–9 Nebuchadnezzar accused the wise men of trying to "gain time" out of fear of his "firm" word of judgment. He also accused them of agreeing to "speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change." This changing of the times probably refers to the transition of rulers or even kingdoms, for Nebuchadnezzar certainly would *not* live forever (cf. v. 4).

<span id="page-39-13"></span><span id="page-39-10"></span><span id="page-39-9"></span>2:10–11 In view of Nebuchadnezzar's troubled spirit (vv. 1, 3), warnings of destruction (v. 5, 9a), and accusations of flattery (v. 9b), the wise men declared the impossibility of what he demanded. Note the comprehensive phrases: "There is not a man on earth," "no great and powerful king has asked such a thing," ". . . any magician or enchanter or Chaldean" (v. 10). They not only admitted their inability to describe the king's dream; they also claimed his demand was unprecedented.

<span id="page-39-12"></span><span id="page-39-4"></span>Did Nebuchadnezzar himself think such a request was reasonable? Perhaps his encounter with Daniel, who had "understanding in all visions and dreams" (1:17), and who along with his three friends was "better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all [the] kingdom" (v. 20), had given Nebuchadnezzar unrealistic expectations of his own band of astrologers and magicians.

<span id="page-39-14"></span><span id="page-39-6"></span><span id="page-39-0"></span>After 2:11, the wise men fall silent, making their final words in this verse significant and ironic: ". . . the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh." The notion of gods dwelling with mortals may have seemed inconceivable in Babylonian lore, but the stories in Israel's history painted a much different picture. From the beginning of Israel's Scriptures, Yahweh was a God who dwelled with his people. He was in the garden of Eden with Adam and Eve (Gen. 2:15–25; 3:8), his glory filled the tabernacle the Israelites carried to the Promised Land (Ex. 40:34–38), and he indwelled the temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 8:1–11). The story of the world's true Lord is that of a God who dwells with flesh. In the outworking of God's redemptive plan, one day the Word himself would not only *dwell* with flesh but *become* flesh (John 1:14).

<span id="page-39-20"></span><span id="page-39-16"></span><span id="page-39-11"></span><span id="page-39-2"></span><span id="page-39-1"></span>2:12–13 The inability of the king's wise men did not alter Nebuchadnezzar's threat, nor did their admission of their inability quell his anger. Full of fury, and in fulfillment of verses 5 and 9, Nebuchadnezzar "commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed" (v. 12). This decree of death extended to *all* the wise men of Babylon, including Daniel and his companions (v. 13).

<span id="page-39-18"></span><span id="page-39-17"></span><span id="page-39-15"></span><span id="page-39-3"></span>2:14–15 With the decree of destruction hanging over him, Daniel proceeded "with prudence and discretion." We saw this attitude in chapter 1, when Daniel interacted with Ashpenaz and the steward (1:8–13). Now, Daniel spoke with Arioch, "captain of the king's guard." Arioch "had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon," so speaking with him could have posed a danger, even though Daniel believed Arioch was the right man to answer his question: "Why is the decree of the king so urgent?"

<span id="page-39-8"></span>Daniel's question revealed that he was unaware of what had taken place between Nebuchadnezzar and his cohort. Though Daniel had completed three years of training, he had not become a sorcerer, magician, or enchanter (cf. 2:2); such positions would have compromised his devotion to Yahweh. He would serve the king when summoned (1:19; 2:2), but he had not spoken with Nebuchadnezzar about the recent dream (2:1).

<span id="page-39-19"></span><span id="page-39-7"></span><span id="page-39-5"></span>2:16 Daniel went into the presence of the king and requested an appointment. How he gained access is not reported, but the reason for his request is not surprising:

"that he might show the interpretation to the king." This was an act of faith, for Daniel did not even have knowledge of the dream. Apparently he was persuasive, because he left the palace alive.

<span id="page-40-4"></span><span id="page-40-2"></span>2:17–18 After meeting with the king about an appointed time to give the dream's interpretation (cf. v. 16), Daniel returned to his house and "made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions." If the three friends were at the house already, this may indicate that the four shared a home together. Or perhaps when the decree of destruction went out (vv. 12–13), Daniel and his companions gathered together in his home.

<span id="page-40-3"></span>Daniel told his friends to "seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery," so that they might not be killed with "the rest of the wise men of Babylon." Daniel hoped for deliverance from Nebuchadnezzar's rage, and God, as the God "of heaven," was the only one who could help them in this earthly predicament.

<span id="page-40-12"></span><span id="page-40-6"></span>2:19 God answered Daniel and his friends' prayer. Daniel received his vision "at night," just as Nebuchadnezzar's dream had come (v. 1). It is not clear whether Daniel was asleep or awake, as God gives visions during both states (cf. 7:1; 9:20–23); possibly Daniel and his friends remained fervent in prayer until God granted understanding.

<span id="page-40-13"></span><span id="page-40-7"></span><span id="page-40-5"></span><span id="page-40-1"></span>Daniel responded to God's answer with words of exaltation (2:19–23). "God of heaven" (cf. v. 18) is the transcendent Creator who has shown favor to Daniel and his friends. God's power and wisdom are not restricted to the boundaries of the Promised Land; with global jurisdiction, God is involved in the affairs of his people wherever they find themselves. "God of heaven" recalls Genesis 24:7, where Abraham remembered how Yahweh, "the God of heaven," took him "from my father's house and from the land of my kindred."19 This connects faithful Daniel to the foremost patriarch. Daniel trusted in the God of Abraham, who had once again removed a man from his father's house and homeland, this time through exile. God took Abraham *to* the Promised Land, but he took Daniel *from* it. If God were only the God of Jerusalem, Daniel would have no hope. But God is the God *of heaven*, and so to him Daniel prayed, offering thanks and praise.

<span id="page-40-11"></span><span id="page-40-10"></span><span id="page-40-9"></span><span id="page-40-8"></span>2:20–23 Daniel transitioned from petition to praise. To God belong "wisdom and might" (v. 20)—the true and living God knows the future and brings to pass what he has planned. Verses 21–22 illustrate God's "wisdom and might," although in reverse order—verse 21a concerning his might and verses 21b–22 his wisdom. God's might is seen in that "he changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings" (v. 21). The second phrase interprets the first: the transition of rulers and kingdoms is what Daniel meant by "times and seasons." God is sovereign over all powers and authorities on earth—even Nebuchadnezzar—and is not limited only to those who worship him. He determines *who* is in power and *when*.

<span id="page-40-0"></span><sup>19</sup> In the Pentateuch, the title "God of heaven" occurs only in Genesis 24:3 and 24:7. The first reference has a longer version, "the God of heaven and God of the earth," while the second reference has only "the God of heaven."

<span id="page-41-9"></span>Daniel also praised God because "he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding; he reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him" (vv. 21b–22). God gave Daniel wisdom and knowledge regarding the king's dream and its interpretation—Daniel needed to know "the mystery" (v. 19), so God revealed the "deep and hidden things" by taking "what is in the darkness" and making it known.

<span id="page-41-10"></span><span id="page-41-8"></span><span id="page-41-7"></span>The final verse of Daniel's blessing to God (v. 23) pulls together the elements of verses 20–22. He calls Yahweh "O God of my fathers," indicating continuity with his faithful ancestors, especially the patriarchs—the "God of heaven" was the "God of my fathers" (vv. 19, 23). To him Daniel offered "thanks and praise," words unpacking what he meant by "Blessed be the name of God" (v. 20). Daniel explained explicitly why he praised the God of heaven: "You have . . . made known to me what we asked of you" (v. 23). The plural ("what *we* asked") confirms that Daniel's friends also sought God's mercy through prayer (vv. 17–18).

<span id="page-41-6"></span><span id="page-41-2"></span>The doxology is not only the structural center in chapter 2 (cf. Section Outline above) but also its theological center, and, in fact, God's sovereignty and wisdom surge like mighty rivers throughout the whole book and figure in other biblical doxologies that praise his might and wisdom (cf. 1 Chron. 29:11; Rom. 11:33–36).

<span id="page-41-11"></span><span id="page-41-4"></span><span id="page-41-0"></span>2:24 Ready to disclose his life-saving knowledge, "Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon." This is their second encounter in this chapter (cf. v. 15). Earlier, Daniel had gone before the king directly (v. 16), but the reason for now going to Arioch is suggested in his opening words: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon" (v. 24). Daniel perhaps feared that, if he went to Nebuchadnezzar first, the king would not get word out to Arioch in time to spare the Babylonian wise men from death. Since the remainder of chapter 2 does not report the destruction of the wise men, it is reasonable to assume that Daniel's success resulted in everyone's survival.

<span id="page-41-12"></span>2:25 The harshness and urgency of the king's decree warranted haste. Arioch rushed Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar's presence and announced the breaking news: "I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation." Arioch's claim may have overstated his own role in the situation, for it was not Arioch who discovered Daniel but Daniel who sought Arioch. Calling Daniel "a man" was especially ironic, since earlier the king's wise men insisted that no one "except the gods" could grant the king's request (v. 11).

<span id="page-41-14"></span><span id="page-41-13"></span><span id="page-41-3"></span><span id="page-41-1"></span>2:26 We are reminded that Daniel was also known as Belteshazzar, the name the chief of the eunuchs had given him (1:7) because the king had chosen it (5:12) in honor of his own god (4:8). Nebuchadnezzar calls Daniel that name in a later story (4:9, 18).

<span id="page-41-15"></span><span id="page-41-5"></span>Daniel had previously gone to Nebuchadnezzar to request an appointment, "that he might show the interpretation to the king" (2:16). Now Daniel has returned, so the king's question is appropriate: "Are you able to make known to <span id="page-42-1"></span>me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?" Nebuchadnezzar had made the same request of the Babylonian wise men, who had failed him (vv. 10–11). The king did not lower his expectation at this juncture.

<span id="page-42-5"></span><span id="page-42-4"></span><span id="page-42-3"></span>2:27–29 Daniel spoke to Nebuchadnezzar at length (vv. 27–45). First he asserted that God had revealed the mystery to him (vv. 27–30); then he told the king the dream (vv. 31–35) and interpreted it (vv. 36–45).

<span id="page-42-15"></span><span id="page-42-2"></span>Daniel began by reminding the king that none of his wise men fulfilled what he had asked (v. 27). In contrast to human inability, however, "There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries"; this God had "made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days"; and Daniel was ready to recount it to the king (v. 28). "Latter days" indicated that Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed of future events pertaining to kingdoms beyond Babylon (cf. vv. 37–45).

<span id="page-42-16"></span><span id="page-42-8"></span><span id="page-42-6"></span>Verse 29 has the same general content as verse 28, only reversed. In verse 28 Daniel spoke about both a God "who reveals mysteries" and the fact that the king had the visions in bed. In verse 29 Daniel said the vision came while the king was in bed and then characterized God as "he who reveals mysteries." The notion of the "latter days" in verse 28 is repackaged with the phrases "what would be after this" and "what is to be" in verse 29. The semantic and conceptual connections in verses 28 and 29 reinforce that the God of heaven has done what mere man cannot do: reveal details concerning the future (cf. Rev. 1:19).

<span id="page-42-17"></span><span id="page-42-9"></span><span id="page-42-7"></span>2:30 After saying that God had revealed the future to Nebuchadnezzar (vv. 2:28– 29), Daniel now claimed to know this mystery, as well as a divinely revealed interpretation of it, "that you may know the thoughts of your mind." Daniel knew the dream "not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living," an admission that may have surprised Nebuchadnezzar, for he had evaluated Daniel very highly at the end of his three-year education (1:19–20). As Daniel now prepared to tell the dream and its interpretation, he did not seize the opportunity for self-exaltation.

<span id="page-42-11"></span><span id="page-42-10"></span><span id="page-42-0"></span>2:31–35 Daniel made a general statement about the dream: "You saw, O king, . . . a great image." This image is the subject of the rest of Daniel's monologue. It was "mighty and of exceeding brightness," and "its appearance was frightening" (v. 31). This intimidating image was a man composed of several metals, and Daniel began at the top of the image as he described it: a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, middle and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet partly of iron and partly of clay (vv. 32–33). The body parts can be distilled into four sections, with their corresponding elements (table 1.1).

<span id="page-42-14"></span><span id="page-42-13"></span><span id="page-42-12"></span>Then Daniel related what happened to the image: a stone, "cut out by no human hand," struck the image on the feet and broke them (v. 34). The whole statue was affected, for "the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces" (v. 35a). The list of metals is now in reverse order, ascending from feet to head. The shattering was so thorough that the pieces "became

<span id="page-43-3"></span><span id="page-43-2"></span><span id="page-43-1"></span>like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found" (v. 35b)—an image of divine judgment (cf. Ps. 1:4). No part of the image could endure the stone, which "became a great mountain and filled the whole earth" (Dan. 2:35c). This worldwide dominion was something ascribed to no other metal or body part—the metals were all vulnerable, but the stone was invincible.

TABLE 1.1: Body Parts of the Daniel 2 Image

| Body Part(s):     | Made of:      |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Head              | Gold          |
| Chest and Arms    | Silver        |
| Middle and Thighs | Bronze        |
| Legs and Feet     | Iron and Clay |

<span id="page-43-4"></span>2:36 With the words "This was the dream," Daniel signaled that the time had now come for the interpretation. Since the king had not questioned any detail of the retelling, Daniel had succeeded in part one of his task.

<span id="page-43-5"></span>2:37–38 Daniel spoke to Nebuchadnezzar in honorific ways: "O king," "king of kings," who possessed "the kingdom, the power, the might, and the glory." Daniel acknowledged that Babylon was strong and imposing, formidable to those who looked on, yet he gave even greater honor where it was due, referring to the king as the one "to whom the God of heaven has given" and "into whose hand he has given" these things. Nebuchadnezzar held power over a vast and strong kingdom only by God's sovereign plan. Into Nebuchadnezzar's "hand," God gave "the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all." This "God of heaven" ruled the rulers.

<span id="page-43-0"></span>The language of verse 38 recalls the sixth day of creation: "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth" (Gen. 1:26). As an image-bearer of God, Nebuchadnezzar was a kind of Adam, charged with the creation mandate—even though he would not be a faithful image-bearer, exercising dominion for his own glory and exaltation (cf. Dan. 3:1–7).

<span id="page-43-8"></span><span id="page-43-6"></span>At the end of 2:38, Nebuchadnezzar received the first identification of a metal from the image in his dream: "You are the head of gold." The head of gold represented the Babylonian kingdom corporately and Nebuchadnezzar in particular.

<span id="page-43-7"></span>2:39a Because of the clarity of Daniel's interpretation, the gold head is the least debated element of the image. The next words, however, divide scholars, as Daniel moves from the present to the future: "Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you."

<span id="page-44-1"></span>This second kingdom (the silver chest and arms; v. 32) refers either to only the Medes or to the Medes and Persians together.20 Our decision on this issue will affect our interpretation of the rest of the image, as the kingdoms in view are successive. If the silver chest and arms is the Median kingdom only, then the third kingdom (v. 39b) is Persia, but if the second kingdom is understood as the Medo-Persian Empire, then the third is most likely Greece. Because upcoming visions in the book of Daniel will incorporate multiple kingdoms that correspond to those in chapter 2, the decision made here will affect the interpretation of later portions of the book.

<span id="page-44-0"></span>"Another kingdom inferior to you" probably refers to the Medo-Persian (or simply Persian) kingdom. It conquered Babylon in 539 BC and remained in power until 331 BC. A progression from Babylon to Persia in Nebuchadnezzar's vision is reasonable because Babylon fell not to the Medes but to the Persians, eleven years after the Persians had absorbed the Median Empire (c. 550 BC). Nevertheless, the Medes continued to play an important role in the Persian Empire, and the Greeks frequently referred to Persians as "Medes," until the fourth century BC.

<span id="page-44-3"></span>2:39b Daniel continued his interpretation with the next element: "a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth." In 331 BC, the Medo-Persians fell to the Greeks, headed by Alexander the Great. The comprehensive description of an empire to "rule over all the earth" denotes the vast reach and greatness of the Greek kingdom, which reigned until 146 BC.

<span id="page-44-5"></span><span id="page-44-4"></span><span id="page-44-2"></span>2:40–43 After the Greeks came the Romans.21 Rome was the fourth kingdom in the king's vision and received the most detail: it would be "strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these" (v. 40). The description is of a triumphant empire, seemingly undefeatable, obliterating its opponents with the strength of iron. Yet Rome was not invincible: "As you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay" (v. 41). The legs were of iron (v. 33) but rested on feet of iron and clay. This mixture denotes division, and division means vulnerability: "As the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle" (v. 42). Daniel sees that "they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay" (v. 43). The meaning of "mix with one another in marriage" is unclear, but seems to refer to intermarriage between ethnicities, perhaps specifically royal intermarriages, creating instability in the empire.

<span id="page-44-7"></span><span id="page-44-6"></span>Table 1.2 distills the sections of the image, their corresponding metals, and the kingdoms they represent.

<sup>20</sup> Some scholars believe, however, that the number four represents completeness and that, rather than referring to specific historical empires, the four-part statue provides a global perspective on world history. 21 Christian fathers like Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Origen, and Eusebius identified the four kingdoms as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, so there is precedent early in church history for the interpretation argued above.

| Body Part(s):  | Made of:      | Kingdom:    |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Head           | Gold          | Babylon     |

<span id="page-45-1"></span>TABLE 1.2: Kingdoms Represented by the Daniel 2 Image

<span id="page-45-7"></span><span id="page-45-2"></span>2:44–45 "The days of those kings" refers to the fourth empire (Rome), which saw a succession of kings (emperors) for several centuries.22 In contrast to the four kingdoms of verses 31–43, which all proved to be temporary, God's kingdom "shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever" (v. 44). God's kingdom shall prevail, "just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold" (v. 45).

<span id="page-45-8"></span><span id="page-45-6"></span><span id="page-45-3"></span>Note that the rock/mountain was not a part of the four-part image. The Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek, and Roman kingdoms were purely of this world, while the "stone was cut out by no human hand" (v. 34). It was heavenly in origin and eternal in duration (v. 44), representing a fifth kingdom superior to the previous four.

<span id="page-45-9"></span><span id="page-45-5"></span>Jesus reimagined this stone/mountain metaphor when he spoke of God's kingdom as "a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches" (Matt. 13:31–32). God's kingdom starts small and grows, much like the stone that became a great mountain and filled the earth (Dan. 2:35). The prominence of God's rule is depicted similarly in Isaiah: "It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it" (Isa. 2:2).

<span id="page-45-0"></span>Jesus identified himself as the "stone" from Daniel's interpretation in a parable about wicked tenants. In Luke 20:17, he cited Psalm 118:22 ("The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"; cf. Isa. 8:14; 28:16) and then said, "Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him" (Luke 20:18), alluding to Daniel 2:34–35, 44–45.

<span id="page-45-4"></span>Having completed the interpretation, Daniel reminded Nebuchadnezzar, "A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this" (v. 45). And because the God of heaven made all of this known, "The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."

<sup>22</sup> Steinmann rightly warns that if the fourth kingdom were interpreted to be Greece, "Daniel's prophecy would be false prophecy, not to be honored or believed" (*Daniel*, 137), for God's kingdom (represented by the crushing rock) was established not during the Greek Empire but during the Roman.

<span id="page-46-6"></span><span id="page-46-5"></span>2:46–48 Nebuchadnezzar responded to Daniel's recounting of his dream and its interpretation. First he "fell upon his face"—perhaps because he was grateful or overwhelmed or fearful—"and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him" (v. 46). Nebuchadnezzar intended to honor Daniel with the offering and incense, not to worship him. He may have spoken other words to Daniel, but all that is recorded is his marveling at the greatness of Daniel's God. Although the titles "God of gods" and "Lord of kings" (v. 47) denote prominence and superiority, the nature of this confession must not be pressed too far. Nebuchadnezzar was duly impressed with what Daniel did, and more so with what Daniel's God could do, but this was not yet an embrace of monotheism.

<span id="page-46-9"></span><span id="page-46-8"></span><span id="page-46-7"></span>The final response to Daniel's interpretation involved high honors and promotion (v. 48a). His "gifts" probably consisted of material rewards, and in addition to granting these, the king also "made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon" (v. 48b). He was now chief adviser to the king! Earlier in the chapter, Daniel's life was in danger (v. 13). Now, he not only was spared from death but also had ascended in rank under Nebuchadnezzar's authority. Daniel had prospered under God's favor.

<span id="page-46-11"></span><span id="page-46-1"></span>2:49 From his new position, Daniel made a request for the sake of his friends. The king "appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon," while "Daniel remained at the king's court." Like Daniel, his companions had once been under a royal decree of death (v. 13), but now they have ascended to a new rank. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego became overseers in the province, which probably implied managerial duties over the citizenry. The first chapter ended with the king granting Daniel and his three friends a standing in his court (1:19, 21), and the second chapter ends with even greater positions (2:48–49). This pattern of faithfulness resulting in blessing or promotion will be repeated in chapters 3, 5, and 6.

<span id="page-46-12"></span><span id="page-46-10"></span><span id="page-46-0"></span>The cycle of Daniel's life thus far (being taken to a foreign country, remaining faithful to Yahweh, becoming an adviser to a pagan ruler, interpreting a ruler's dreams, being promoted within the kingdom) is reminiscent of Joseph's. As God did not abandon Joseph, he has not abandoned Daniel. Rather, God is with Daniel and his people in Babylonian captivity. Further, the Egyptian captivity ended with an exodus when God later raised up a deliverer. Daniel, a new Joseph, is in Babylonian captivity, and another exodus is perhaps in store.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-46-4"></span><span id="page-46-3"></span><span id="page-46-2"></span>The God of the Bible is the Lord of history and ruler over all authorities. Believers should eagerly affirm Daniel's words of praise: "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belongs wisdom and might" (2:20), for God appoints all rulers (v. 21), while he alone possesses "deep and hidden things," which he may make known (vv. 22–23). We should be humble before this wise and sovereign God. Like Nebuchadnezzar, who "fell upon his face" before Daniel (v. 46), a bowed heart

should be the worshiper's posture before God. God's kingdom shall stand forever, so he alone is worthy of worship and exaltation.

More than merely predicting the future, God ordains what is to come. He is able to make known to Daniel the coming kingdoms because he has purposed the times and sequence of their arrival. According to God's redemptive plan, during the reign of the fourth kingdom (the Roman Empire) he would inaugurate an eternal kingdom through the stone, which we learn in the NT is Jesus Christ. The coming of Jesus is the greatest revelation God has ever made. Although the Babylonian wise men claimed that "the gods['] . . . dwelling is not with flesh" (v. 11), the modern-day reader of Daniel now knows that the true and living God, who dwelt with Israel in the OT, tabernacled with mankind in the most profound and intimate way when "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14).

<span id="page-47-8"></span><span id="page-47-4"></span><span id="page-47-3"></span><span id="page-47-2"></span>Six hundred years passed between the Babylonian head of gold (Dan. 2:32) and the stone "cut out by no human hand" (v. 34). Through every century, God's hand has guided the events of history and the powers in charge. He has bestowed political might according to his sovereign purpose (vv. 37–38) and has removed kings and set up new ones at his pleasure. As Isaiah said,

<span id="page-47-5"></span>

| they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness." |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                |
|                                                                |

<span id="page-47-6"></span><span id="page-47-0"></span>The God of heaven and earth transcends all he has made, yet he dwells with man. The original readers of the book of Daniel were to trust in this God and remain faithful to him. Although the Medo-Persians (the second kingdom; Dan. 2:32) were ruling when Daniel finished his book, two other kingdoms were still to come (vv. 39–43). The devotion of God's people would be tested and tried under future kingdoms and rulers, but the God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries (v. 47) was constant and sure and could deliver his people from death and even through it.

<span id="page-47-7"></span><span id="page-47-1"></span>Nebuchadnezzar may have been impressed by the ability of Daniel's God when compared to the silent deities of the Babylonian wise men (vv. 10–11, 47), but Isaiah asks the right questions in view of God's comprehensive control across every moment of time—past, present, and future:

 To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him? . . . Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,

the Creator of the ends of the earth.

 He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength." (Isa. 40:18, 28–29)

<span id="page-48-2"></span><span id="page-48-1"></span><span id="page-48-0"></span>Believers must do what Daniel and his friends did, no matter the trial or ruler or century: plead for his wisdom, trust his timing, depend on his strength, and remain faithful. Persecution and death, rather than promotion, may come. Still, Yahweh is the everlasting God, and he has all the strength the weary soul will need. By grace, the believer will affirm the words of Paul: "to live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Phil. 1:21).

## DANIEL 3:1–30

3 King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits*<sup>1</sup>* and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. **2**Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. **<sup>3</sup>**Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. **4**And the herald proclaimed aloud, "You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, **<sup>5</sup>** that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. **<sup>6</sup>**And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace." **7**Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

**<sup>8</sup>**Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews. **9**They declared*<sup>2</sup>* to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever! **10**You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image. **11**And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace. **<sup>12</sup>**There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."

**<sup>13</sup>**Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king. **14**Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up? **15**Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good.*<sup>3</sup>* But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?"

**<sup>16</sup>** Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. **<sup>17</sup>** If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.*<sup>4</sup>* **<sup>18</sup>**But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."

**<sup>19</sup>**Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated. **20**And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. **21**Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics,*<sup>5</sup>* their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace. **<sup>22</sup>**Because the king's order was urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. **23**And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.

**<sup>24</sup>**Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He declared to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?" They answered and said to the king, "True, O king." **25**He answered and said, "But I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods."

**<sup>26</sup>**Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire. **27**And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them. **28**Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside*<sup>6</sup>* the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. **29**Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way." **30**Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

<span id="page-50-11"></span><span id="page-50-8"></span><span id="page-50-7"></span><span id="page-50-6"></span><span id="page-50-2"></span>After dreaming about an image (2:31–45), Nebuchadnezzar *constructs* an image and commands everyone to worship it (3:1–5). Defiance would mean swift destruction in a fiery furnace (v. 6). Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to worship the image (vv. 8–12) and declare their confidence in God (vv. 13–18). When the king has them thrown into the fiery furnace, God delivers them (vv. 19–27). Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges this divine deliverance and warns that anyone who speaks against the God of these Jewish men will be destroyed (vv. 28–29). Having escaped fiery death, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are promoted (v. 30).

II.B. Divine Deliverance from Death (3:1–30)

- 1. The Herald Proclaims a Royal Decree (3:1–7)

		- 3. Nebuchadnezzar Is Enraged and Gives Orders (3:13–15)

- <span id="page-50-4"></span>1'. Nebuchadnezzar Proclaims a Royal Decree (3:28–30)

Daniel 3 is framed by different commands (1 and 1'). In the first, the king's herald announces the obligation to worship the image, and in the second the king decrees that anyone who speaks against God will be destroyed. The main drama of the story occurs in verses 8–27, where Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are accused of defying the king (2) but are delivered from the fiery furnace without harm (2').

<span id="page-50-9"></span><span id="page-50-1"></span>In the penultimate sections of the chiasm (3 and 3'), Nebuchadnezzar gives commands. When he hears that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to worship the golden image, he commands that they be brought to him and he questions their allegiance (3). Part of this section includes the warning about death in the fiery furnace. Then, in 3', Nebuchadnezzar orders the furnace to be made hotter than usual and the three young men to be cast in.

<span id="page-50-10"></span>Central to the story of chapter 3 is the resolve of three young men. In verses 16–18 they declare their trust in God to deliver them but also their intent to be faithful to him even if he chooses not to spare them from death.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-50-5"></span><span id="page-50-3"></span><span id="page-50-0"></span>3:1 As in chapters 1–2, King Nebuchadnezzar is a major character in chapter 3. The opening of this chapter is connected conceptually to the dream in chapter 2. Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed of an image made of different metals, including a "head of gold" (2:38) representing his own kingdom. But when he "made an image of gold" (3:1), he was communicating that the whole image—not just the head—should be gold. No silver, bronze, iron, or iron/clay were included in his statue. From head to toe, the golden statue symbolized the king's hubris and defiance of what the God of heaven had revealed to Daniel. It is as if the king thought he could stop the vision from coming true.

<span id="page-51-4"></span><span id="page-51-2"></span>The image was large—its "height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits" (3:1), or 90 feet/27.4 meters high (as tall as a 10-story building) and 9 feet/2.7 meters wide. This great size matched Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which was of a "mighty" image (2:31). The king "set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon" (3:1)—the image was thus not in the heart of the city but right outside it; people would have had to travel a greater distance to reach it, yet its location on a plain ensured that many could gather before it.

<span id="page-51-7"></span>3:2–3 Nebuchadnezzar summoned all the important people of Babylon for the dedication of the image. Eight groups—probably listed in order from most to least important—stood before the image; included among the "officials of the provinces" would have been Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (cf. 2:49).

<span id="page-51-10"></span><span id="page-51-9"></span><span id="page-51-5"></span>3:4–6 A herald issued a decree for the "peoples, nations, and languages" to obey (v. 4). When a combination of instruments sounded, everyone was to "fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up" (v. 5). Those who refused to worship the image would be "cast into a burning fiery furnace" (v. 6), for refusal to bow was defiance of the king—this statue, after all, was his idea (vv. 2–3, 5, 7).

<span id="page-51-12"></span><span id="page-51-11"></span><span id="page-51-8"></span><span id="page-51-6"></span><span id="page-51-3"></span><span id="page-51-1"></span><span id="page-51-0"></span>3:7 The herald had spoken (vv. 4–6), and the idolatry was implemented: as soon as the people heard the instruments, they fell down and worshiped the image. In the commentary on chapter 1, we saw that "land of Shinar" (1:2) connected the setting to Genesis 11, where migrators "from the east" settled in Shinar (Gen. 11:2). Here again Genesis 11 is invoked. In Genesis 11:1, "the whole earth had one language and the same words," while in Daniel 3 the king's decree pertained to "peoples, nations, and languages" (3:4, 7). The dispersion after the Tower of Babel will one day be rectified when people from the nations gather in worship before the one true God, and Nebuchadnezzar's construction was a bizarre parody of that hope. The peoples, nations, and languages gathered on the Babylonian plain for idolatry announced by music; Nebuchadnezzar had constructed a place of counterfeit worship.

<span id="page-51-13"></span>3:8 The uncompromising nature of the king's decree provided incentive for some to accuse "the Jews"—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. "Certain" Chaldeans went to the king and "maliciously" made charges, but we are not told why. Perhaps the motive is jealousy of the king's appointment of the three Jews "over the affairs of the province of Babylon" (2:49; cf. 3:12).

<span id="page-51-15"></span><span id="page-51-14"></span>3:9–11 Those who were accusing Daniel's three friends flattered Nebuchadnezzar: "O king, live forever." Their plan was to draw the king into their rhetoric and guide him to the conclusion they hoped for, and so they reminded him of his decree:

everyone who heard the instruments was to worship the image. They reiterated the warning of death for dissenters (cf. v. 6).

<span id="page-52-6"></span>3:12 After reviewing the king's decree (vv. 9–11), the accusers reached the climax of their plan. They heightened the horror of the situation by reminding the king of how the Jews had acquired their Babylonian position: "There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego." The three men were "the Jews" referred to in verse 8, though their Babylonian names are used in verse 12. (Daniel had "remained at the king's court" [2:49] and so was not a target in this case.)

<span id="page-52-5"></span><span id="page-52-2"></span>The accusers personalized the behavior of the three Jews: "These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up." Surely, they reasoned, Nebuchadnezzar would not ignore such flagrant rebellion against his orders: the Jews had clearly ignored him, his gods, and his golden statue. We are not told how the accusers had learned of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego's refusal; likely the Chaldeans saw the three Jews refuse to bow down in worship when the instruments sounded the signal (3:5).

<span id="page-52-7"></span><span id="page-52-3"></span>3:13 The king's reaction was not surprising: in fury he ordered that "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought." Given their knowledge of the king's decree and their refusal to heed it, they surely knew what this summons would involve and how it would end.

<span id="page-52-8"></span><span id="page-52-4"></span><span id="page-52-1"></span>3:14–15 Nebuchadnezzar asked the three men if they had indeed refused to worship the image. He had granted them a standing in his court (1:20) and promoted them over the affairs of the province (2:49), yet despite his favors they defied him. Although the herald had warned, "Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace" (3:6), the king gave the three Jews one more opportunity to worship the image. If they did, all would be "well and good." But if they persisted in their initial refusal, they would "immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace." Their high position in the province did not exempt them from the king's decree.

Nebuchadnezzar was so confident of his power that he boldly mocked the possibility of any deliverance: "Who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?"

<span id="page-52-10"></span><span id="page-52-9"></span><span id="page-52-0"></span>3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego had appeared in chapters 1 and 2, but 3:16–18 contains their only recorded words. Referring to Nebuchadnezzar's question about which god would deliver them, they declared, "We have no need to answer you in this matter." Nebuchadnezzar demanded their obedience, but they felt no obligation to explain themselves. With their lives on the line, their courage must have seemed brazen and outrageous. They did not beg to be spared, nor did they buckle in compromise.

<span id="page-52-13"></span><span id="page-52-12"></span><span id="page-52-11"></span>3:17 There are two "if" statements in verses 17–18; the first imagines the deliverance of the three Jews (v. 17), while the second imagines their martyrdom (v. 18). If they were thrown into the fire, "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king." Nebuchadnezzar desired their worship of *his* gods and golden image, but the God of the Jews was the one "whom we serve." Furthermore, although the king had mocked the idea that any god could deliver them from his hands (v. 15), they insisted that their God was able to deliver them out of his hand.

<span id="page-53-2"></span><span id="page-53-1"></span>3:18 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were aware that rescue was not guaranteed. But even if God did not spare them from a fiery death, they said, "Be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up." They did not know what God would do, but they knew what they would *not* do.

<span id="page-53-3"></span><span id="page-53-0"></span>3:19 Nebuchadnezzar's face showed even greater fury (cf. v. 13), and he "ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated." This directive was hyperbolic, meaning simply that the furnace-keepers were to make it as hot as it could get!

<span id="page-53-4"></span>3:20–21 Wasting no time, Nebuchadnezzar ordered "some of the mighty men of his army to bind" the three Jews and cast them into the furnace. There would be no escape on the way to the furnace nor once inside it. The mighty men bound the faithful youth, who were still wearing "their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments" (v. 21). Clothing could catch fire easily and thus accelerate the process.

<span id="page-53-7"></span><span id="page-53-5"></span>3:22–23 As Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into the furnace, its extreme heat killed "those men who took up" the Jews, an unintended consequence of the king's order—clearly, no human could survive this furnace.

<span id="page-53-8"></span>3:24 The design of the furnace allowed observers to see inside, and Nebuchadnezzar became "astonished and rose up in haste" when he noticed something unusual inside the flames. He asked his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?" They told him this was indeed the case.

<span id="page-53-9"></span>3:25 With the facts now verified, the king made an astounding observation. The condition of the men was nothing like the king and onlookers had expected. Instead of three, there were four men in the furnace. These men were unbound and, remarkably, were "walking in the midst of the fire" unhurt. They should have been overcome by the flames and killed, just as those who threw them into the furnace had perished in the process (v. 22).

<span id="page-53-10"></span><span id="page-53-6"></span>The appearance of the fourth man in the furnace was "like a son of the gods." This figure did not seem to be a man like the other three. Inside the furnace, someone heavenly—maybe even divine—was among them. The figure in the furnace could have been an angel of the created heavenly host, for Nebuchadnezzar will call him God's "angel" in verse 28. Or he could have been the unique angel of Yahweh, whose appearances in the OT could perhaps have been the preincarnate second person of the Trinity.23 If the fourth man in the furnace was the Son of God, then Nebuchadnezzar spoke better than he knew when he concluded the fourth figure looked "like a son of the gods."

<span id="page-54-12"></span>3:26 The king of Babylon had witnessed the unthinkable: a divine vindication of the God-worshiping Jews. Knowing his chastisement of them had been a terrible overreaction, he went to the furnace door—which may have been ground-level and called for them to come out. Not only did Nebuchadnezzar speak their names, he also characterized them as "servants of the Most High God" (v. 26), acknowledging the God of their allegiance. His language should not be unduly pressed to imply his conversion, however. After all, in 2:47 he had called Daniel's God the "God of gods" and "Lord of kings," yet he had remained a pagan ruler and set up an image for worship (3:1–5).

<span id="page-54-4"></span><span id="page-54-3"></span>The three faithful Jews emerged from the furnace. There was no report as to what happened to the fourth man, although it is reasonable to assume he was no longer present in the furnace nor among those who exited—he probably vanished just as suddenly as he had appeared.

<span id="page-54-13"></span><span id="page-54-5"></span>3:27 Some from the groups listed in verse 2 gathered to view the miraculously spared Jewish young men. They saw that "the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men." The hair and clothing of the Jews were undamaged; no one could discern the scent of smoke. The guards who threw them in had perished instantly, yet the faithful Jews were fully intact. There was no evidence they had even been in the fiery furnace! Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were living examples of the promise of Isaiah 43:2: "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you." God was with his people through the presence of the fourth man, who looked "like a son of the gods" (Dan. 3:25).

<span id="page-54-11"></span><span id="page-54-9"></span><span id="page-54-7"></span><span id="page-54-6"></span><span id="page-54-2"></span><span id="page-54-1"></span>The deliverance of the three Jews from the fiery furnace may have communicated an impending deliverance for all of God's exiled people from Babylon. In Deuteronomy 4, Egypt was compared to a furnace: "The Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of his own inheritance, as you are this day" (v. 20). This background is significant, because in the context Moses reminded the hearers that Yahweh spoke out of the "fire" (v. 15), he warned against making an image for themselves (vv. 16–18), and he prohibited bowing down and serving what was not God (v. 19), for God himself was a consuming fire and a jealous God (v. 24). In Daniel's day, the exiled Jews were now under the control of Babylon, a new Egypt, a new furnace. An image had been built, and people were commanded to worship and serve what was not God. But God's people were to endure in faithfulness, for just as the furnace of Egypt had ended with the exodus, so the exile to Babylon would end with a return to Jerusalem—a *new*

<span id="page-54-10"></span><span id="page-54-8"></span><span id="page-54-0"></span><sup>23</sup> In certain OT passages, it appears that the angel of Yahweh is divine and thus distinct from created angels. Cf. Genesis 16:7–11; Exodus 3:2–6; Judges 2:1; 6:11–14; 13:3–22.

exodus. God's covenant love was stronger than Nebuchadnezzar's domineering grasp. The deliverance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego sent a hopeful message: God was at work in Babylon and had not forgotten his people.

<span id="page-55-11"></span><span id="page-55-10"></span><span id="page-55-9"></span><span id="page-55-2"></span>In the NT, this rescue is an important example of God's power that the author of Hebrews recounts for his first-century readers, writing that God had "quenched the power of fire" (Heb. 11:34).24 He highlights that the people in Daniel 3 acted "through faith" (Heb. 11:33), an example he wants his readers to emulate. According to Hebrews 11:35, God's power to deliver his people will be manifested ultimately in bodily resurrection from the dead. The furnace rescue, then, while inspiring wonder and hope, is but a type of the greater rescue on the last day, when the voice of Christ will undo death with resurrection life (John 5:28–29).

<span id="page-55-8"></span><span id="page-55-5"></span><span id="page-55-1"></span>3:28–29 Near the end of chapter 2, Nebuchadnezzar had ascribed lofty titles and power to God for revealing the content and meaning of his vision, and near the end of chapter 3 he once more turned his words to God: "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants" (v. 28). This statement is the answer to his question in verse 15: "Who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?"

<span id="page-55-4"></span>The "servants" may have been identified by their Babylonian names, but they did not have Babylonian hearts. The king characterized them as those who "trusted in [God], and set aside the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God" (v. 28). These actions are logically connected: their trust in God explained why they did not follow the king's decree, and their rejection of the king's decree explained why their bodies would face death. If obedience to Nebuchadnezzar meant disobedience to God, they resolved to yield their bodies to the flames.

<span id="page-55-3"></span>In light of the rescue, Nebuchadnezzar issued another decree encompassing every "people, nation, or language" (v. 29; cf. v. 4). Disobedience to this decree would also result in death, although this time not in a fiery furnace. Anyone who spoke against the God of the three Jews "shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way." The explanation for the terrible fate is the uniqueness of God: no other god could do what he did.

<span id="page-55-6"></span>3:30 Another parallel with the conclusion of chapter 2 is the promotion of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego "in the province of Babylon." Their new positions are not specified, and this is the final reference to these three faithful Jews in the book of Daniel.

## *Response*

God is worthy of our trust, even if obeying him means death. Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his

<span id="page-55-7"></span><span id="page-55-0"></span><sup>24</sup> The previous phrase in Hebrews 11—"stopped the mouths of lions" (v. 33)—also alludes to the book of Daniel (Dan. 6:22). This juxtaposition increases the probability that the book of Daniel is its source.

cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?" (Matt. 16:24–26).

<span id="page-56-3"></span>Nothing is worth compromising our discipleship. No gain in power or safety or money or reputation or relationships is worth forsaking devotion to the world's true Lord. The confidence of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego was rooted in who God is and was not conditioned on whether or not they would receive a temporal rescue. Readers of the book of Daniel needed to know God's covenant love and king-trumping power, for faithfulness would be needed during the subsequent Persian, Greek, and Roman kingdoms and beyond. God calls his people to endure, and sometimes that endurance comes at great earthly cost.

<span id="page-56-2"></span>There are realities worse than physical death. Jesus warned, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matt. 10:28). Hell is worse than a fiery furnace. Eternal life with Christ is better than dishonoring him in order to avoid inconvenient sacrifice. But if man is whom we fear, if man's approval is what we seek, our allegiance is a facade that will be exposed by how each of us completes the following sentence: "I will follow Christ, unless . . ."

<span id="page-56-1"></span><span id="page-56-0"></span>Unwavering faithfulness to God is a testimony worth modeling for unbelievers. The three faithful young men in Daniel 3 modeled such faithfulness as a testimony to Nebuchadnezzar, who recognized the superiority of the God they served (v. 29). Not every stand on conviction will lead to promotion, however. Demotion, ostracism, unemployment, and/or ridicule could be the outcome instead. For some believers around the world, faithfulness may lead to an unpleasant death. Nevertheless, God's people are not called to ambiguous discipleship. We serve God Almighty, who has revealed himself in Jesus Christ his Son. This means a disciple's primary aim should not be to blend in with idolaters but to be a clear and faithful witness to the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The apostle Paul experienced both deliverance and great cost in his faithfulness to Christ. His attitude was straightforward: "Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ" (Phil. 3:7–8).

<span id="page-56-5"></span><span id="page-56-4"></span>Seeking prolonged life through compromise may avoid temporary suffering, but death will come one day to each of our bodies if Christ does not return first. It is better to follow Christ, then: even if the body goes into a fiery furnace, God will either quench the flame in rescue or glorify the body in resurrection. Until then, what can separate us from the love of Christ? Shall Babylonian kings or dreadful decrees or malicious opponents or government intimidation or fiery furnaces? "No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us" (Rom. 8:37).

May our conviction align with Luther's words in "A Mighty Fortress":

<span id="page-57-0"></span> Let goods and kindred go, This mortal life also; The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still, His kingdom is forever.

## DANIEL 4:1–37

4 *<sup>1</sup>* King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you! **<sup>2</sup>** It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.

**<sup>3</sup>** How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endures from generation to generation.

**4** *2* I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace. **<sup>5</sup>** I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me. **<sup>6</sup>** So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. **7**Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation. **8**At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods*<sup>3</sup>*—and I told him the dream, saying, **<sup>9</sup>** "O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too difficult for you, tell me the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation. **<sup>10</sup>**The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. **11**The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth. **<sup>12</sup>** Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.

**<sup>13</sup>** "I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven. **14**He proclaimed aloud and said thus: 'Chop down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches. **<sup>15</sup>**But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the

dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth. **<sup>16</sup>**Let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him. **17**The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men.' **<sup>18</sup>**This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you."

**<sup>19</sup>**Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a while, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king answered and said, "Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you." Belteshazzar answered and said, "My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies! **20**The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth, **21**whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived— **<sup>22</sup>** it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth. **23**And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,' **<sup>24</sup>** this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king, **<sup>25</sup>** that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will. **26**And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules. **27**Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity."

**<sup>28</sup>**All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. **29**At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, **<sup>30</sup>** and the king answered and said, "Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?" **<sup>31</sup>**While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, "O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, **<sup>32</sup>** and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will." **<sup>33</sup>** Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws.

**<sup>34</sup>**At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever,

 for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation; **<sup>35</sup>** all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, "What have you done?"

**<sup>36</sup>**At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me. **37**Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-59-2"></span><span id="page-59-1"></span><span id="page-59-0"></span>Nebuchadnezzar has a dream that no one but Daniel can interpret: a tree grows to a great height and provides food and shade for animals, yet a command is given for it to be chopped down to a stump (4:5–7, 8–16). The lesson of the dream concerns God's rule over earthly kings and kingdoms (v. 17): Nebuchadnezzar is the tree (vv. 20–22), and God will humble him if he does not repent and practice righteousness (vv. 25–27). God fulfills the dream by giving him the mind and behavior of a beast (vv. 29–33). Once God restores Nebuchadnezzar's faculties, the king praises God and declares his unconquerable sovereign power (vv. 34–37).

<span id="page-59-5"></span>This narrative begins with the lesson Nebuchadnezzar learned as a result of the events recounted in this chapter and ends with the same exclamation: God's <span id="page-60-15"></span>dominion is forever (1 and 1'). Also common to 1 and 1' is language addressing everyone who dwells on earth (vv. 1, 35).

The next sections of the chiasm relate Nebuchadnezzar's dream that troubles him (2) and this dream becoming a reality that humbles him (2'). In the former, he prospered in his palace but became fearful (2), and in the latter he became prideful in his palace and experienced the dream's fulfillment (2').

3 and 3' provide a contrast between the Babylonian wise men and Daniel. Even though Nebuchadnezzar told his wise men the dream, they did not attempt to interpret it. Daniel, however, interpreted the dream after the king described its content.

<span id="page-60-11"></span><span id="page-60-9"></span><span id="page-60-2"></span>Nebuchadnezzar's description of the dream is the central section (4). This description is itself an inclusio, marked by the language in verses 8–9 and 18 that includes the name "Belteshazzar," a reference to "the spirit of the holy gods," and a recognition of the wise men's inability contrasted with Daniel's ability. Within the inclusio (vv. 8–9, 18) are two distinct subsections: verses 10–12 and verses 13–17. The first subsection describes the activity of the tree (vv. 10–12), while the second subsection relates the command of the watcher against that tree (vv. 13–17). Each subsection begins similarly: "The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold . . ." (v. 10) and "I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold . . ." (v. 13).

<span id="page-60-17"></span><span id="page-60-14"></span><span id="page-60-12"></span><span id="page-60-10"></span><span id="page-60-3"></span><span id="page-60-0"></span>Chapter 4 stands out from chapters 1–3 as first-person narration from Nebuchadnezzar's point of view (cf. 4:1, 4, 18, 34, 37). Only in this chapter of the book does someone other than Daniel convey a first-person account (cf. 8:1; 9:2; 10:2; 12:5). There is a brief transition to a third-person vantage point in 4:28–33, but the verses surrounding it (vv. 1–27, 34–37) are the king's account. Chapter 4 is the last chapter in the book featuring Nebuchadnezzar as a character.

## <span id="page-60-5"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-60-8"></span><span id="page-60-6"></span><span id="page-60-4"></span>4:1–3 Chapter 4 begins like a letter: "King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you!" Nebuchadnezzar ruled Babylon, yet his message's recipients extended far beyond his empire. The purpose of his account was "to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me" (v. 2). These wonders include a vision and an interpretation of the vision (vv. 4–27), a judgment involving beastly behavior (vv. 28–33), a restoration of his reason (vv. 34–35), and an increase of his greatness (vv. 36–37). Due to the emphasis on God's granting the kingdoms of men to whomever he will (vv. 17, 25–26, 32), the king's humiliation and restoration are especially in view. As Nebuchadnezzar made clear, the "Most High God" did these wonders (v. 2; cf. 3:26).

<span id="page-60-16"></span><span id="page-60-13"></span><span id="page-60-7"></span><span id="page-60-1"></span>With two pairs of parallel statements, Nebuchadnezzar extolled God's deeds and rule (4:3). The content of the first line in each pair is repeated in the second line. His deeds are "great" and "mighty" and are called "signs" and "wonders." God's rule is synonymous with "kingdom" and "dominion," and its duration is "everlasting" and "from generation to generation." The hymn-like nature of verse 3 resembles the acclaim of Yahweh voiced by his prophets, but the words did not imply true worship from Babylon's king. To him, "God Most High" was real, but he was not God alone.

<span id="page-61-13"></span><span id="page-61-12"></span>4:4–5 After the greeting and stanzas of praise (vv. 1–3), the king identified his location and condition: "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace" (v. 4). This description of prosperity will be important for the end of the story, when God will add even more greatness to the king (v. 36).

<span id="page-61-19"></span><span id="page-61-14"></span><span id="page-61-5"></span>Nebuchadnezzar's admission, "I saw a dream that made me afraid" (v. 5), reminds the reader of 2:1. Once again he saw a vision from God while sleeping. What he saw—"fancies" and "visions"—alarmed him because without understanding their meaning he could not discern how they applied to him or his kingdom.

<span id="page-61-15"></span><span id="page-61-4"></span>4:6–7 Nebuchadnezzar summoned "all the wise men of Babylon" to interpret his dream (cf. 2:2). The wise men came, but, also mirroring the account in chapter 2, they failed to interpret the vision. On this occasion, however, Nebuchadnezzar told them the dream (cf. 2:5–6).

<span id="page-61-16"></span><span id="page-61-7"></span><span id="page-61-6"></span>4:8–9 After the wise men's failure, Daniel arrived. Because their previous failure had been followed by Daniel's success (2:10–11, 24–45), the reader is prepared for Daniel to interpret the dream. Nebuchadnezzar mentioned Daniel's Babylonian name (Belteshazzar) and explained he had chosen it "after the name of my god," Bel.

<span id="page-61-2"></span>The king told Daniel the dream because he believed "the spirit of the holy gods" was in Daniel. Only one other person in Scripture is described as having the spirit of the gods: Joseph (Gen. 41:38), who interpreted Pharaoh's dreams and rose to power in Egypt; Daniel is like a new Joseph. Nebuchadnezzar also called Daniel "chief of the magicians" (cf. Dan. 2:48), expressed his confidence in him, and asked for the interpretation. Surely the episode in 2:24–45 had strengthened Nebuchadnezzar's trust in this young man of Judah.

<span id="page-61-17"></span><span id="page-61-11"></span><span id="page-61-10"></span><span id="page-61-9"></span><span id="page-61-8"></span><span id="page-61-0"></span>4:10–11 The key image of the vision is "a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great." It grew in size and strength, and its top "reached to heaven" and "was visible to the end of the whole earth." This description echoes Genesis 2:9, where "the tree of life was in the midst of the garden." Like the stone of Daniel 2:35, the tree grew in size and visibility. But neither of those images guarantees that the tree of Daniel 4 is a positive picture. The concept of rebellion is evoked as the top of the tree reached to heaven, just as the Tower of Babel was intended to do (Gen. 11:4), and the Tower of Babel's location "in the land of Shinar" (Gen. 11:2) is mirrored by reference to that same land in Daniel 1:2. While the tree in Nebuchadnezzar's dream grew mightily and globally, the picture of "its top" reaching "to heaven" sounds an ominous note.

<span id="page-61-18"></span><span id="page-61-3"></span><span id="page-61-1"></span>4:12 The tree's "leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant," providing "food for all." The greatness of the tree gave shade for beasts and perches for birds. This provision and abundance evokes Edenic depictions of fruit for God's creatures <span id="page-62-1"></span><span id="page-62-0"></span>(Gen. 1:29–30; 2:16). Nebuchadnezzar mentioned "the beasts of the field" and "the birds of the heavens," echoing categories in Genesis 1. These allusions to Genesis suggest that the growing tree represents an increase in dominion.

<span id="page-62-6"></span>4:13–15 Nebuchadnezzar continued to relate his vision, describing what befell the tree. The king saw "a watcher," known as "a holy one," descend from heaven. This figure is an angel, with a message from God concerning the tree. He commanded, "Chop down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit." It was not specified who should carry out the orders, but the point of the downsizing is clear: *judgment*. The tree not only stopped growing; its status was reversed. With its strength and shade now severed, beasts and birds no longer had food or shade, and so they fled.

<span id="page-62-3"></span>The watcher commanded that the stump be left in the ground, "bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field." The mention of iron and bronze connect the reader to chapter 2, where the metals denoted kingdoms. The chopping and lopping of the tree and its branches indicate judgment, but the remaining of a stump implies the possibility of future growth. The watcher's next words, meanwhile, stress that whatever happened to the tree was by divine decree, and they seem to indicate that the stump was not an empire but a person: "Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth" (4:15).

<span id="page-62-9"></span><span id="page-62-8"></span>4:16 The watcher next gave instructions that the man in the king's dream be given the mind of a beast. Formerly akin to a great tree giving shade and sustenance to beasts, this ruler would become like a beast himself. The passive "be changed" and "be given" signal that this change is God's judgment, lasting until "seven periods of time pass over him." As the number seven suggests completion or perfection, its use here probably symbolizes that Nebuchadnezzar's punishment was for a thorough amount of time.

<span id="page-62-12"></span><span id="page-62-10"></span>4:17–18 The watcher's words are a "sentence," a temporary punishment. Its certainty is denoted by "*the decree* of the watchers" and "*the decision* by the word of the holy ones," and its purpose is clear: "that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men." This concept will reappear later, in similar language (vv. 25–26, 32). God ruled over any earthly kingdom and could remove it from whomever he wished and give it to whomever he wished. The mighty tree was a king who would learn through personal experience of God's power over earthly rulers.25 Even mighty kings were still "the lowliest of men."

<span id="page-62-7"></span><span id="page-62-5"></span><span id="page-62-4"></span>Nebuchadnezzar finished relaying the words of the watcher (vv. 14–17) as well as the content of the dream (vv. 10–17). In the final verse of the chiasm's center (vv. 8–18), the king declared, "This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw." In the rest of verse 18, he addressed Daniel, asking for the interpretation and expressing

<span id="page-62-11"></span><span id="page-62-2"></span><sup>25</sup> Compare the similar picture of judgment on Assyria as a mighty tree in Ezekiel 31.

confidence in him with language echoing verses 8–9. If the king was to understand the dream, Daniel was his only hope.

<span id="page-63-6"></span><span id="page-63-1"></span>4:19 Nebuchadnezzar had been alarmed by the dream (v. 5), and now Daniel likewise was alarmed as he considered its interpretation. The king recognized Daniel's dismay and said, "Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you," but this did not dilute Daniel's distress. After some reflection he said, "My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!" Daniel did not have good news.

<span id="page-63-7"></span><span id="page-63-2"></span>4:20–21 Daniel reiterated the description of the tree before interpreting it, echoing Nebuchadnezzar's description in verses 10–12.

<span id="page-63-8"></span><span id="page-63-0"></span>4:22 Perhaps as Nebuchadnezzar feared, *he* was the tree: "It is you, O king, who have grown and become strong" (recalling 2:38: "You are the head of gold"). Like the tree in his vision, Nebuchadnezzar's greatness "[had] grown and [reached] to heaven," as his Babylonian dominion stretched (hyperbolically) "to the ends of the earth."

<span id="page-63-9"></span>4:23 After reiterating the king's description of the tree (vv. 20–21) and interpreting it (v. 22), Daniel now reiterated the words of the watcher (v. 23) and interpreted them (vv. 24–26). This reflected the king's account as he first described the tree (vv. 10–12) and then relayed the words of the watcher (vv. 13–17).

<span id="page-63-3"></span>The words of the watcher were a command to chop down the tree, leaving only a stump bound with a band of iron and bronze, wet with the dew of heaven, for "seven periods of time" among the beasts of the field. In recounting the king's words, Daniel used the term "destroy," which accurately depicted the purpose of chopping down the tree. He omitted the man's receiving the mind of a beast (v. 16), but the reference to "seven periods of time" (v. 23) sufficiently alluded to that punishment (cf. v. 16).

<span id="page-63-10"></span><span id="page-63-5"></span>4:24–26 After repeating the instructions of the watcher (v. 23), Daniel clarified that the watcher did not speak with his own authority: "This is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king."

<span id="page-63-4"></span>The image of a great tree being chopped down would be fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar was "driven from among men." Nebuchadnezzar would not only dwell with the beasts; he would also eat like one, and his dwelling in the field would leave him covered with dew (cf. v. 15). When "seven periods of time" had passed, it would become evident to Nebuchadnezzar that "the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will" (v. 25), and restoration would ensue: the surviving stump meant Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom "shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules" (v. 26).26 Dominion had not been removed forever; the tree would grow again.

<span id="page-63-14"></span><span id="page-63-13"></span><span id="page-63-12"></span><span id="page-63-11"></span><sup>26</sup> The phrase "Heaven rules" (v. 26) appears only here in the book of Daniel and is synonymous with "the Most High rules" (v. 25).

Table 1.3 shows the order of the king's recounting of his dream, Daniel's reiteration of the king's words, and Daniel's interpretation of the vision. Since the king divided his recollection into two parts (the tree and the watcher's command), Daniel's interpretation did so as well.

<span id="page-64-0"></span>TABLE 1.3: The Second Dream: Order of Recounting, Reiteration, and Interpretation

<span id="page-64-4"></span><span id="page-64-2"></span>

| The King Recounted               | Daniel Reiterated               | Daniel Interpreted               |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| description of tree (vv. 10–12)  | description of tree (vv. 20–21) | description of tree (v. 22)      |
| watcher's command<br>(vv. 13–17) | watcher's command (v. 23)       | watcher's command<br>(vv. 24–26) |

<span id="page-64-7"></span><span id="page-64-6"></span><span id="page-64-3"></span>4:27 Daniel now offered counsel for the king that he hoped would be "acceptable." In light of a decree of judgment, Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar to "break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed." This counsel stated the same command in two ways (table 1.4).

TABLE 1.4: The Second Dream: Daniel's Counsel for the King

| break off       | your sins       | by practicing righteousness,       |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| and [break off] | your iniquities | by showing mercy to the oppressed. |

This structure makes clear that mercy on the oppressed should have characterized the deeds of the king, yet Nebuchadnezzar was merciless in this regard. He was an unrighteous ruler.

<span id="page-64-1"></span>Daniel exhorted Nebuchadnezzar to rule righteously, "that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity." The king's repentance would stay God's judgment. This kind of warning, coupled with a promise of clemency on the condition of repentance, was common among OT prophets (e.g., Jer. 18:8; 26:13; Joel 2:12–14; Amos 7:2–3). If Nebuchadnezzar continued on his current course, however, his tree would fall and the watcher's words would come to pass.

<span id="page-64-12"></span><span id="page-64-11"></span><span id="page-64-10"></span>Jesus may have been thinking of the vision of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4 when he told the parable of the mustard seed in Matthew 13. The tiny mustard seed, said Jesus, would become "a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches" (Matt. 13:31–32). The "birds" in the parable may have referred to Gentiles entering God's kingdom. Jesus, the true and better Adam, came to establish God's saving dominion. Unlike Nebuchadnezzar, an unrighteous king of an earthly kingdom, Jesus was the righteous king of the heavenly kingdom.

<span id="page-64-9"></span><span id="page-64-8"></span><span id="page-64-5"></span>4:28–30 The narration now shifts from first to third person. The punishment, which Daniel warned about in verses 22–26, "came upon King Nebuchadnezzar." It had been twelve months since Daniel had interpreted the dream (v. 29), which meant God had been incredibly patient with Nebuchadnezzar by giving him ample time to repent and practice righteousness (cf. v. 27).

<span id="page-65-8"></span>But Nebuchadnezzar had not repented. While on the roof of his palace in Babylon, he admired the city and boasted, "Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?" (vv. 29–30). The only other biblical figure described as walking on a palace roof was David, who walked on the roof of his palace, admired something (or some*one*), and responded in sin (2 Sam. 11:2–4).

<span id="page-65-9"></span><span id="page-65-7"></span><span id="page-65-0"></span>Nebuchadnezzar's rhetorical question revealed his prideful heart. He described Babylon as that "which I have built by my mighty power," a place "for the glory of my majesty" (Dan. 4:30). Even though the king had learned from Daniel that the God of heaven was sovereign over the vastness of the Babylonian kingdom (vv. 25–26), this knowledge did not shape his heart. The first vision (ch. 2) had led to an expression of prideful rebellion (ch. 3), and now a second vision is followed by another display of pride.

<span id="page-65-10"></span><span id="page-65-6"></span><span id="page-65-3"></span><span id="page-65-1"></span>4:31–32 God's judgment was swift. The words were "still in the king's mouth" when a heavenly voice proclaimed the kingdom's "departure" from his control, just as the watcher had warned twelve months earlier (vv. 22–23). The voice reminded the king what would happen next: "You shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field" (v. 32). He would eat grass like the beasts, for a specific amount of time, so that he could learn that the "Most High" God rules "the kingdom of men" and delegates his rule according to his sovereign pleasure.

<span id="page-65-11"></span><span id="page-65-5"></span><span id="page-65-4"></span>4:33 While twelve months had elapsed between Nebuchadnezzar's vision (vv. 4–27) and his prideful musing (v. 30), there was no interim between his boast and God's punishment: "*Immediately* the word was fulfilled." The mighty king was driven to the beasts and ate grass, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, exactly as the vision had prophesied (vv. 15, 23–25). With the mind of a beast, Nebuchadnezzar did not groom his hair or trim his nails. He was unkempt and disheveled. Those who may have been intimidated by this king now beheld his brutish, subhuman ways.

<span id="page-65-13"></span><span id="page-65-12"></span><span id="page-65-2"></span>4:34–35 In the final section of chapter 4, the narration shifts back from third person to first (vv. 34–37). When the seven periods of time ended, Nebuchadnezzar looked to heaven and, with reason now restored, praised and honored God. Nebuchadnezzar was forthright about his reason for praise: "His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation," evoking the opening words of the chapter (cf. v. 3). He had learned that his own rule was at the pleasure of the Most High, and his earthly dominion and majesty could vanish like vapor. God alone had true and lasting dominion.

Now in his right mind, the king of Babylon declared that under God's sovereign rule, "All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing." No one could compare with God. Nebuchadnezzar confessed God's sovereignty over every realm and everyone. None were outside his control, not even the formidable Nebuchadnezzar! If God wills to act, "None can stay his hand or say to him, 'What have you done?'"

<span id="page-66-9"></span><span id="page-66-6"></span><span id="page-66-5"></span>4:36 After Nebuchadnezzar's reason was restored, his "majesty and splendor" returned as well (fulfilling v. 26), recalling his status at the beginning of his narration (v. 4). The king's reputation returned as well, and this period of his reign was apparently more glorious than previous times.

<span id="page-66-3"></span><span id="page-66-2"></span>So far, each of the chapters in the book has concluded with some kind of further blessing and increase. Daniel and his friends stood out among all other magicians and enchanters of Babylon (1:19–20). Daniel was promoted to ruler of the province of Babylon and chief prefect over the wise men, and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were appointed over the affairs of Babylon (2:48–49). The three friends of Daniel later received a further promotion in the province (3:30). Now Nebuchadnezzar experiences increase, with "still more greatness" added to his restored majesty.

<span id="page-66-10"></span><span id="page-66-7"></span><span id="page-66-4"></span>4:37 The ruler of Babylon ended his account with a lofty acknowledgment— "I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven"—forming an inclusio with the opening verse of the subsection: the "Most High" (v. 34) was the "King of heaven" (v. 37). Calling God "King" is appropriate, since he has a kingdom and an everlasting dominion, and "of heaven" asserts God's superiority. Nebuchadnezzar began chapter 4 by identifying himself as "king" but ended the account by focusing on *God's* heavenly kingship.

Nebuchadnezzar grounded his praise in two truths about God. First, "All his works are right and his ways are just," and second, "Those who walk in pride he is able to humble" (v. 37). When Nebuchadnezzar reflected on God's temporal judgment (which had lasted "seven periods of time"), he did not conclude that God was wrong. Rather, God's works — including his humbling of Nebuchadnezzar— were right and just. Nebuchadnezzar expressed a crucial theological presupposition of the Bible: what God Almighty does is always right. The king's second reason for praising God disclosed that he had walked in pride but was humbled by God. Amid his delusions of grandeur, God brought him down. The king was a living illustration that "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall" (Prov. 16:18). He had failed to realize that "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he will" (Prov. 21:1).

## <span id="page-66-1"></span><span id="page-66-0"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-66-8"></span>If the living God is sovereign over all things, including earthly kings and kingdoms, our heart's posture should be one of humility. The proud have no legitimate basis for arrogance, since God does according to his will among the heavenly host and the inhabitants of earth (4:35). The king of Babylon finally learned this lesson as he experienced the power of God, concluding chapter 4 by recognizing that "Those who walk in pride he is able to humble" (v. 37).

Rulers may scoff at God, but they do so for naught. The psalmist asked,

 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? . . .

<span id="page-67-1"></span> He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. (Ps. 2:1, 4)

We should serve and trust this God who holds the rulers of the world in his hands and does with them as he pleases. We should fear this Creator against whom the world has rebelled and clenched their fists. He is mighty, and his dominion is everlasting.

<span id="page-67-4"></span><span id="page-67-0"></span>Crucial for our humility is a continual enthrallment with the majesty and worth of God. Nebuchadnezzar focused on his own glory (Dan. 4:30), but God made us for *his* glory (cf. Isa. 43:7). We are made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26), not in the image of an earthly leader. The tragic sinful condition of man is that we have not humbled ourselves before God Most High; rather, we have dishonored him and withheld our gratitude (Rom. 1:21). Instead of humility, we embrace idolatry (Rom. 1:23).

<span id="page-67-8"></span><span id="page-67-5"></span>God revealed the truth of his greatness and everlasting kingdom to Nebuchadnezzar, who experienced humiliation that led to his blessing and praising God (Dan. 4:34). Thus God's judgment was simultaneously a display of mercy to Nebuchadnezzar, for it broke the king's pride. Temporarily receiving the mind of a beast turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to Nebuchadnezzar. Eating grass like an ox may have seemed ridiculous, but not as ridiculous as a heart entranced with human glory and status.

When God breaks through our delusions of grandeur and awakens us to his worth and majesty, it is a great mercy, regardless of the means of demolition. In our spiritual blindness, God may be pleased to grant sight. In his mercy he may grant life to the dead! If we trust Jesus, it is because God has been gracious to us despite our sinful state: "God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved" (Eph. 2:4–5).

<span id="page-67-10"></span><span id="page-67-9"></span>Any work of God that shows us his worth should lead to humility. Paul called the Philippians to consider the example of Jesus, "who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross" (Phil. 2:6–8). The greatest example of humility, therefore, is Jesus himself. When Satan offered him the kingdoms of this world and their glory, Jesus prevailed over that temptation (Matt. 4:8–9). His prayer to the Father, which he taught his disciples, was clear: "Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:10).

<span id="page-67-7"></span><span id="page-67-6"></span><span id="page-67-3"></span><span id="page-67-2"></span>Unlike Nebuchadnezzar, let us repent of our sins (Dan. 4:27). Let us follow God "in paths of righteousness for his name's sake" (Ps. 23:3). Let us pray for the mercy <span id="page-68-2"></span><span id="page-68-1"></span><span id="page-68-0"></span>of glimpsing with our un-glorified minds the supremacy of God, and let us rejoice that "none can stay his hand" (Dan. 4:35) in anything he does. May our prayer be the fitting words of John the Baptist, who said of Christ, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30).

## DANIEL 5:1–31

5 King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.

**<sup>2</sup>**Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father*<sup>1</sup>* had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them. **3**Then they brought in the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them. **4**They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

**<sup>5</sup>** Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, opposite the lampstand. And the king saw the hand as it wrote. **6**Then the king's color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together. **7**The king called loudly to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king declared*<sup>2</sup>* to the wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom." **8**Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation. **9**Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed, and his lords were perplexed.

**<sup>10</sup>**The queen,*<sup>3</sup>* because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall, and the queen declared, "O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change. **11**There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods.*<sup>4</sup>* In the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers, **12**because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation."

**<sup>13</sup>**Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, "You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah. **<sup>14</sup>** I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods*<sup>5</sup>* is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you. **15**Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter. **<sup>16</sup>**But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."

**<sup>17</sup>**Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation. **18**O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty. **19**And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled. **20**But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him. **21**He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will. **22**And you his son,*<sup>6</sup>* Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, **23**but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.

**<sup>24</sup>** "Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed. **25**And this is the writing that was inscribed: Mene, Mene, Tekel, and Parsin. **26**This is the interpretation of the matter: Mene, God has numbered*<sup>7</sup>* the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; **<sup>27</sup>**Tekel, you have been weighed*<sup>8</sup>* in the balances and found wanting; **<sup>28</sup>**Peres, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."*<sup>9</sup>*

**<sup>29</sup>**Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

**<sup>30</sup>**That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed. **<sup>31</sup>** *<sup>10</sup>* And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-69-3"></span><span id="page-69-2"></span><span id="page-69-1"></span><span id="page-69-0"></span>At a great feast, King Belshazzar commands that temple vessels—which had been taken from Jerusalem—be used for wine and the praise of pagan gods (5:1–4). In response to this act, a hand appears at the feast and writes on the palace wall (v. 5), but none of the king's men can decipher the message (vv. 7–8). The queen suggests Daniel as the most likely interpreter (vv. 10–12), and when he arrives, he rebukes

<span id="page-70-7"></span><span id="page-70-6"></span>Belshazzar for not heeding the lesson about humility that Nebuchadnezzar had learned (vv. 20–22). The writing on the wall is a message of judgment against Belshazzar and the Babylonian kingdom (vv. 24–28).

<span id="page-70-5"></span>Daniel 5 begins and ends with Belshazzar. The opening verse reports a great feast (1), and the final verses report the king's death (1'). The intervening sections explain why Belshazzar does not survive the night of the banquet. On two occasions in the story, he gives explicit commands, one for the temple vessels to be brought to the banquet (2) and the other for Daniel to be rewarded for his help (2').

The drama picks up the pace once a hand appears and writes a message on the palace wall (3). In the literary arrangement of the chapter, the matching section (3') records the interpretation of the cryptic writing. The wise men cannot discern the meaning (4) while Daniel can (4'). The verses in 4 are framed by an inclusio, for verses 6 and 9 both speak of the king's alarm and change of color. In the center of the chiastic structure is the queen's glowing endorsement of Daniel's abilities (5). These are her only words in the story—and in the book as a whole—and their location in the narrative indicates their importance.

<span id="page-70-4"></span>Daniel 5 is the final chapter of the narratives involving Babylon. (The events of chapter 6 take place under Medo-Persian rule.) In these chapters, only chapter 5 features a Babylonian king other than Nebuchadnezzar. However, the connection between the two kings in chapters 4–5 is evident—these two chapters are the center of the Aramaic chiasm (chs. 2–7) and each narrates God's judgment on a Babylonian king:

## *Comment*

<span id="page-71-9"></span><span id="page-71-8"></span><span id="page-71-1"></span>5:1 Belshazzar, a successor of Nebuchadnezzar, threw "a great feast" for a thousand lords. Daniel was not present at the festivities (cf. v. 13), either because he had not been invited or because his former prominence did not continue under Belshazzar (cf. vv. 10–12, where the queen informed the king about Daniel). During the feast, Belshazzar "drank wine in front of the thousand," displaying privilege and arrogance.

<span id="page-71-3"></span><span id="page-71-2"></span>5:2 The mention of temple vessels reminds us of chapter 1, in which Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, took the temple vessels, brought them to Babylon, and put them in "the treasury of his god" (1:2). These vessels had remained in the pagan temple since that time, but Belshazzar called for them to be brought out so that his wives, concubines, and lords could drink from them—an act that would outrage a Jew. Belshazzar did something that not even "Nebuchadnezzar his father" had done.

Nebuchadnezzar was not Belshazzar's biological father but his ancestor. (The use of "father" could refer to either the immediately preceding king or a more distant predecessor; cf. ESV mg.) Belshazzar's biological father was Nabonidus, with whom he reigned as coregent from 550 to 539 BC.

<span id="page-71-5"></span>5:3–4 Once the vessels taken from "the house of God in Jerusalem" were brought to the feast, everyone present drank from them. Relocation of the vessels to a Babylonian god's temple (1:2) had defiled them already, but the attendees of the banquet defiled them further not only when they "drank wine" from them but also when they "praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone." The banquet guests reveled in blasphemy and idolatry. These elements are identical in name and order to those in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in chapter 2, with the exception of "wood" replacing "clay" (cf. 2:32–33).

<span id="page-71-4"></span>Belshazzar and his guests may have directed their attention to the gods because of the encroaching Medo-Persian army, which—according to the Babylonian Chronicle—had defeated Nabonidus and the Babylonian army merely fifty miles from Babylon two days earlier. In all likelihood, Belshazzar was aware of this defeat, yet he held the banquet in a brazen display of invincibility—and, as it turned out, delusion.

<span id="page-71-7"></span><span id="page-71-6"></span><span id="page-71-0"></span>5:5 The tone of the party changed when "fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace." Since this happened "immediately" after the guests drank wine from the Jerusalem temple vessels (v. 4), the event was viewed as an ominous response (v. 6). The detached hand wrote on the wall "opposite the lampstand," which illuminated the writing for all to see. This "lampstand" may have been one of the items from the Jerusalem temple. In the actual Jerusalem temple, the bread of the Presence stood opposite the lampstand (1 Kings 7:48–50; Ex. 25:23–26:37) to remind the people of Israel of God's provision and sustenance. If this lampstand was now in Belshazzar's Dani el 5:1–31 72

palace, then instead of illuminating an object of provision, it was illuminating a sign of judgment.

<span id="page-72-7"></span><span id="page-72-2"></span>5:6–7 Outwardly and inwardly, Belshazzar was undone and filled with fear, for he surmised that the writing on the wall was not a favorable sign. As Nebuchadnezzar had done, Belshazzar summoned the Babylonian wise men (cf. 2:2; 4:6), calling "loudly" out of fear and urgency. He promised three rewards to anyone who could interpret the writing on the wall: that person "shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom." The first and second rewards symbolized the regal status of the third; the interpreter would be the "third ruler in the kingdom" because Nabonidus and Belshazzar filled the first and second positions, being corulers at the time.

<span id="page-72-8"></span><span id="page-72-3"></span>5:8 Wise men arrived but could neither read nor interpret the writing on the wall. Their inability had precedent in previous chapters of the book, for Nebuchadnezzar's wise men had failed to discern the meaning of his visions (2:7, 10; 4:7) as well. Unique in this situation was the visibility of what needed to be interpreted: the writing was on the palace wall, where all could see, unlike the visions of Nebuchadnezzar, which were visible only to him in his dreams.

<span id="page-72-9"></span><span id="page-72-6"></span>5:9 Belshazzar remained alarmed, and his lords perplexed. This verse forms an inclusio with verse 6, where the king's fear and color were noted. Verse 9 also mentions a perplexed look shared by the thousand lords as their leader's mind and body pulsed and flushed with fear.

<span id="page-72-10"></span><span id="page-72-5"></span>5:10 The queen entered the banquet hall, presumably because someone had informed her of "the words of the king and his lords." She was not Belshazzar's wife, for his wives were already present at the banquet (vv. 2–3). She was probably Belshazzar's mother, wife of his father, Nabonidus.27

<span id="page-72-12"></span><span id="page-72-11"></span><span id="page-72-4"></span><span id="page-72-0"></span>5:11–12 The queen said, "There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods." Although she did not say the man's name, the reader knows she meant Daniel. He, like Joseph in Genesis, had the spirit of God (4:8–9, 18; cf. Gen. 41:38). Still without explicitly mentioning Daniel's name, the queen gave a brief history of Daniel's relationship with Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 5:11; cf. 2:48). Her description of Daniel in 5:11 was meant to stir the king's desire to see him before she actually names him in verse 12. The queen commended Daniel's God-given ability "to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems." She knew Daniel could explain the writing.

<span id="page-72-13"></span><span id="page-72-1"></span>Apparently Belshazzar did not know about Daniel, which provides another link with Joseph, as we recall how a new Pharaoh rose to power who "did not know Joseph" (Ex. 1:8). Under that new Pharaoh, the Israelites were in Egyptian captivity; under Belshazzar, the Israelites were in Babylonian captivity. Despite

<sup>27</sup> Cf. Sidney Greidanus, *Preaching Christ from Daniel: Foundations for Expository Sermons* (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2012), 164.

the new rulers in both of these situations, an exodus was promised. For the Jews in Egypt, God raised up Moses, who led them toward Canaan. For the Jews now captive in Babylon, their new exodus would mean a return to that same land. God had raised up a leader for them too, a Medo-Persian king who would arrive before the banquet night ended.

<span id="page-73-6"></span>5:13 When Daniel arrived, Belshazzar said, "You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah." The queen had probably informed Belshazzar of these facts, and he repeated them to remind Daniel of where each stood in relation to the other: Belshazzar was royalty, while Daniel was a captive. It had been decades since Daniel's journey from Jerusalem to Babylon (cf. 1:3–7), and he was now an old man.

<span id="page-73-7"></span><span id="page-73-5"></span><span id="page-73-0"></span>5:14–17 Belshazzar repeated the essence of what the queen had told him about Daniel (cf. v. 11), and he then informed Daniel of the problem: the Babylonian wise men could not "read this writing and make known to me its interpretation." Yet Belshazzar had heard that Daniel could "give interpretations and solve problems." If Daniel could decipher the writing, the king promised the same rewards he had offered to his wise men (cf. v. 7): purple clothing, a golden chain, and status as the third ruler. Daniel told the king to keep the rewards and give them to someone else. He agreed to interpret the writing, but not for profit.

<span id="page-73-8"></span><span id="page-73-4"></span>5:18–21 Before interpreting the writing, Daniel spoke about Nebuchadnezzar's greatness and humiliation, both of which had been granted to him by God. Daniel recalled that "the Most High God" gave Nebuchadnezzar "kingship and greatness and glory and majesty." The fourfold content of God's favor should not be parsed too finely and could be summarized, "God granted Nebuchadnezzar reign over a glorious empire." Because of Nebuchadnezzar's greatness, everyone feared him. He had held (what seemed to be) unassailable power: he decided who would die and who would live, whom he would raise up and whom he would humble.

<span id="page-73-2"></span><span id="page-73-1"></span>Belshazzar no doubt knew of the greatness of Nebuchadnezzar, but Daniel's recollection of his glory and majesty was necessary in order to emphasize his subsequent humiliation: Nebuchadnezzar's heart was lifted up, but God brought him down from his throne and took away his glory (cf. 4:19–25), after which the king, for a time, had thought and lived as a beast (cf. 4:16, 25, 32–33). The goal of such punishment was that Nebuchadnezzar would learn that "the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets it over whom he will" (5:21). Significantly, Daniel did not mention Nebuchadnezzar's restoration (4:34–37). He covered only the history relevant for Belshazzar, whose life would emulate the pattern of pride leading to demise, but for whom there would be no restoration.

<span id="page-73-10"></span><span id="page-73-9"></span><span id="page-73-3"></span>5:22–23 Belshazzar's failure, said Daniel, was not in knowledge but in application. He knew what had happened to his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar, but he did not humble his heart. He did not modify his behavior in light of the fact

<span id="page-74-5"></span><span id="page-74-3"></span><span id="page-74-2"></span>Having recounted what Belshazzar did not do, Daniel moved to what the king *did* do, and Daniel's boldness shines with prophetic conviction: "You have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven" (v. 23). The blasphemy at the banquet dishonored God. Not only did Belshazzar drink from the Jerusalem temple vessels with his lords, wives, and concubines (vv. 2–3), he also praised the gods of "gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone," which were idols unable to see, hear, or know anything (v. 4). The OT regularly characterizes idols in this way (cf. Deut. 4:28; Pss. 115:4–7; 135:15–17; Isa. 44:9–20). These non-gods were unable to do anything because they did not exist, yet these nonexistent non-gods were objects of praise! Daniel saved the most serious charge for last: "The God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored" (Dan. 5:23). Belshazzar was vulnerable because his very breath rested in God's hand—the hand that had written on the palace wall.

<span id="page-74-7"></span><span id="page-74-6"></span><span id="page-74-4"></span><span id="page-74-0"></span>5:24–25 Daniel explained the detached hand and ominous inscription as God's response to Belshazzar's sin, and he read aloud the writing on the wall: "Mene, Mene, Tekel, and Parsin." Apparently not even the Babylonian wise men could read those words (v. 8), which could perhaps be explained by the fact that the words apparently had no vowels and no spaces between them; knowing where to break up the words could be a dilemma. Daniel, however, was able to read the writing according to the proper breakdown of the letters into the intended words.

<span id="page-74-8"></span>5:26–28 Daniel interpreted each of the Aramaic words on the wall. "Mene" indicated that "God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end." A mina was a Babylonian weight or currency, equivalent to 60 shekels, and "Mene" sounded like the Aramaic word for "numbered." God had allotted only a certain amount of time to the Babylonian kingdom, and that time was up.

Focusing on "Tekel," Daniel told Belshazzar, "You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting." Whereas "Mene" pertained to the Babylonian kingdom, "Tekel" pertained to its current king. A tekel was equivalent to one shekel and sounded like the Aramaic word for "weighed." Belshazzar had been weighed by God and had come up short. His time as king was over.

<span id="page-74-1"></span>The third word on the wall was "Parsin," but Daniel used the singular form, "Peres": "Peres, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians." Peres was a half-mina and sounded like the Aramaic words for "divided" and "Persia." Daniel's statement thus supports our interpretation of the vision in chapter 2, that Babylon would be followed by the Medo-Persian kingdom and not simply the Medes. Persia had already conquered the Medes c. 550 BC before arriving on Babylon's doorstep in 539. Therefore Belshazzar's reign would end because of the Medo-Persian Empire (table 1.5).

<span id="page-75-6"></span><span id="page-75-3"></span><span id="page-75-2"></span>5:29 In response to the interpretation, Belshazzar commanded that Daniel be given purple clothing, a golden chain, and the position of "third ruler" in the kingdom. Belshazzar had promised these gifts to his wise men if they could read and interpret the mysterious writing, but they had failed (vv. 7–8). When Belshazzar offered the same rewards to Daniel for the same task, Daniel had refused them (vv. 16–17), but Belshazzar imposed the rewards anyway, perhaps because Daniel had already given the interpretation and had earlier made clear that he had no profit motive (v. 17). The concept of rewards accompanying Daniel's successful interpretation parallels each of the previous chapters, which end with someone increasing in blessing and stature or position (1:19; 2:48–49; 3:30; 4:36).

<span id="page-75-4"></span><span id="page-75-1"></span><span id="page-75-0"></span>TABLE 1.5: The Words on the Wall and Their Interpretation

<span id="page-75-7"></span>5:30 The night of the blasphemous banquet was the night Belshazzar died. He "was killed," but we are not told by whom. According to scholars who have correlated ancient records with our calendar, the night of Belshazzar's dinner and death was October 11, 539 BC.

<span id="page-75-9"></span><span id="page-75-8"></span>5:31 The Babylonian king fell, and so did the kingdom: "Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old." Darius appears to be the same king as in chapter 6, and his name appears again in 9:1 and 11:1. If Darius was the king of the Medo-Persians who conquered Belshazzar and the Babylonian kingdom, then we must address his relation to another figure, Cyrus the Persian, in 6:28.

<span id="page-75-10"></span>The name Cyrus already appeared in 1:21 and will appear later in 10:1. At first glance, the names "Darius the Mede" and "Cyrus the Persian" might seem to refer to two different individuals. But there is no extrabiblical evidence that a man named Darius ever ruled after Babylon fell,28 and thus Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian were most likely the same person.29 The last verse in chapter 6 juxtaposes "the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian" (v. 28), and a possible use of the Hebrew conjunction would be to equate the second phrase with

<span id="page-75-5"></span><sup>28</sup> Steinmann cautions, "However, that is merely an argument from silence and may simply reflect that such historical records of Darius have not survived or come to light yet" (*Daniel*, 290).

<span id="page-75-11"></span><sup>29</sup> The Old Greek and Theodotion have "Cyrus" rather than the MT's "Darius" in Daniel 11:1. Steinmann rightly notes, "Theodotion's version of Bel and the Serpent (Bel 1)" identifies "Darius as the Persian king Cyrus the Great" (*Daniel*, 293). Cf. Joyce G. Baldwin, *Daniel*, TOTC (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1978), 26–28.

the first.30 The same king, therefore, could have been known by either his Median or his Persian name. Cyrus's mother was Median while his father was Persian, a situation that could easily result in the ruler's having two names.31 Some other characters in the book of Daniel also have two names (cf. 1:7).

<span id="page-76-3"></span>The age of Darius is not an irrelevant detail. Since no other character's age is recorded in the book of Daniel, the number warrants close attention. "Sixty-two" (5:31) may be significant because it means Darius would have been born around the same time Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's first vision (c. 602 BC). That vision concerned a succession of earthly kingdoms and indicated that the Babylonian Empire would one day end. Little did Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel know that the one who would defeat mighty Babylon—Darius the Mede—would be born around that time. When Darius's years reached their appointed number, the kingdom of Babylon would be weighed and found wanting, and then fall.

<span id="page-76-2"></span>An age of "sixty-two years" also supports the identification of Darius the Mede as Cyrus the Persian. Cyrus died in 530 BC at the age of seventy, which means he was about sixty-two years old in 539 when he conquered Babylon. Important for biblical prophecy was how Babylon's defeat would mean the end of exile for the Israelites. As Isaiah had prophesied, the Lord's plan was to use Cyrus as his instrument to free his people (Isa. 44:21–45:13). In addition, prophecies also foretold that the Medes would attack Babylon (Isa. 13:17; 21:2; Jer. 51:11, 28), and thus it makes sense for Darius/Cyrus to be the one king of Medo-Persia who fulfilled these words.

### <span id="page-76-1"></span>*Response*

It is better to learn from the consequences of someone else's foolish choices than to choose foolishness ourselves and face its consequences. It is unfortunate that Belshazzar had not learned from Nebuchadnezzar's mistakes.

<span id="page-76-5"></span>One truth Belshazzar seemed to rebel against was his own vulnerability. He acted as if he were invincible and Babylon would continue forever. We may be made in the image of God, but we are merely human. James asks, "What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes" (James 4:14). People and empires are in the hands of a sovereign God, and their survival is dependent on his will (James 4:15). Daniel accused Belshazzar of dishonoring this God in whose hand was his very breath (Dan. 5:23). God is worthy of our honor, our worship. We should fear him, for he is holy and wise and altogether glorious. He alone is God, and he will not tolerate our idolatry.

<span id="page-76-6"></span><span id="page-76-4"></span>May we be eager to glorify and obey the living God, who has ordained the events of the past and who directs the future toward his appointed ends. He kept his promise when he judged Judah and sent them into exile, and he kept his promise that Babylon's hold on his people would not last forever. From youth to

<span id="page-76-0"></span><sup>30</sup> Cf. Steinmann, *Daniel*, 293, where he points to Daniel 2:28; 3:2; and 1 Chronicles 5:26 as other examples of *waw* (the Hebrew conjunction) functioning in this manner.

old age, Daniel remained confident in his faithful and benevolent God. He defied the law of the land when obeying it would have meant disobeying God. He spoke to the kings of Babylon with boldness and courage, telling them not what they wanted to hear but the truth as God had revealed it to him. How the character of almighty God should compel us! His sovereignty and faithfulness are foundational glories that should spur on our endurance and rouse our courage.

A detriment to our obedience is our idolatrous heart. We must beware the subtleties of pride and self-exaltation that justify themselves and insist that nothing bad could happen if they are indulged. Belshazzar did not humble his heart (5:22), and this was his undoing. As was the case for Nebuchadnezzar, pride goes before a fall (Prov. 16:18).

<span id="page-77-6"></span><span id="page-77-4"></span>We need people like Daniel so that we do not become people like Belshazzar. Believers need trustworthy people who will speak with conviction and kindness. The warnings and rebukes of godly friends will surely save us from many snares and grievances. We should not pretend we can live in wisdom and godly fear while still clinging to rigid individualism. In the opening section of Proverbs, Solomon warns, "Fools despise wisdom and instruction" (Prov. 1:7). The wicked man "dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray" (Prov. 5:23). Better to wound a heart by telling the truth than to placate a rebel on the path of destruction (Prov. 27:6).

<span id="page-77-8"></span><span id="page-77-5"></span><span id="page-77-3"></span><span id="page-77-2"></span><span id="page-77-1"></span>True wisdom is worth any price. Lady Wisdom says, "Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her" (Prov. 8:10–11). Our pursuit of wisdom must never be isolated from trusting and following the Lord Jesus Christ, "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Col. 2:3). The good news for idolaters—for all who, like Belshazzar, have exalted their hearts and gone astray into false worship—is Jesus. Paul reminded the Thessalonians of the gospel's power among them as they "turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come" (1 Thess. 1:9–10).

<span id="page-77-9"></span><span id="page-77-7"></span><span id="page-77-0"></span>May we humble ourselves and gain wisdom and so gain Christ, lest we lift ourselves up against the Lord of heaven and incur his wrath (Dan. 5:22–23). The Lord holds our breath, so let everything that has breath fear and praise the Lord (Ps. 150:6).

## DANIEL 6:1–28

<span id="page-78-0"></span>6It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom; **<sup>2</sup>** and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss. **3**Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. **4**Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. **5**Then these men said, "We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God."

**<sup>6</sup>**Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement*<sup>1</sup>* to the king and said to him, "O King Darius, live forever! **7**All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. **8**Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked." **9**Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.

**<sup>10</sup>**When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. **11**Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God. **12**Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, "O king! Did you not sign an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?" The king answered and said, "The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked." **13**Then they answered and said before the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."

**<sup>14</sup>**Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him. **15**Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, "Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed."

**<sup>16</sup>**Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared*<sup>2</sup>* to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!" **17**And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. **18**Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.

**<sup>19</sup>**Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. **20**As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?" **21**Then Daniel said to the king, "O king, live forever! **<sup>22</sup>**My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm." **23**Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. **24**And the king commanded, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.

**<sup>25</sup>**Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: "Peace be multiplied to you. **<sup>26</sup>** I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel,

 for he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end. **<sup>27</sup>** He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders

 in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions."

**<sup>28</sup>** So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

They convince the king to sign a thirty-day ordinance that prayer be made only to him and that those who refuse be cast into a den of lions (vv. 6–9). Daniel maintains his practice of prayer to God (v. 10), and Darius orders him to be thrown into the den (vv. 10–17). The next morning Darius learns that God has saved Daniel from the lions (vv. 18–22) and then he orders that Daniel be removed from the den and the accusers and their families be thrown into it instead (vv. 23–24).

The narrative begins and ends with Daniel experiencing favor under the reign of Darius (1 and 1'). Between these descriptions of Daniel prospering are two occasions of Darius issuing a command. Darius signs a document stating that everyone must pray only to him for thirty days (2), but later he decrees that people are to tremble before Daniel's God (2'). Conspirators go to Darius to accuse Daniel of violating the law about prayer (3), but in an ironic and fitting end to the story, the accusers themselves are thrown into the lions' den (3').

King Darius cannot renege on his ordinance to punish anyone who prays to someone other than him, so he is greatly distressed when the conspirators accuse Daniel (4). The king's distress turns to great relief and gladness, however, when he learns that Daniel has been spared from death (4'). Even though Darius had reluctantly ordered Daniel's death (5), God had sent an angel to close the mouths of the lions and thus deliver Daniel (5').

The center of the chiasm is Darius's sleepless night and hasty return to the den the next morning (6). These verses (vv. 18–20) may have been placed at the center of the chapter because they indicate the king's hope that Daniel would survive: "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?" (v. 20). The previous events in chapter 6 lead up to that suspenseful and hopeful question, and everything that happens afterward proves that the power of God has indeed delivered his servant.

<span id="page-80-6"></span><span id="page-80-2"></span><span id="page-80-0"></span>Chapter 6 is the first narrative in the book that takes place under the Medo-Persian Empire. The events of chapters 1–5 were under Babylonian kings; now the Medo-Persians rule. Chapter 6 is also part of the book's Aramaic chiasm (chs. 2–7), strategically matching chapter 3, where another divine deliverance took place:

### <span id="page-81-9"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-81-5"></span>6:1–2 King Darius installed "120 satraps" and "over them three high officials." This authority structure was probably in place within the first year after Darius's arrival and included Daniel as one of the three high officials (or presidents); to Daniel, "these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss."

A satrap was a protector of the kingdom, so Darius's appointment of Daniel shows the king's great trust in the Hebrew prophet. Darius likely believed Daniel could stave off signs of political corruption, especially financial loss. He probably learned about Daniel's faithful service to Nebuchadnezzar, which explained his confidence. Furthermore, if he learned of Daniel's prediction regarding Belshazzar's downfall, he presumably would have trusted Daniel even more.

<span id="page-81-6"></span><span id="page-81-0"></span>6:3 Now in his eighties, Daniel still stood out from others, just as he had as a teenager (1:17–20). His "excellent spirit" probably refers to his humble and wise demeanor. Darius was so impressed with Daniel that he planned to promote him to his highest rank yet: a position "over the whole kingdom."

<span id="page-81-7"></span>6:4–5 Once it became clear how much favor Daniel had garnered with King Darius, the other high officials and satraps "sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom." They wanted to turn Darius against Daniel; with Daniel out of the way, one of them could fill the vacancy. Their jealousy parallels the animosity of "certain Chaldeans" toward "the Jews" in 3:8–12.

<span id="page-81-1"></span>The problem for the jealous leaders was that they could find no fault in Daniel to expose. His faithfulness was so constant and evident that they had no grounds on which to accuse him before the king. Their jealousy led them to agree, "We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God." If Daniel's faithfulness was unwavering, they could use that faithfulness against him.

<span id="page-81-8"></span>6:6–9 The high officials and satraps conspired together and came to the king, who remained unaware of their plan. They addressed him with the common expression "O King Darius, live forever!" The leaders hoped to manipulate him unwittingly to facilitate Daniel's demise. They claimed that all the important people the king valued had agreed that a royal ordinance should be made concerning prayer: "Whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."

The nature of their request accomplished two goals. First, it flattered the king, as prayer would be made to him for thirty days, and such flattery increased the likelihood of his consent. For thirty days he would be the people's god! Second, by focusing on the matter of prayer, the leaders could use Daniel's faithfulness against him. They were confident that if Darius issued an order contrary to Daniel's devotion, Daniel would remain faithful to "the law of his God" (v. 5).

<span id="page-82-2"></span>The conspirators knew that an incentive for obedience might be necessary, so they suggested that violators "be cast into the den of lions." With the fear of death hanging over them, the people would comply.

The high officials and satraps insisted that Darius "establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked."32 What appealed to the leaders was the irrevocable nature of Medo-Persian injunctions; otherwise the king might change his mind, when he discovered that Daniel was a violator. The conspirators successfully manipulated Darius (v. 9); all they needed now was time for Daniel to violate this royal injunction.

<span id="page-82-5"></span><span id="page-82-4"></span>6:10 The law became public knowledge. Daniel's behavior is described with great detail, noting his knowledge of the law and his place and habit of prayer. First, Daniel "knew that the document had been signed." Either the king spoke directly to his leaders about it—since probably not all 120 satraps had been present for the meeting with Darius in verses 6–9—or Daniel found out indirectly from a royal representative.

Second, Daniel "went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem." Windows facing Jerusalem were a symbol of hope for return from exile. Solomon had prayed that if God's people were ever exiled and then repented "with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and [prayed] to you toward their land" (1 Kings 8:48), then God would hear from heaven and forgive them and grant them compassion (vv. 49–50). Daniel knew the curse of exile was temporary. Moreover, he knew that since Babylon had been conquered, the return was imminent.

<span id="page-82-6"></span><span id="page-82-1"></span><span id="page-82-0"></span>Third, facing Jerusalem in his upper room, Daniel "got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously." During one of those previous times, Daniel had received the revelation of the seventy weeks (Dan. 9:1–3, 20–27), a revelation that would have strengthened his resolve during exile. "As he had done previously" shows that Daniel did not alter his behavior after finding out about the royal injunction. It is not specified how long Daniel had been practicing such prayerful devotion, but it is reasonable to assume he maintained such practice throughout his decades in this foreign land. No matter what ruler he served, no matter what empire was in power, no matter what rank he held, no matter how many friends or enemies he made, no matter how acceptable or risky his devotion, Daniel was a man of prayer.

<span id="page-82-3"></span><sup>32</sup> The "Medes and the Persians" (v. 8) is further textual testimony to the unity of Medo-Persia at this time in history.

<span id="page-83-6"></span><span id="page-83-2"></span><span id="page-83-1"></span>Daniel 6:10–13 is framed by an inclusio: Daniel violated the injunction by praying three times a day (v. 10), and the conspirers informed Darius that Daniel had violated the injunction by praying three times a day (v. 13).

<span id="page-83-3"></span>6:11 The conspirators knew where Daniel lived, and they agreed to go to his home and catch him praying to God. It would be difficult to universally enforce the new royal injunction regarding prayer, but the jealous leaders were not interested in the prayer habits of the masses. They cared only about Daniel. Since Daniel's habit was to pray three times a day with his windows open, the conspirers needed only to observe whether Daniel maintained his practice. Evidence of his thrice-daily prayer pattern would have been visible to onlookers below and, given his character, it was unlikely he would deny the charge.

<span id="page-83-5"></span>6:12–13 The high officials and satraps who had previously manipulated Darius now came to him and inquired whether they correctly understood the injunction. The king confirmed their understanding, insisting the injunction could not be revoked. The conspirators had the king right where they wanted him; it was time to expose Daniel as a lawbreaker: "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day." They accused Daniel of knowingly ignoring not only the injunction but the king himself.

<span id="page-83-7"></span>6:14 The king's reaction may have surprised the accusers, who surely hoped that knowledge of betrayal would provoke rage and swift action. On the contrary, Darius "was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel." He did not want Daniel to die, and he spent the rest of the day seeking a way to rescue him.

<span id="page-83-8"></span><span id="page-83-4"></span><span id="page-83-0"></span>6:15 The accusers would not tolerate the king's reluctance. Using words similar to verse 8, they reminded him that Medo-Persian ordinances could not be revoked, and Darius himself had already used the language of irrevocability (v. 12); despite his desire to spare Daniel, doing so would be going against "the law of the Medes and Persians."

<span id="page-83-9"></span>6:16–17 Bound by the wording of the royal injunction, Darius ordered that Daniel be cast into the lions' den. He told Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!" This statement recognized Daniel's devotion to God and expressed Darius's hope that the punishment would fail. Darius had kept his end of the matter by ordering Daniel, an exile from Judah now in his eighties, to be thrown to the lions. If Daniel's God happened to intervene and deliver the faithful servant, it was out of the king's hands.

To secure the lions' den, "A stone was brought and laid on the mouth" of it, and then Darius sealed it with his signet and the signet of the lords. No one would chance trying to rescue Daniel, and Daniel himself certainly could not escape: breaking the king's seal without authorization would warrant death.

<span id="page-84-6"></span>6:18–19 Darius returned to his palace and "spent the night fasting" and avoiding any diversions. His fasting was not for religious reasons; he was simply too overwhelmed to eat. His mind was occupied with Daniel's predicament, and nothing could distract him from these thoughts, not even sleep. Finally, at daybreak, Darius went to the den. His concern for Daniel was evident: he did not send a messenger but rushed there himself.

<span id="page-84-7"></span>6:20 Darius neared the lions' den and cried out in anguish to Daniel: "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?" Darius knew that Daniel worshiped "the living God," yet he was unsure if Daniel's God had the power to deliver him from the lions. The issue of God's ability was previously voiced in the narrative of the three faithful friends of Daniel, who declared to Nebuchadnezzar, "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace" (3:17). Chapters 3 and 6, each evoking God's ability to deliver his servant(s) from death, are paired in the Aramaic chiasm of the book, and furthermore, the two chapters are arranged chiastically, with each central section (3:16–18 and 6:18–20) reporting dialogue concerning God's ability to deliver.

<span id="page-84-8"></span><span id="page-84-1"></span><span id="page-84-0"></span>6:21–22 Daniel greeted the king and answered his question: "My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm."

<span id="page-84-10"></span><span id="page-84-2"></span>As in the deliverance of Daniel's three Jewish friends (3:25, 28), God had used an angel to rescue Daniel. The lions spared Daniel not because they lacked an appetite but because an angel shut their mouths (cf. Heb. 11:33). Daniel's lack of harm corresponded to his lack of blame: before God and before the king, Daniel had committed no act worthy of death in the lions' den.

<span id="page-84-9"></span><span id="page-84-5"></span>6:23 The king's distress (vv. 14, 18) gave way to exceeding gladness. The Judean exile had survived the night, as Darius had hoped, so the king ordered Daniel to "be taken up out of the den," much to the chagrin of the high officials and satraps who had conspired to put him there. When Daniel emerged, "no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God." This degree of protection parallels the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who emerged from the fiery furnace without singed hair, damaged cloaks, or the smell of smoke on them (3:27).

<span id="page-84-4"></span><span id="page-84-3"></span>It may seem that Darius violated his own royal injunction by removing Daniel, but in fact the king had followed the letter of the new law precisely. The injunction stipulated that violators would be cast into the den of lions (6:7, 12), but it did not instruct the king on what to do if the violator survived! Darius followed the law, and acted in response to a circumstance the law did not address. This whole ordeal demonstrated his commitment "to the law of the Medes and Persians" while at the same time displaying his authority as king.

Daniel's rising from the den is a picture of resurrection from the dead, just as Isaac's deliverance from near-sacrifice is described as a figurative resurrection by <span id="page-85-13"></span><span id="page-85-12"></span>the author of Hebrews (Heb. 11:19). The same concept is found in Jesus' interpretation of the story of Jonah (Matt. 12:40; cf. Jonah 2:1–10).

<span id="page-85-7"></span><span id="page-85-0"></span>6:24 Darius ordered Daniel's accusers to be thrown into the den of lions—"they, their children, and their wives." Their demise was an example of the justice we sometimes see in the OT (cf. Est. 7:7–10). They hoped Daniel would die in the lions' den, yet that fate was theirs instead. As soon as the accusers were thrown into the den, "The lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces" before their bodies could even hit the ground! This carnage confirms that Daniel's protection was not due to any natural cause, such as any lion's inability or lack of appetite. His survival could be explained only by divine deliverance.

<span id="page-85-8"></span><span id="page-85-2"></span>6:25 Darius wrote a message to "all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth." Such universal language appeared earlier (3:4, 7, 29; 4:1) and indicated a comprehensive application of "Peace be multiplied to you" (6:25), a typical wish for peace. What came next would distinguish the king's decree from the other message he had written.

<span id="page-85-9"></span>6:26–27 Darius decreed, "In all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel." The king was so impressed by God's intervention and his protection of Daniel that he wanted everyone to respond in a way he deemed appropriate: before a God who rescued his servant from lions, trembling and fear was warranted.

<span id="page-85-6"></span>Darius explained his new decree: "He is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end." He had already called the Lord "the living God" (v. 20), and now he wanted everyone to know more about this deity. Since God endured forever, it made sense that his kingdom and dominion would last forever as well. It was significant that Darius an emperor, no less—acknowledged that God's kingdom would endure, implying that the Medo-Persian kingdom would not. Nebuchadnezzar had made similar statements about God's kingdom (4:3, 34).

<span id="page-85-10"></span><span id="page-85-4"></span>Elaborating on the reasons people should tremble and fear Daniel's God, Darius wrote, "He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions" (6:27). The last phrase clarifies that Darius was not thinking of some abstract notion of deliverance. Instead, he had specifically in mind Daniel's deliverance from the den of hungry lions. Nebuchadnezzar had extolled God's power in rescuing Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the fiery furnace (3:28–29), and he also spoke of "signs" and "wonders" (4:3). In chapter 6, God continued displaying his mighty power, prevailing over the conspiracy of the high officials and straps, the concession of the reluctant king, and the appetite of savage beasts. All should fear and tremble before this mighty God.

<span id="page-85-11"></span><span id="page-85-5"></span><span id="page-85-3"></span><span id="page-85-1"></span>6:28 At or near the end of each narrative in chapters 1–6, at least one person is promoted or prospers in some way (table 1.6).

<span id="page-86-14"></span><span id="page-86-1"></span><span id="page-86-0"></span>

TABLE 1.6: Daniel 1–6: Promotion and Prospering

<span id="page-86-18"></span><span id="page-86-17"></span><span id="page-86-16"></span>It is noted specifically that Daniel prospered during "the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian" (6:28). These two names most likely refer to the same person (cf. comment on 5:31). Daniel was transported to Babylon as a teenager in 605 BC, and if the event of the lions' den occurred in 539, after the Medo-Persian Empire conquered the Babylonians, Daniel would have been in his eighties as he prospered during the reign of King Darius.

With the entirety of chapter 6 before us, at least twelve parallels can be discerned between it and the fiery furnace episode of chapter 3 (table 1.7).

## <span id="page-86-27"></span><span id="page-86-26"></span><span id="page-86-25"></span><span id="page-86-24"></span><span id="page-86-15"></span><span id="page-86-13"></span><span id="page-86-12"></span><span id="page-86-11"></span><span id="page-86-9"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-86-28"></span>Believing the truth of Peter's words may be challenging: "Rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you" (1 Pet. 4:13–14). The people of God <span id="page-87-2"></span>have always faced opposition, and the cost of following God's will sometimes led to persecution even in the OT. In Daniel's case, he knew King Darius had signed a document forbidding prayer to anyone but the king for thirty days, and he knew that violating this injunction would result in death in the lions' den (Dan. 6:7–10). Yet he went home and prayed and "gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously" (v. 10).

<span id="page-87-3"></span>Daniel remained grateful to God, even though his disciplined piety was under assault by conspirators manipulating the king's ear. Daniel still had God's ear, and so he prayed. He would not permit a royal injunction to nullify his faithful intercession. God could not be manipulated or fooled, and he reigned sovereignly and completely over the Medo-Persian Empire.

<span id="page-87-0"></span>Daniel was committed to obeying God, even when that obedience conflicted with service in Darius's administration. After all, Daniel was the target of the conspiracy because of his reputation for faithfulness. The "high officials and the satraps" who "sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel" sought in vain (v. 4). Daniel was not known for compromise. He was known for faithfulness, especially "in connection with the law of his God" (v. 5). As the apostle Peter wrote, if believers are going to suffer, let it be because of their identity as a follower of Christ and not because they committed any actual wrongdoing (1 Pet. 4:15–16).

<span id="page-87-9"></span><span id="page-87-6"></span><span id="page-87-4"></span><span id="page-87-1"></span>Christians should not presume that obedience will necessarily lead to earthly vindication as in the case of Daniel, who "prospered during the reign of Darius" (Dan. 6:28). But ultimate vindication will come. Some saints conquered kingdoms and quenched the power of fire and put foreign armies to flight (Heb. 11:33–34), but others were mocked and tortured and imprisoned and killed (vv. 35–36). Still, they will "rise again to a better life" (v. 35): they will be vindicated through resurrection from the dead.

<span id="page-87-8"></span><span id="page-87-7"></span><span id="page-87-5"></span>In the second century AD, when Polycarp faced martyrdom and received the command to identify Caesar as "Lord," his response was courageous and to the point: "Eighty-six years I have served Christ, and he never did me any wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?" Some believers may admire the boldness of Polycarp but doubt that they could ever take such a stand. But Christ is mighty to save and to sustain his saints. Courage like Polycarp's does not come by digging deep into our soul's recesses and mustering up bravado. Christ is our strength. He has grace for the weak and the wavering. He told his disciples, "When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you" (Matt. 10:19–20). We may think our weakness will undermine our witness, yet it is in weakness that God shows himself to be strong.

## DANIEL 7:1–28

<span id="page-88-0"></span>7In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. **2**Daniel declared,*<sup>1</sup>* "I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. **3**And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. **4**The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. **<sup>5</sup>**And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.' **6**After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. **7**After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. **<sup>8</sup>** I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.

**<sup>9</sup>** "As I looked,

thrones were placed,

and the Ancient of Days took his seat;

his clothing was white as snow,

and the hair of his head like pure wool;

his throne was fiery flames;

its wheels were burning fire.

**<sup>10</sup>** A stream of fire issued

and came out from before him;

a thousand thousands served him,

and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;

the court sat in judgment,

and the books were opened.

**<sup>11</sup>** "I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. **12**As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.

**<sup>13</sup>** "I saw in the night visions,

 and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man,

 and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.

**<sup>14</sup>** And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.

**<sup>15</sup>** "As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me *<sup>2</sup>* was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me. **<sup>16</sup>** I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things. **<sup>17</sup>** 'These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. **18**But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.'

**<sup>19</sup>** "Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet, **<sup>20</sup>** and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions. **21**As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, **22**until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.

**<sup>23</sup>** "Thus he said: 'As for the fourth beast,

 there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth,

and trample it down, and break it to pieces.

- **<sup>24</sup>** As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings.
- **<sup>25</sup>** He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.
- **<sup>26</sup>** But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.
- **<sup>27</sup>** And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom,

and all dominions shall serve and obey him.'*3*

**<sup>28</sup>** "Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart."

<span id="page-90-0"></span>Daniel receives a vision of four beasts rising out of the sea, the fourth beast being more fearsome than the others, and its little horn evoking concern (7:1–8). Shifting from the sea to heaven, Daniel's vision continues with the Ancient of Days judging the fourth beast (vv. 9–12). Then "one like a son of man" receives everlasting dominion over all (vv. 13–14). An angel explains that the four beasts are kings and that the saints will receive an everlasting kingdom (vv. 15–18). Daniel learns more about the fourth beast and its little horn (vv. 19–27).

In the first half of the chapter (vv. 1–14), sections a and a' provide an important contrast: the four beasts have dominion, but the one like a son of man is given *everlasting* dominion. The event connecting those two realities is the Ancient of Days' judgment. In a heavenly courtroom scene, God gives a verdict of destruction against the blasphemous beast (b).

<span id="page-90-6"></span>In the second half of the chapter (vv. 15–28), Daniel is alarmed at both the beginning (a) and the end (a') of the interpretation (b and b'). This inclusio means Daniel is bothered by both the vision he *sees* (a; vv. 1–14) and the interpretation he *hears* (a'; vv. 17–27). When the angel speaks about the vision (b), he identifies the

<span id="page-91-17"></span><span id="page-91-16"></span><span id="page-91-14"></span><span id="page-91-13"></span>four beasts as four kings (v. 17) and the "one like a son of man" as the saints who will receive an everlasting kingdom (v. 18). When the angel speaks again (b'), he elaborates on the fourth beast (v. 23), its ten horns and the little horn that arose after them (vv. 24–25), the judgment against the fourth beast (v. 26), and the saints' everlasting kingdom (v. 27). The angel's brief interpretation (b) is followed by a longer one (b') because of Daniel's inquiry about the fourth beast and its horns (c).

<span id="page-91-18"></span><span id="page-91-15"></span><span id="page-91-12"></span><span id="page-91-11"></span>When the two chiasms of chapter 7 are compared, the center of each (vv. 9–12 and vv. 19–22) involves judgment on the fourth beast by the Ancient of Days. In the section of interpretation (vv. 15–28), only in verses 19–22 does the title "Ancient of Days" appear. This confirms the writer's intention to match the center of the second chiasm (vv. 19–22) with the center of the first (vv. 9–12).

<span id="page-91-10"></span><span id="page-91-2"></span>This chapter begins with a third-person point of view, but verse 2 to the end is from Daniel's first-person view. His record of the vision and interpretation forms the final Aramaic chapter of the book, and in the chiastic arrangement of the Aramaic section (chs. 2–7), it is significant to note that chapter 7 matches chapter 2 with its vision of four kingdoms followed by everlasting dominion. This match will influence the following argument about what the four beasts mean: the four beasts (ch. 7) and metals (ch. 2) refer to the same four kingdoms:

<span id="page-91-20"></span><span id="page-91-9"></span><span id="page-91-6"></span>Chapter 7 is also a transition to the exclusively visionary section of the book (chs. 7–12). Daniel was the sole recipient of these visions, with no report of a king receiving them first. They incorporate symbols, metaphors, numbers, and cosmic activity. This last half of the book consists of four visions: chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10–12. Each vision occurred in a different year (cf. 7:1; 8:1; 9:1; 10:1) and location (cf. 7:1; 8:27; 9:3, 21; 10:4), but they did not occur chronologically following the events at the end of chapter 6. Rather, the four visions in chapters 7–12 occurred *concurrently with* the events of chapters 1–6 and are given in chronological order (table 1.8). (Note, once again: we are assuming that Darius and Cyrus were the same person.)

| The Vision   | The Year of the Vision                                 | Where Daniel Was       |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Daniel 7     | "the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon" (7:1)   | In his house (7:1)     |
| Daniel 8     | "the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar" (8:1) | In his house (8:27)    |
| Daniel 9     | "the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus" (9:1)  | In his house (9:3, 21) |

<span id="page-91-8"></span><span id="page-91-0"></span>TABLE 1.8: Years and Locations of the Visions of Daniel 7–12

<span id="page-92-15"></span><span id="page-92-0"></span>Since the content of chapter 7 most closely matches the vision in chapter 2, it is worth considering how the remaining visions of the book (chs. 8–12) relate to each other. The visions in chapter 8 and in chapters 10–12 seem to form a frame around chapter 9 in an A-B-A' pattern:

- <span id="page-92-17"></span><span id="page-92-13"></span>A. Daniel 8
	- B. Daniel 9
- <span id="page-92-18"></span>A'. Daniel 10–12

This chiasm is evident as the visions in chapter 8 and in chapters 10–12 address Medo-Persia and Greece and are narrower in scope than the visions in chapters 2 and 7 (which address four kingdoms). Also separating chapters 8–12 from chapter 7 is their language: chapters 8–12 are in Hebrew, while chapter 7 is in Aramaic. Thus, not only do the Aramaic chapters form a chiasm (2–7), but the Hebrew vision-chapters form a chiasm as well (8–12).33

<span id="page-92-9"></span><span id="page-92-3"></span><span id="page-92-1"></span>Chapter 7 does double duty by both completing the Aramaic section of the book (chs. 2–7) and transitioning to the exclusively visionary portion (chs. 7–12). This placement suggests it may be the book's most important chapter. Moreover, when all of the visions and riddles of the book are laid out (chs. 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10–12), they are seven in number, with chapter 7 in the center. This chapter has been described as "the key to understanding the major themes that run throughout the book."34 In the canonical sweep of Scripture, the significance of Daniel 7 is evident in the frequency with which the NT characters/writers make reference to it.35

#### <span id="page-92-6"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-92-11"></span><span id="page-92-10"></span>7:1 Daniel had a vision in "the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon," around 550 BC. Daniel had been in Babylon for more than fifty years and would have been in his late sixties when he received this vision. The vision consists of activity in the sea (vv. 1–8) and in heaven (vv. 9–14). A situation with the fourth beast (vv. 7–8) provokes God's response (vv. 9–14). In verses 1–8, Daniel gives the year of the vision and then describes four beasts that rose up from the sea. The fourth beast receives the most attention (vv. 7–8).

<span id="page-92-12"></span><span id="page-92-4"></span>Belshazzar was the last king of Babylon; the night of his blasphemous banquet was both the night of his death and the night the Medo-Persians seized control of Babylon (5:30–31). In the Aramaic chiasm of the book (chs. 2–7), a comparison of chapters 2 and 7 reveals that the vision in the former occurred under Nebuchadnezzar (2:1), the first king of Judah's exile, while the vision in the latter occurred under Belshazzar (7:1), the last Babylonian king of Judah's exile (cf. 5:31). Thus, during the first and last Babylonian kings of Judah's exile, God gave visions of

<span id="page-92-16"></span><span id="page-92-14"></span><span id="page-92-5"></span><span id="page-92-2"></span><sup>33</sup> For confirmation of the chiasm of Daniel 8–12, see Greidanus, *Preaching Christ from Daniel*, 20; Steinmann, *Daniel*, 25. Goldingay says, "It is with chapter 8 that chapters 10–12 have most detailed points of contact. Reminiscences of almost every verse of chapter 8 reappear here" (*Daniel*, 283).

four earthly kingdoms. Other visions in the book pertain to only some of these kingdoms.

<span id="page-93-2"></span><span id="page-93-1"></span>In chapter 7, even though Belshazzar was king, God gave the vision directly to Daniel (contrast with 2:1 and 4:5, where the king received the dream and subsequently sought interpretation, which Daniel provided). Daniel saw the vision at night, "as he lay in his bed" (cf. 7:2, 7, and 13 for reference to "vision by night" or "night visions"). He then "wrote down the dream," which formed the record of the dream found in verses 2–28.36

<span id="page-93-12"></span><span id="page-93-6"></span><span id="page-93-5"></span><span id="page-93-0"></span>7:2–3 Daniel saw "four winds of heaven" stirring up the great sea. These were winds from the north, south, east, and west. The "sea" was classically viewed as a realm of chaos and disorder (cf. Job 38:8–10; Ps. 104:6–7), and now that realm was pulsing with activity. The winds roused four different beasts from the waters. The origin of the beasts is not contradicted by the interpretation in Daniel 7:17: "These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise *out of the earth*." The beasts arising from the waters in verse 2 were merely a picture of the actual kings, who naturally arose out of the earth, as verse 17 attests. The images of "sea" and "earth" are not contradictory but complementary.37

<span id="page-93-9"></span>Daniel wrote about these beasts in the subsequent verses (vv. 4–8). Each beast was numbered and described, and then some activity is described (table 1.9).

<span id="page-93-3"></span>TABLE 1.9: The Four Beasts of Daniel 7

<span id="page-93-11"></span><span id="page-93-8"></span>7:4 The first beast was "like a lion and had eagles' wings." These beasts are not normal animals but composites of multiple creatures. Since chapters 2 and 7 put forward a series of four kings/empires symbolized by metals and animals (respectively), this first beast must represent Babylon and, most specifically, Nebuchadnezzar.

<sup>36</sup> If the book was a second-century BC composition, as some have said, then the opening of chapter 7 is a lie. Either Daniel really saw a dream and then wrote it down, or he did not. If Daniel, the exile from Judah, did not truly see what 7:2–28 claimed he saw, why should his prophetic word be trusted?

<span id="page-93-13"></span><span id="page-93-7"></span><span id="page-93-4"></span><sup>37</sup> The images of beast, sea, and earth are taken up by the author of Revelation, who in chapter 13 describes "a beast rising out of the sea" (v. 1) and "another beast rising out of the earth" (v. 11). Daniel 7 is the background for those figures in Revelation 13.

<span id="page-94-3"></span><span id="page-94-1"></span><span id="page-94-0"></span>In other OT passages, Nebuchadnezzar was compared to a lion (Jer. 4:7; 50:17) and the Babylonian armies to eagles (Lam. 4:19; Ezek. 17:3; Hab. 1:8), so in Daniel 7:4 the use of "lion" and "eagle" is consistent with terminology used to describe Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon. These images denote predators who can overcome their prey.

As Daniel beheld the eagle-winged lion, three actions took place: "Its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it." The passive verbs suggest divine action, and the three events evoke chapter 4, where King Nebuchadnezzar was given the mind of a beast for a time (4:16, 33); when the allotted punishment was fulfilled, God restored his normal mind (v. 34).38

<span id="page-94-7"></span><span id="page-94-6"></span><span id="page-94-4"></span>7:5 From the chaotic waters rose a second beast, "like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'" If the first metal (gold) and animal (a winged lion) both refer to Babylon in chapters 2 and 7, then the second animal most reasonably corresponds to the second metal—Medo-Persia.

<span id="page-94-9"></span><span id="page-94-2"></span>In the interpretation of Daniel's vision (7:15–28), nothing is made of the bear and rib imagery of verse 5, but the ferocious nature of the beast is clear by the description of its prey's ribs sticking out of its mouth.39 The bear has already devoured, and it is told to devour more. Just as the passive verbs in verse 4 suggested divine action, so also is the command in verse 5 from God. The Medo-Persian Empire was God's instrument for judgment on Babylon and deliverance of his exiled people. The bear would discover how Babylon tasted!

<span id="page-94-8"></span>7:6 Daniel's gaze shifted to a third beast, which looked "like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it." This winged four-headed leopard represented the empire that followed Medo-Persia: the Greeks. The "wings of a bird," as in verse 4, probably represented swiftness. Led by Alexander the Great, the Greeks indeed conquered swiftly.

In the interpretation of the vision (vv. 15–28), the angel does not interpret the meaning of the four heads, so ultimately interpreters cannot be certain. In any case, God's sovereignty is clear once more, as "dominion was given to it." Alexander began his conquest of Persia in 334 BC and in one decade had established a vast empire. The four heads of the leopard may suggest this vast dominance.40

Lion, bear, and leopard imagery also appears in Hosea's prophetic ministry to the northern kingdom of Israel. God used those animal comparisons to describe his judgment on Israel: "I am to them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk beside the way. I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs; I will tear open their breast, and there I will devour them like a lion, as a wild beast would rip them open"

<span id="page-94-5"></span><sup>38</sup> According to Daniel 4:33, during Nebuchadnezzar's punishment his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails grew out like birds' claws.

<sup>39</sup> By 550 BC, Persia had already conquered the Medes.

<sup>40</sup> The four heads may also represent the four generals who received sections of the Greek empire when Alexander died: Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Cassander (cf. Greidanus, *Preaching Christ from Daniel*, 217).

<span id="page-95-13"></span>(Hos. 13:7–8). Pagan empires operate under the sovereign rule of God, who raises up and brings down, and his purposes include judgment—even if pagan empires are his unwitting instruments. God's sovereignty is not contingent on their consent.

<span id="page-95-0"></span>7:7–8 The fourth beast receives almost as much attention as the first three beasts combined, and Daniel and the angel focus on this beast in the interpretation section as well (vv. 19–27). If preceding empires in chapters 2 and 7 were Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece, then the fourth beast (7:7–8) corresponded to the fourth metal (2:33, 40–43) and thus represented Rome.

<span id="page-95-9"></span><span id="page-95-2"></span>The other composite animals (a winged lion, a bear with ribs in its teeth, a winged four-headed leopard) were menacing in Daniel's descriptions, but he highlighted the ferocious nature of the fourth beast even more: "Behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet." This depiction recalls the fourth part of the man of metals in chapter 2, representing a kingdom as "strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these" (2:40). The similarity of 7:7 to 2:40 further confirms a correspondence between the two visions. As one commentator wrote, "Rome showed itself to be the first truly universal empire of antiquity. Rome was characterized by its conquering and crushing power and by its ability to consolidate the territories which it seized."41

<span id="page-95-8"></span><span id="page-95-3"></span>Daniel described the fourth beast as "different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns." This description surpasses those of the previous beasts, who were not pictured as having horns.42 The makeup of this beast also incorporates language used for the previous three. It had feet (7:7), like the first (v. 4); it had something plucked (v. 8), like the first (v. 4); it had teeth (v. 7), like the second (v. 5); it devoured (v. 7), like the second (v. 5); and it exercised relentless dominion (v. 7), like the third (v. 6).

<span id="page-95-10"></span><span id="page-95-7"></span><span id="page-95-6"></span>As Daniel considered the "ten horns" of the beast, "There came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots" (v. 8). This activity is not paralleled by any previous beast (cf. vv. 4–6) nor by any explicit iron/clay connection in chapter 2 (cf. 2:33, 40–43).43 This little horn had "eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things." The first beast was given the mind of a man (7:4), while this fourth beast has the eyes and speech of one. If the beast was truly as fearsome as Daniel described, then the "great things" the little horn was "speaking" were surely alarming. We will consider interpretations of this "little" horn during the exposition of verses 15–28.

<span id="page-95-12"></span><span id="page-95-11"></span><span id="page-95-5"></span>7:9–10 After the stirred sea and rising monsters, Daniel's vision shifted to heaven, where "thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat." It will be clear

<sup>41</sup> Edward Joseph Young, *The Prophecy of Daniel: A Commentary* (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1953), 288.

<span id="page-95-14"></span><span id="page-95-4"></span><span id="page-95-1"></span><sup>42</sup> This image of "ten horns" is probably the source of John's language in Revelation 12:3; 13:1; 17:3, 7, 12, 16. 43 While some readers may identify the "ten horns" with the "ten toes" on the image of Daniel 2, it is worth observing that the vision in Daniel 2 never numbered the toes nor made any significant meaning out of them. So, while the ten horns in Daniel 7 may allude to the ten toes, the connection is uncertain.

<span id="page-96-7"></span><span id="page-96-6"></span><span id="page-96-5"></span>in verse 10 that this is a judgment scene in which Daniel will see a divine response to the little horn. In verses 9–12, the Ancient of Days sat down to render judgment (vv. 9–10), the beast was destroyed (v. 11), and the other beasts' dominion was taken away (v. 12).

<span id="page-96-9"></span><span id="page-96-1"></span>The thrones were for the Ancient of Days and for the soon-to-appear son of man (v. 13). The title "Ancient of Days" refers to God and denotes his eternality. He wore clothing as white as snow and his hair was like pure wool, which conveys purity and wisdom. As righteous judge he sat on his throne of "fiery flames," with wheels of "burning fire" (cf. Ezek. 1:15–21). This description seems to portray God's throne as a chariot; chariots were used by rulers in the ancient Near East as vehicles of conquest and victory. The little horn may have been "speaking great things" (Dan. 7:8), but the Ancient of Days would soon conquer (v. 11). From his fiery throne-chariot "a stream of fire issued and came out from before him." This flame-stream represented holy judgment pouring forth from the throne.

<span id="page-96-4"></span>Daniel next described those surrounding this scene: "A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him" (v. 10). These were probably angels, functioning here as heavenly worshipers. Daniel was trying not to be numerically precise but to indicate their innumerability.

As the angels stood in the presence of the judge, "The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened." This language confirms that the Ancient of Days sat on his fiery chariot-throne for the purpose of rendering a righteous judgment from the heavenly courtroom. The "books" were most likely the record of deeds spoken of elsewhere in Scripture (cf. Ex. 32:32–33; Pss. 56:8; 69:28; 139:16). God knows perfectly the deeds of everyone, including the wicked little horn and the other beasts.

<span id="page-96-0"></span>7:11 As this scene was taking place, Daniel heard "the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking." At the same time, "The beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire." This action reflects a fulfillment of the judgment rendered from the throne, from which the stream of fire had poured forth (vv. 9–10).

<span id="page-96-8"></span>7:12 Not only did God judge the little horn, he also removed dominion from the other beasts. God is sovereign, and he may give or take away dominion whenever he chooses. "Rest of the beasts" may be a reference to the "ten horns," since in verse 11 it appears that a horn can also be considered a "beast" in an individual sense. If this is true, then God judged both the little horn ("the beast"; v. 11) and the other ten horns ("the rest of the beasts"; v. 12). It is plausible, however, that in light of the opening verses of chapter 7, the "rest of the beasts" are the three that rose from the sea in verses 4–6 and the "beast" killed in verse 11 is the "fourth beast" (v. 7).

<span id="page-96-2"></span>In favor of viewing "the rest of the beasts" as individuals constituting the larger corporate fourth beast is that "their lives were prolonged for a season and a time" (v. 12).44 Even though the little horn was judged in a way that implied his

<span id="page-96-3"></span><sup>44</sup> If the "rest of the beasts" (v. 12) are the first three that rose from the sea (vv. 4–6), then the phrase "their lives were prolonged for a season and a time" probably refers to people of one empire who were absorbed into another.

<span id="page-97-10"></span>destruction (cf. v. 11), the "rest of the beasts" (the "ten horns" in the interpretation suggested here) were not immediately destroyed in like manner. "A season and a time," while not precise, suggests the temporariness of their prolonged lives.

<span id="page-97-2"></span>7:13 In Daniel's night vision, "with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him." This figure is described with a simile ("like a son of man"), as were the four beasts (vv. 4–8). The phrase "son of man" recalls passages like Psalm 8:3–4, where the creation story is evoked, in particular the creation of man (cf. Gen. 1:26–31; 2:7). The psalmist addresses God, stating that he created man

<span id="page-97-1"></span> a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet. (Ps. 8:5–6)

<span id="page-97-12"></span><span id="page-97-11"></span><span id="page-97-3"></span><span id="page-97-0"></span>The phrase "son of man" should be understood against this backdrop—just as Adam was given dominion over the beasts (Gen. 1:26–28), so was this son of man. He came to the Ancient of Days (Dan. 7:13) to receive dominion over everything (v. 14)—even the beasts (vv. 4–8)!—and his dominion would be everlasting, whereas theirs was temporary. This "one" who "came to the Ancient of Days" was like a new Adam.

<span id="page-97-5"></span><span id="page-97-4"></span>He came "with the clouds of heaven," denoting glory and deity (cf. Ps. 18:11–14; Isa. 19:1; Ezek. 32:7–8; Joel 2:1–2; Nah. 1:2–8; Zeph. 1:14–15). In the OT, God's presence in a cloud denoted glory, judgment, and vindication. So when "one like a son of man" came "with the clouds of heaven" to the "Ancient of Days," the scene as a whole denoted both glory and deity.

7:14 To the one like a son of man "was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him." The dominion was total and would never be revoked: "His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."

<span id="page-97-9"></span><span id="page-97-7"></span>This connection of "one like a son of man" to a "kingdom" parallels chapter 2, where "a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces" (2:34), and "the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth" (2:35). This stone represented "a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever" (2:44). In both chapter 2 and chapter 7, four temporary earthly kingdoms are followed by God's everlasting kingdom, and thus the "stone" of 2:34–35 is paralleled by the "one like a son of man" of 7:13.

<span id="page-97-8"></span><span id="page-97-6"></span>Daniel 7:13–14 constitutes one of the most important passages for authors of the NT. In the Gospels, Jesus took his most-used title, "Son of Man," from this passage.

<span id="page-98-21"></span><span id="page-98-20"></span><span id="page-98-19"></span><span id="page-98-15"></span><span id="page-98-13"></span>7:15 Framed by admissions of alarm (vv. 15, 28), Daniel received brief interpretation from an angel (vv. 16–18), desired to know more about the fourth beast and its horns (vv. 19–22), and heard the angel elaborate on these aspects of the vision (vv. 23–27). First, Daniel confessed his anxious spirit (v. 15). The beasts from the sea were frightening enough, and apparently the heavenly judgment scene and the one like a son of man did nothing to relieve Daniel's fear. Indeed, the fiery throne-chariot and the figure coming "with the clouds of heaven" may have overwhelmed him with their majesty and glory. Daniel's fearful response echoes the earlier reactions of Nebuchadnezzar (2:1, 3; 4:5) and Belshazzar (5:6).

<span id="page-98-14"></span><span id="page-98-11"></span><span id="page-98-4"></span><span id="page-98-1"></span>7:16 Unlike in chapters 2, 4, and 5, in chapter 7 Daniel must seek out an interpretation for his own vision. He approached "one of those who stood there," probably an angel among the countless host who were serving the Ancient of Days, and "asked him the truth concerning all this." These angels "stood before" God (v. 10), and the one Daniel approached remains unnamed, although 9:21 probably helps readers in hindsight to identify him as Gabriel. When Daniel asked for the truth concerning the visions, the angel provided an interpretation.

<span id="page-98-22"></span><span id="page-98-17"></span><span id="page-98-16"></span><span id="page-98-5"></span>7:17 Though the angel's words in verses 17–18 are not elaborate, they distill the main point of the monsters in the sea (v. 17) and the judgment and vindication in heaven (v. 18). The four great beasts were four kings who would arise. This summarizes the point of verses 1–8 and confirms that a "beast" could function in either a corporate or an individual sense. "Out of the earth" confirms their human nature. Understood in parallel with chapter 2, these "four kings" would be part of kingdoms in a certain order. Since each of the kingdoms would have more than one king as future events unfolded, the reference to "four kings" indicates that one king from each kingdom was particularly in view (table 1.10).

<span id="page-98-0"></span>TABLE 1.10: Kings and Kingdoms of Daniel 2 and 7

<span id="page-98-18"></span><span id="page-98-12"></span><span id="page-98-10"></span><span id="page-98-9"></span><span id="page-98-8"></span><span id="page-98-3"></span>7:18 The angel's interpretation summarized the point of the heavenly courtroom vision (vv. 9–14). The angel spoke of a kingdom that would be possessed forever, specifying "the saints of the Most High" as the ones who "shall receive" it. Unexpectedly, the singular "one like a son of man" who possessed the kingdom in verses 13–14 is now replaced by the plural "saints" in verse 18. Thus Daniel

saw the actualization of the vindication of God's people. The kingdoms of the world were conquered, and God's people had received an everlasting kingdom and would exercise dominion like Adam, whose creation mandate they still stewarded.

<span id="page-99-9"></span><span id="page-99-4"></span>As the NT writers demonstrate by quoting Jesus' self-description as the "Son of Man" (Matt. 8:20; 9:6; 24:30; cf. Rev. 1:7, 13), the "saints" of Daniel 7:18 do not completely fulfill Daniel's vision of "one like a son of man" in verse 13. That figure "came to the Ancient of Days" and did so "with the clouds of heaven," an encounter and status fit for deity. Furthermore, "all peoples, nations, and languages" would "serve" the "one like a son of man," and since no mere human is worthy of worship, only a divine person could warrant and rightly command this global homage.

<span id="page-99-10"></span><span id="page-99-5"></span><span id="page-99-0"></span>Just as Jesus is the stone of chapter 2 that will inaugurate God's everlasting kingdom, so he is the Son of Man who will be given authority over all things and an everlasting dominion that "shall not pass away" (7:14). In God's wise redemptive plan, believers are also stones used by God to build a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5), as well as "one like a son of man" who will receive God's everlasting kingdom. In the light of progressive and canonical revelation, it becomes clear that only in union with the last Adam can the saints faithfully and truly exercise their God-assigned dominion. Because the Son of Man possessed the kingdom, the saints shall possess it forever as well.

<span id="page-99-7"></span><span id="page-99-6"></span><span id="page-99-2"></span>7:19–20 In verses 19–22, Daniel specified what he wanted to know more about: the fourth beast, the ten horns, and the "other horn" (vv. 19–20), as well as what the other horn did that led to its judgment (vv. 21–22). Daniel's language about the fourth beast echoes verses 7–8, for in verse 19 he described it as "different from all the rest," "exceedingly terrifying," having "teeth of iron," and a beast "which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet" (cf. v. 7). Not found in the earlier vision of the turbulent sea, however, is the detail about the fourth beast's "claws of bronze," a detail observed only in verse 19. The order of teeth, claws, and feet in verse 19 correspond to the verbs of devouring, breaking, and stamping, respectively. The fourth beast was ferocious and altogether terrible.

<span id="page-99-3"></span><span id="page-99-1"></span>Daniel desired to know not only about the fourth beast but also about "the ten horns that were on its head" (v. 20; cf. v. 8). He wanted more information about "the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell," which was the horn with the eyes and mouth (cf. v. 8). In verse 8 he had said that "three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots," but in verse 20 he observed that "three of them fell" before the little/other horn. To Daniel this horn "seemed greater than its companions" (v. 20), the other horns. The little horn seemed greater perhaps because it spoke great things or because three horns fell before it.

<span id="page-99-8"></span>7:21–22 The greatness of the little horn was displayed amid war against God's people. Since such opposition was not attributed to previous beasts, this probably <span id="page-100-9"></span>explains Daniel's focus on the fourth beast and its little horn. This horn opposed God's people and appeared victorious—that is, "until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom" (v. 22). The "great things" the horn's mouth was speaking (cf. vv. 8, 20) were probably blasphemous boasts that God would not tolerate.

<span id="page-100-6"></span><span id="page-100-5"></span><span id="page-100-4"></span>The title "Ancient of Days" recalls the courtroom scene in which God took his seat to render judgment from his fiery throne-chariot (vv. 9–10). The destruction of the beast/horn (v. 11) meant vindication for God's people, especially as they received the everlasting kingdom (vv. 13–14), and thus judgment on the little horn was on behalf of the saints as well. The horn had prevailed over the saints (v. 21), but now the Ancient of Days prevailed over the horn (v. 22).

<span id="page-100-13"></span><span id="page-100-10"></span><span id="page-100-8"></span><span id="page-100-2"></span>7:23 The angel addressed the fourth beast (v. 23), the ten horns (v. 24), and the little horn's blasphemous activity and divine judgment (vv. 25–27). The angel declared that the fourth beast (cf. vv. 7–8) "shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces." Most of this information was not new, for what Daniel had seen (v. 19) indicated that the fourth beast was fearsome, destructive, and engaged in devouring and stamping. However, here the beast was said to "devour the whole earth," denoting its vast dominion.

<span id="page-100-11"></span><span id="page-100-7"></span>7:24 The angel then interpreted the ten horns: "Out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise." The ten kings represent not ten different kingdoms but rulers within the same kingdom (Rome). However, scholars disagree whether "ten" is literal or symbolic.

<span id="page-100-3"></span>Another horn would arise after these ten, "different from the former ones, . . . [to] put down three kings." Since the horns represented kings, the other horn that arose surely represented a king as well. The text has stated that three kings were "put down" (v. 24), "fell" (v. 20), and "were plucked up by the roots" (v. 8). The different verbs make it challenging to conclude what happened to the kings, although the images suggest death by the little horn's hand or decree.

<span id="page-100-12"></span><span id="page-100-0"></span>7:25 At the center of the action of the fourth beast's little horn was opposition to God and his people. The "mouth speaking great things" (vv. 8, 11, 20) blasphemed God, speaking "words against the Most High." The title "Most High" or "Most High God" appeared earlier, in chapters 4 and 5 (4:17, 24, 25, 32, 34; 5:18, 21), which reported God's judgments on Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, and now the appearance of "Most High" in chapter 7 is likewise in a context of judgment.

<span id="page-100-1"></span>The notion of "wear[ing] out the saints" implies a longer period of trial for God's people, a season requiring endurance and faithfulness. The little horn "shall think to change the times and the law," which would affect God's people negatively. "The times" may reflect Jewish festivals prescribed in "the law." No matter how dire the situation seemed for God's people, however, God remained sovereign, for the saints "shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time"; the passive verb suggests a divine act. The horn, like everything and everyone, remained subject to the Most High. The saints may have been in the hand of the horn, but the saints and the horn were both in the hand of God.

The specific period of opposition is much debated. If "time" equals one year, then "a time, times, and half a time" would denote three and a half years. Even if that were true, it is not certain whether the period should be taken literally or figuratively. What is clear in any case is that the blasphemous activity of the little horn had a divinely established expiration date.

<span id="page-101-19"></span><span id="page-101-7"></span>7:26 The Most High judged the little horn. The angel declared, "The court shall sit in judgment," referring to the Ancient of Days taking his seat on his fiery thronechariot (vv. 9–10). The removal of dominion and statement of destruction recall the event of verse 11; God had granted dominion and then took it away.

<span id="page-101-20"></span><span id="page-101-15"></span><span id="page-101-10"></span><span id="page-101-0"></span>7:27 God's judgment on the little horn had implications for the saints, just as Daniel had seen in verse 22. The angel promised, "The kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High." Persecution would not be the last word for the saints! They would be vindicated, and their dominion would exceed that of any earthly beast. With a view toward fulfilling the creation mandate in Genesis 1, the saints would exercise dominion over everything "under the whole heaven." This role of the saints does not undermine or exclude the greater rule of God Most High. In contrast to the previous beast kingdoms, God's kingdom would be everlasting, "and all dominions shall serve and obey him."

<span id="page-101-4"></span>Having reached the end of the vision and its interpretation (Dan. 7:2–27), we should observe the seven subjects of the vision and how they were described by the angel in his interpretation. As is evident in table 1.11, some aspects of the vision were mentioned multiple times:

<span id="page-101-17"></span><span id="page-101-16"></span><span id="page-101-14"></span><span id="page-101-13"></span><span id="page-101-12"></span><span id="page-101-9"></span><span id="page-101-5"></span><span id="page-101-3"></span>

<span id="page-101-2"></span>TABLE 1.11: The Seven Subjects of the Vision of Daniel 7

<span id="page-101-18"></span><span id="page-101-11"></span><span id="page-101-8"></span><span id="page-101-6"></span><span id="page-101-1"></span>Since the metals in chapter 2 represented kingdoms in a certain order (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome), and since chapter 7 matches chapter 2, it is reasonable to compare the fourth elements of each chapter in order to interpret the vision's details in light of later history, especially in light of how NT authors make use of texts from these chapters.

<span id="page-102-13"></span><span id="page-102-10"></span><span id="page-102-2"></span><span id="page-102-1"></span>In Luke 20:17–18, Jesus understands himself to be the prophesied stone of Daniel 2:34. Jesus ministered, died, and was resurrected during the reign of Rome (the empire represented in the fourth part of the visions in chapters 2 and 7). But the promise in 2:35—"The stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth"—is still being completed, for all enemies are still being put in subjection to Christ, including the last enemy, death (1 Cor. 15:25–26). Jesus inaugurated the dominion/kingdom of God (Matt. 4:17), which has grown over time (cf. Matt. 13:31–33). The fulfillment of Daniel 2, then, did not occur in an instant in Jesus' ministry. Instead, his ministry introduced an already-but-not-yet reality to be consummated at his return. All the while, God's kingdom remains everlasting.

<span id="page-102-8"></span><span id="page-102-7"></span><span id="page-102-6"></span><span id="page-102-3"></span><span id="page-102-0"></span>Jesus' most common self-description was "Son of Man," alluding to Daniel 7 (e.g., Matt. 8:20; 9:6). He alluded to Daniel 7:13 when telling the high priest, "I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Matt. 26:64). Jesus was the "one like a son of man" from Daniel 7:13, and thus he would receive everlasting dominion and authority. This is reflected in his post-resurrection words to his disciples, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matt. 28:18). Later he ascended to the Father, where he sat down at God's right hand until his enemies were made his footstool (cf. Heb. 1:13). This Jesus, the risen and enthroned Son of God, reigns now.

<span id="page-102-17"></span><span id="page-102-16"></span><span id="page-102-15"></span><span id="page-102-14"></span><span id="page-102-9"></span><span id="page-102-4"></span>When John sees a vision of Jesus in Revelation 1:12–18, he describes him using the same kind of language used for the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7:9–10 (cf. Rev. 1:14), because the Father and the Son are divine persons, and thus what can be said of the Father in this case can be said also of the Son. When John writes of a heavenly throne scene in Revelation 5, he declares that the Lion of the tribe of Judah "has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals" (Rev. 5:5), and when John looks, he sees "a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain" (v. 6). This triumphant Christ came to the one on the throne and took the scroll (v. 7), and rejoicing commenced (vv. 8–14). Like the scene in Daniel 7:10, there were multitudes of angels around the throne, ascribing power and might to Jesus (Rev. 5:11–12). John depicts the scene in Revelation 5 using the imagery of Daniel 7 to convey that the "one like a son of man" (Dan. 7:13) has received authority by taking the scroll from the Ancient of Days.

<span id="page-102-19"></span><span id="page-102-18"></span><span id="page-102-12"></span><span id="page-102-11"></span><span id="page-102-5"></span>The triumph of Christ is good news for God's people. In one sense, the saints receive the kingdom through their union with Christ, for Paul teaches that they are heirs of all things with Christ (Rom. 8:16–17; Gal. 4:4–7; Eph. 1:11–14; 3:6). As true children of Abraham and thus children of the promise, believers will inherit the world (Rom. 4:13–17). Yet, as we survey the world around us and recognize the persistent unglorified state of our bodies and the manifold effects of the curse on creation, it is clear we have not received all that has been promised. The victorious stone that becomes a mountain, the Son of Man who subjects his enemies, is operating and reigning between inauguration and consummation. Nonetheless, what John heard about the Lamb in the throne room is true now: "You were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth" (Rev. 5:9–10).

<span id="page-103-13"></span><span id="page-103-11"></span><span id="page-103-8"></span><span id="page-103-3"></span>Daniel was not given enough information to know the identity of the fourth beast, its ten horns, or the little horn, but later Scripture may shed some light on this question. In Revelation 13 a beast rises out of the sea "with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads" (Rev. 13:1).45 Note the presence of ten horns and the tone of blasphemy associated with this "beast." John even describes it with animal characteristics: "The beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth" (Rev. 13:2). These animals allude to Daniel 7:4–6, with John naming the animals in reverse order. John (like Daniel) then gives attention to its mouth: "The beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months" (Rev. 13:5; cf. Dan. 7:8, 11, 20). Even the period of time—"forty-two months"—matches the "time, times, and half a time" of Daniel 7:25 if a single "time" equals one year, because forty-two months equal three and a half years. During this time the beast "was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them" (Rev. 13:7), recalling the terrible opposition inflicted on the saints by the little horn (Dan. 7:21, 25).

<span id="page-103-14"></span><span id="page-103-6"></span><span id="page-103-5"></span><span id="page-103-4"></span><span id="page-103-0"></span>If John wrote the Apocalypse before AD 70, the little horn may have been Nero or perhaps Vespasian. If John wrote his Apocalypse after 70, then perhaps Domitian was the little horn; or, if the referent was not to a first-century figure, perhaps a future antichrist may yet embody the title and deeds of the little horn. In addition, parts of the vision and interpretation in Daniel 7 may have combined future events that, as history unfolds, are separated and fulfilled in stages of inauguration, interim, and consummation. At the end of Revelation, John reports seeing a future day when God will sit in judgment of everyone (Rev. 20:11–15). Ultimately any earthly judgment on an earthly kingdom (such as Rome) is but a foreshadowing of the final day of the Lord, when eternal states will be dispensed. Any judgment on God's enemies (such as the little horn) anticipates the day when God will cast the dragon, who is behind earthly opposition to Christ and his people (Rev. 12:3, 17; 13:2), into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10).

<span id="page-103-15"></span><span id="page-103-10"></span><span id="page-103-9"></span><span id="page-103-7"></span><span id="page-103-2"></span>7:28 After recording the angelic interpreter's words, Daniel wrote, "Here is the end of the matter," forming an inclusio with the beginning of the chapter (v. 1) and signaling the completion of what he had seen and heard. In accord with the fearsome nature of the beast and the terror the saints would endure, he admits, "My thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter

<span id="page-103-12"></span><span id="page-103-1"></span><sup>45</sup> Daniel 7 reported four beasts, the first of which represented the empire in power when Daniel saw the vision—Babylon. In Revelation 13, John sees only one beast coming out of the sea because the previous beasts of Daniel 7 (representing Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece) had already come and gone in history.

<span id="page-104-1"></span>in my heart." Despite being informed that the saints would be vindicated and God's kingdom would be established, Daniel still feared, and his alarm was evident in his discoloration. (This response forms an inclusio with the beginning of the interpretation section; cf. v. 15.) Both the vision and its interpretation had left Daniel deeply unsettled, but he continued to ponder what he saw and what the angel said (cf. Luke 2:19).

#### <span id="page-104-4"></span>*Response*

Because of events that occurred long after the writing of the book of Daniel, we need not share the prophet's response of alarm. Even though persecution still takes place in this world, the people of God should rejoice that Jesus Christ, the triumphant and reigning Son of Man, is enthroned in heaven, subjecting all enemies under his feet. The enemies of Christ may seem fierce—in fact, in Daniel's description of the beasts, especially the fourth, they can seem too mighty and vicious to contend with—but the Son of Man has dominion over them.

<span id="page-104-8"></span><span id="page-104-7"></span>Chapter 7 reminds us that the victory of the saints is inseparably tied to the victory of the Son of Man. The responsibility of the people of God is not to achieve victory but to live in light of Christ's victory. The saints conquer the Accuser "by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death" (Rev. 12:11). The call to the saints is one of endurance (cf. Rev. 13:10). Their faithful testimony may lead to their martyrdom, and thus it may appear that they have been conquered, but a feature of apocalyptic literature is the unmasking of worldly and heavenly realities. The dragon may rage against God's people, but when the veil is pulled back, his raging cannot reverse the victory Christ has secured through his death and resurrection.

<span id="page-104-2"></span>The details of apocalyptic literature may present challenges, but the imaginative effects of its language should not be downplayed as hopelessly muddled. After the vision of the Ancient of Days judging the horn and of the Son of Man receiving everlasting dominion, the angel boldly declared, "the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever" (Dan. 7:18). As the old hermeneutical adage goes, do not miss the forest for the trees! God has an everlasting kingdom for his people. Also unmistakable in chapter 7 is the role of God as judge, and not just the end-time judge. He serves as judge now. Empires and their kings do not rule independently of God but exist under his meticulous sovereignty. Believers, therefore, should be full of hope that the last word of the ages belongs to the Most High.

<span id="page-104-6"></span><span id="page-104-5"></span><span id="page-104-3"></span><span id="page-104-0"></span>Our hope in God should affect our prayers. Jesus taught his disciples to pray, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:9–10). In the vision and interpretation of Daniel 7, it is clear that God's heavenly plan will be done on earth. Jesus, the Son of Man, is our high priest in heaven who sympathizes with our weaknesses (cf. Heb. 4:14–15), and there is strength for us at the throne of grace as we draw near to God through him (Heb. 4:16). The Son of Man of Daniel 7 has become our mediator to the Father. Believers can confidently approach the Father because of the victorious work of Christ the Son.

<span id="page-105-1"></span><span id="page-105-0"></span>The culmination of our response to the reality of Daniel 7 should be worship, and no words are more fitting than John's concerning Jesus in Revelation 1:5–6: "To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."

## DANIEL 8:1–27

8In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. **2**And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the citadel, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal. **<sup>3</sup>** I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. **<sup>4</sup>** I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.

**<sup>5</sup>**As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. **6**He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath. **<sup>7</sup>** I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. **8**Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.

**<sup>9</sup>**Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. **<sup>10</sup>** It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some*<sup>1</sup>* of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. **<sup>11</sup>** It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. **12**And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression,*<sup>2</sup>* and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper. **13**Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, "For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?" **14**And he said to me,*<sup>3</sup>* "For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state."

**<sup>15</sup>**When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. **<sup>16</sup>**And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision." **<sup>17</sup>** So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, "Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."

**<sup>18</sup>**And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up. **19**He said, "Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end. **20**As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. **21**And the goat*<sup>4</sup>* is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king. **22**As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his*<sup>5</sup>* nation, but not with his power. **23**And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise. **24**His power shall be great—but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints. **<sup>25</sup>**By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken—but by no human hand. **26**The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now."

**<sup>27</sup>**And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-106-2"></span><span id="page-106-1"></span><span id="page-106-0"></span>Daniel sees a vision of a one-horned goat trampling a two-horned ram (8:3–7). As the goat becomes greater, four horns replace its single horn, and from one of them a little horn grows exceedingly great and tramples the host of heaven and the sanctuary (vv. 8–14). Gabriel interprets the vision for Daniel: the ram is Medo-Persia and the goat is Greece (vv. 16, 20–21). The four horns on the goat are four kingdoms that will arise, and from one of these will come a bold king of great power who will assault and devastate the saints (vv. 22–25).

<span id="page-107-6"></span><span id="page-107-0"></span>Viewing the chapter as a whole, verses 1–2 and verse 27 form an inclusio around the vision and interpretation (vv. 3–26). In verses 1–2 Daniel specifies the year of the current king's reign and reports seeing a vision. In verse 27 he continues the king's business and reports his reaction to the vision.

<span id="page-107-1"></span>In verses 1–14, sections a and a' introduce visual and auditory elements. Daniel sees a vision (a) and hears angels discussing it (a'). In the vision, the ram first becomes great (b) and then the little horn on the goat becomes exceedingly great (b'). By viewing b and b' together, the interpreter sees the superiority of the little horn. Sections c and c' focus on the goat. In c there is only one conspicuous horn, but in c' there are four. In the center of the chiastic vision, Daniel sees the goat defeat the ram (d). Being centrally placed, this defeat is significant.

The second part of the chapter interprets the vision (vv. 15–27). In the frame of the inclusio (a and a'), Daniel apparently does not understand the vision. Sections b and b' clarify why Daniel's confusion is reasonable and acceptable, for the vision pertains to events far beyond his own lifetime. In the next matching pair, an angel speaks of a future "indignation" (c) and a malicious little horn (c'), two interrelated issues. The center of the interpretation chiasm is an identification of the ram and goat (d). The angel specifies that the ram is the kings of Media and Persia (v. 20), while the goat is the king of Greece (v. 21).

<span id="page-107-5"></span>In comparing the first (vv. 1–14) and second (vv. 15–27) chiasms, their centers (vv. 6–7 and vv. 20–21) create an important association, for in verses 6–7 the goat defeats a ram and in verses 20–21 the angel identifies what the animals symbolize in this defeat.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-108-3"></span><span id="page-108-1"></span><span id="page-108-0"></span>8:1 Daniel saw the vision in "the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar," approximately 548 BC. The vision of chapter 7 also occurred during Belshazzar's reign, during his first year (7:1). Daniel referred to the vision in chapter 7 by declaring that the vision in chapter 8 occurred "after that which appeared to me at the first" (8:1). As in chapter 7, Daniel recounts the chapter 8 vision in the first person.

<span id="page-108-9"></span><span id="page-108-4"></span><span id="page-108-2"></span>8:2 In the vision Daniel was "in Susa the citadel, which is the province of Elam." Susa was two hundred miles east of Babylon. Since in verse 27 Daniel states that he rose to go about "the king's business," he must have been physically present in Babylon during this vision; his going to Susa was only visionary. While Babylon ruled Susa for a time, eventually the Persians took it over and used it as a winter residence for their kings. Significantly, then, "In this vision Daniel was transported away from Babylon toward the next world empire, the Medo-Persian Empire."46 In the vision, Daniel was "at the Ulai canal" (v. 2), which ran near Susa and to the northeast. This body of water will be a feature in the vision's ensuing animal activity.

<span id="page-108-5"></span>8:3 The introduction of a beast—a ram—into the vision recalls the use of beasts in chapter 7. The reader, therefore, should be prepared to view the beast as representative of an empire or its king. The ram stood on the bank of the canal, bearing "two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last." These high but uneven horns represented "the kings of Media and Persia" (v. 20), so the ram represented Medo-Persia itself. This identification of this animal is consistent with its appearance beside the Ulai Canal, a body of water near the city of Susa, which would have been ruled by the Medo-Persians.

<span id="page-108-8"></span><span id="page-108-6"></span>8:4 The ram charged in three directions—west, north, and south. It did not charge to the east because it came from the east and sought to conquer in all other directions.47 The ram prevailed, for "no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power." Later in the chapter Gabriel does not interpret this part of the vision, but it probably depicted the force and success of the Medo-Persian expansion. In 539 BC (about nine years after this prophecy) the empire's conquests, led by Cyrus the Persian, would include Babylon and King Belshazzar—the empire seemed unstoppable. Indeed, the ram "did as he pleased and became great." According to Andrew Steinmann, "The power of the Medo-Persian Empire was such that it was the unquestioned authority in the Near East for about two centuries (550–331 BC)."48

<span id="page-108-7"></span>8:5 Daniel signaled ("behold") the introduction of a "male goat," which "came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground." Since the

<sup>46</sup> Greidanus, *Preaching Christ from Daniel*, 271.

<sup>47</sup> As Stephen Miller puts it, "Medo-Persia made most of its conquests in these directions. To the west it subdued Babylonia, Syria, Asia Minor, and made raids upon Greece; to the north—Armenia, Scythia, and the Caspian Sea region; to the south—Egypt and Ethiopia" (Stephen R. Miller, *Daniel*, NAC 18 [Nashville: Broadman & Holman, 1994], 222).

<sup>48</sup> Steinmann, *Daniel*, 399.

ram had charged westward, while the male goat came from the west, one would expect a collision. The goat's levitation indicates a superior beast, or at least one traveling very rapidly. It had "a conspicuous horn between his eyes," representing a king, just as the ram's two horns represented "the kings of Media and Persia" (v. 20). According to Gabriel, "the goat is the king of Greece" and "the great horn between his eyes is the first king" (v. 21). This horn was thus Alexander the Great.

<span id="page-109-11"></span><span id="page-109-10"></span><span id="page-109-7"></span><span id="page-109-6"></span><span id="page-109-0"></span>8:6–7 Daniel watched the one-horned goat charge the two-horned ram with the wrath of war. The goat "struck the ram and broke his two horns," and the ram could not withstand him. Instead, the goat "cast him down to the ground and trampled on him." The ram was utterly defeated. What was spoken earlier about the ram's conquests (v. 4) was now said of the goat's victory over the ram: "There was no one who could rescue the ram from his power" (v. 7). Gabriel does not interpret verses 6–7, but the prophecy was fulfilled in 331 BC when the Medo-Persians fell to Greece, led by Alexander the Great. "The Persians never won a major battle against Alexander. His three decisive victories at Granicus (334 BC), Issus (333 BC), and Arbela (331 BC) destroyed Persian dominance in only three years."49

<span id="page-109-4"></span>8:8 As a result of these conquests, the goat became great, but its horn was then broken, which probably refers to Alexander's death in 323 BC. Following the broken horn, "there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven." The Greek Empire was still in view, only now with different rulers. It is well established that, following Alexander's death, his two sons were murdered and his conquered lands were divided among four generals: Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy. These generals were probably the "four conspicuous horns" that arose on the goat. The "four winds of heaven" denote the vast dominion of the Greek Empire.

<span id="page-109-9"></span><span id="page-109-8"></span>8:9–10 The remainder of Daniel's vision pertained to a little horn and the consequences and aftermath of its malice. If the four horns of verse 8 represented four generals who would steward the territory of Alexander's conquests, then the opening words of verse 9, "Out of one of them came a little horn," would suggest that the "little horn" descended from one of these generals. Just as each of the four horns in verse 8 denoted a person, so the little horn of verse 9 was an individual person.

<span id="page-109-5"></span><span id="page-109-2"></span><span id="page-109-1"></span>Since 7:8 also spoke of a little horn, interpreters must address whether the little horns of chapters 7 and 8 are identical. A previous conclusion, however, prevents us from equating them: the four beasts of 7:1–8 represented Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, while the beasts of 8:3–7 represented Medo-Persia and Greece. When viewed parallel to each other, the visions of chapters 7 and 8 report a "little horn" arising from different empires (table 1.12).

<span id="page-109-3"></span>The little horn of chapter 7 arose during the reign of the fourth beast (Rome), while the little horn of chapter 8 arose during the reign of the third beast (Greece). Since the two little horns are not equivalent yet bear similar depictions (7:8, 21; <span id="page-110-11"></span>8:9–12, 23–25), their relationship might be best described as typological: the little horn from the Greek Empire would be a type, or foreshadowing, of the little horn from the Roman Empire (who, we have suggested, could have been one of several Roman emperors, or even a future antichrist).

TABLE 1.12: Different "Little Horns"? Comparing the Visions of Daniel 7 and 8

<span id="page-110-14"></span><span id="page-110-10"></span><span id="page-110-9"></span><span id="page-110-7"></span><span id="page-110-6"></span><span id="page-110-5"></span>Daniel saw the little horn of 8:9 become "exceedingly great" toward the south and east and toward "the glorious land." This spread of dominion encroached upon territory the Jews would have interpreted as their Promised Land (cf. 11:16, 41, where the title "glorious land" is repeated). It sounded an ominous tone, suggesting a conflict with God's people. Although the individual denoted by the little horn may have had an insignificant beginning, his "growth" refers to his intimidating expansion of power and indomitable conquering spirit.

<span id="page-110-2"></span>The ominous tone increased in volume with the words of 8:10: the little horn "grew great, even to the host of heaven." This ruler was indeed a force to be reckoned with! He caused conflict with the "host of heaven," a phrase sometimes referring to the stars in the heavens (cf. Isa. 40:26). As the little horn reached for the stars, his arrogance was on display. He strove for a status of which no mere man is worthy. And since God was the creator of the stars in the heavens, the actions of the little horn were ultimately against God himself.

<span id="page-110-15"></span><span id="page-110-13"></span><span id="page-110-12"></span>But the "host of heaven" probably symbolized the saints of God as well, for Daniel reported that "some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled" (Dan. 8:10), and the interpretation of this event is that the little horn shall "destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints" (v. 24). Trampling the heavenly host, then, is equivalent to prevailing over the saints. Initially, the association of stars with saints may seem unusual, but later in 12:3 it is said that the resurrected saints "shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; . . . like the stars forever and ever." Speaking of the saints as "the host of heaven" (8:10) evoked the glory and abundance of God's people. After all, God had told Abraham that his descendants would exceed the number of stars in the sky (Gen. 15:5; 22:17).

<span id="page-110-1"></span><span id="page-110-0"></span>The imagery of trampling underfoot implies the defeat of the host. According to Genesis 3:15, the seed of the serpent's offspring would be at enmity with the woman's offspring, and this hostility manifested itself whenever the opponents of <span id="page-111-4"></span>God came against his people. Because the seed of the woman experienced defeat in Daniel 8:10, for the moment it may have seemed as if the promise of Genesis 3:15 had been reversed.

<span id="page-111-2"></span><span id="page-111-0"></span>8:11–12 The arrogance of the little horn knew no bounds. He continued to elevate himself, "even as great as the Prince of the host" (v. 11). If the "host" refers to God's people—the saints—then "Prince of the host" probably refers to their leader. A previous context of conquest may be helpful in interpreting the title: in Joshua 5:14–15, Joshua encountered "the commander of the army of the Lord," before whom Joshua fell in worship and removed his sandals. This commander or prince of God's army was probably the angel of Yahweh, a figure distinct from other created angels and perhaps equivalent to the preincarnate second person of the Trinity. In Daniel 8:11, then, the blasphemous little horn sought to become great like the divine Prince of God's people.

<span id="page-111-7"></span><span id="page-111-5"></span><span id="page-111-1"></span>The little horn disrupted temple worship. The daily sacrifices (cf. Ex. 29:38–42 for the morning and evening offerings) were impeded and the sanctuary overthrown. According to Daniel 8:12, the little horn did these things "because of transgression," suggesting his actions were some kind of judgment. But whose transgression was in view? Most likely the Jews', God's covenant people, who provoked him with their covenant-breaking ways.

<span id="page-111-3"></span>When Daniel saw this vision, the temple had already been destroyed in 586 BC—by the Babylonian army. If Daniel's vision consisted of the "glorious land" (v. 9) and Jews in that land (v. 10) offering regular sacrifices at the temple (v. 11), then the fulfillment of his vision must have occurred after the return from exile and the rebuilding of the Jerusalem temple. This news was thus both good and bad: good, because God's people would be brought back from exile and into the Promised Land, where they would rebuild the sanctuary and worship Yahweh; bad, because apparently their subsequent unfaithfulness would lead to persecution and the disruption of temple activity (vv. 11–12).

<span id="page-111-6"></span>The little horn would "throw truth to the ground." If this vile figure was going to trample the saints and desecrate the sanctuary, the "truth" he would throw to the ground was probably the Torah, the Law of God specifying how the Israelites should worship him and live as his people.

Although Daniel could not have known the identity of this figure, as history unfolded the terrible ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes conformed closest to this prophesied blasphemer. There is "virtually unanimous agreement that this little horn must be identified as the Seleucid king Antiochus IV, who persecuted the Jews and desecrated God's temple."50 Antiochus ruled from 175 to 164 BC, and *2 Maccabees* reports how he ordered a slaughter of Jews, resulting in approximately forty thousand dying by violence and around the same number being sold into slavery (*2 Macc.* 5:12–14). Antiochus attacked the temple and, in 167 BC, ordered the cessation of regular offerings (*1 Macc.* 1:20–24). On December 6, 167, he set up an idol to Zeus on

<sup>50</sup> Greidanus, *Preaching Christ from Daniel*, 257.

the altar of the temple, thus desecrating the sanctuary (*1 Macc.* 1:54; *2 Macc.* 6:1–2), and on December 16 he defiled the altar by offering pagan sacrifices, including pigs (*1 Macc.* 1:44–47, 59; *2 Macc.* 6:4). He cast down the "truth" by forbidding practices commanded in the Law (keeping Sabbath, circumcision) and forcing Jews to adopt Greek customs and religious practices (*1 Macc.* 1:41–51; *2 Macc.* 6:1–11). Engaging in such atrocities, Antiochus would "act and prosper" (Dan. 8:12).

<span id="page-112-10"></span><span id="page-112-5"></span>8:13 Daniel heard the voice of "a holy one speaking"—an angel.51 A second angel ("another holy one") asked the speaker, "For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?" (Cf. comment on 11:31.) Whenever God's people endure suffering, a frequent question is, "How long?" (Pss. 13:1–2; 79:5; 80:4; Rev. 6:10).

<span id="page-112-2"></span>8:14 The other angel answered, "For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state." Whatever this specific time frame meant, the good news was that at a point subsequent to the desecration caused by the little horn, God's temple would be restored. This promise would provide hope to those living amid the raging of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

<span id="page-112-7"></span><span id="page-112-1"></span><span id="page-112-0"></span>"Evenings and mornings" reminds us of Genesis 1, where "there was evening and there was morning" occurs six times (Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31). The phrase in Daniel 8:14 may mean that a certain number of days were in view, since "evening" and "morning" denote a day in Genesis 1. Moreover, regular temple sacrifices were made every "evening" and "morning," so the language in Daniel 8:14 could be alluding to the sacrificial system.

However, how best to interpret "2,300" is debatable. If literal days are meant, then 2,300 days is approximately six years and three months. This timeline does not appear to be historically significant, however, nor does it account for the use of "evenings" and "mornings" (rather than "days") in this verse. A literal rendering of the angel's words is "evening, morning, two thousand and three hundred."52 The specification of "evening" and "morning" probably suggests a certain number of sacrifices over a certain number of days. Since sacrifices were made "morning" and "evening," 2,300 sacrifices would take place over a span of 1,150 days. The 2,300, therefore, counted the sacrifices, not the days.53

The number 1,150 was historically significant during the terror inflicted by Antiochus: the period from the temple's desecration (December 6, 167 BC; *1 Macc.* 1:54) to its first sacrifice on the newly consecrated altar (December 14, 164; *1 Macc.* 4:52–53) was 1,106 days (164 BC being a Julian leap year). When one angel asked about the time period from desecration to restoration (Dan. 8:13), the other angel

<span id="page-112-9"></span><span id="page-112-8"></span><span id="page-112-4"></span><sup>53</sup> That a number of sacrifices (rather than days) was given is strengthened when we remember that the little horn's activity would disrupt the "regular burnt offering" (Dan. 8:11), which included the usual morning and evening sacrifices. Later, Gabriel called the vision "the vision of the evenings and mornings" (8:26) and appeared to Daniel "at the time of the evening sacrifice" (9:21), confirming that "evening" may specify a time of sacrifice.

answered with a number near 1,150 (v. 14). The use of round or approximate numbers was an acceptable practice and was not considered failed prophecy.54 Understood this way, the angel's answer was proved correct in the unfolding of historical events. Judas Maccabeus recaptured Jerusalem, purified the temple Antiochus had defiled, and erected a new altar to reestablish sacrificial activity for the Jewish people.55 Jews instituted the remembrance of the temple's rededication in a feast known as Hanukkah, which Jesus celebrated (cf. John 10:22–23).

<span id="page-113-15"></span><span id="page-113-10"></span><span id="page-113-9"></span><span id="page-113-6"></span>8:15 After Daniel reported what he saw and heard in the vision (vv. 1–14), he recounted the interpretation that followed (vv. 15–27). His desire was to understand the vision, and he reported that suddenly "there stood before me one having the appearance of a man"; the reader will soon learn that this was an angel.

<span id="page-113-11"></span><span id="page-113-1"></span>8:16 A voice between the banks of the Ulai spoke to the figure who had appeared to Daniel and said, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision." This figure appeared "between the banks of the Ulai," a place where no mere mortal could hover. The voice belonged to God, who commands his angels (cf. Ps. 91:11). In words Daniel could understand, God named the figure ("Gabriel") and commanded that an interpretation be given. This is the first time in Scripture an angel's name is mentioned.

<span id="page-113-12"></span><span id="page-113-4"></span>8:17 Gabriel approached Daniel in obedience to God's voice, but the angel's appearance frightened Daniel, who fell on his face. Ezekiel had a similar reaction upon seeing the living creatures surrounding the throne of God (Ezek. 1:28); like Ezekiel, Daniel was addressed as "son of man" (cf. Ezek. 2:1, 3, 6, etc.).

<span id="page-113-5"></span>Gabriel referenced the timing of the vision's fulfillment: "Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end." The language of "the end" informed Daniel that the future fulfillment of these events would occur beyond his own lifetime; he would not see the rise and atrocities of the little horn. The "end" in view was the completion of the "2,300 evenings and mornings" (Dan. 8:14), so Gabriel may be referring specifically to the "end" of the persecution that occupied almost half of the vision (vv. 9–14).

<span id="page-113-13"></span><span id="page-113-8"></span><span id="page-113-7"></span><span id="page-113-2"></span>8:18 Daniel had already reacted to *seeing* Gabriel (v. 17), and now he reacted to *hearing* him: "I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground." This was reminiscent of Isaiah, who, in the presence of the thrice-holy God and his winged angels, was "lost" (Isa. 6:1–7). Daniel adopted a prostrate position, symbolizing fear and unworthiness. Though Gabriel was not God, he was a messenger of God, and Daniel was consumed with fear.

<span id="page-113-14"></span>Daniel reported that Gabriel "touched me and made me stand up." This event would reoccur in chapter 10 when Daniel again fell into a deep sleep and a hand

<span id="page-113-3"></span><span id="page-113-0"></span><sup>54</sup> The Israelites were in Egypt for 430 years (Ex. 12:40–41) rather than 400 (Gen. 15:13), and Israel's Babylonian captivity was not exactly seventy years (Jer. 25:11–12; 29:10) but roughly sixty-eight years (counting from 605 to 538 BC when the first wave of exiles returned to the Promised Land). 55 Cf. Steinmann, *Daniel*, 406.

<span id="page-114-12"></span><span id="page-114-1"></span><span id="page-114-0"></span>set him upright (10:9–11). In Ezekiel's prophetic call, God's Spirit enabled him to stand and receive the word God had for him (Ezek. 2:1–3), and both Jeremiah (Jer. 1:9) and Isaiah (Isa. 6:7) were touched to enable their prophetic ministry. Daniel, likewise, was strengthened to hear and report God's word.

<span id="page-114-7"></span><span id="page-114-6"></span>8:19 Gabriel explained why he had come: "I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end." The "latter end of the indignation" most likely shares the same referent as "the time of the end" (v. 17) and "the appointed time of the end" (v. 19). These phrases refer to the acts of the little horn, Antiochus IV Epiphanes—particularly his assaults against the Jews in Jerusalem.

<span id="page-114-8"></span><span id="page-114-3"></span>8:20 Though several verses in the vision were devoted to the ram (vv. 3–7), Gabriel merely identified the ram's two horns (vv. 3, 20) before moving on to the goat. The ram's horns represented "the kings of Media and Persia," confirming that the beast itself was the Medo-Persian Empire. The Medo-Persian rule lasted from 539 to 331 BC, spanning the period from its conquest of Babylon to its being conquered by Greece.

<span id="page-114-9"></span>8:21 Gabriel next interpreted the second animal of Daniel's vision: the goat was "the king of Greece." Greece defeated the Medo-Persians in 331 BC, headed by the goat's "great horn between his eyes"—Alexander, "the first king."

<span id="page-114-10"></span>8:22 This "great horn" (v. 21) "was broken," which was fulfilled in 323 BC when Alexander the Great died; in his place "four others arose." These "four others" were his four generals—Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy—who assumed control over different portions of the Greek Empire.

<span id="page-114-2"></span>The final phrase of verse 22 ("but not with his power") *may* imply that God was the power behind these historical events. God broke the horn (Alexander), and by his sovereign control over history four generals took Alexander's place. God brings down and lifts up, and none can stay his hand (cf. 4:34–35). It is also possible the phrase describes the lesser power of the four kingdoms: they would replace Alexander but not be as great as he. The four rulers were depicted with "horns" (8:8), but only Alexander was a "great horn" (v. 21).

<span id="page-114-11"></span><span id="page-114-5"></span><span id="page-114-4"></span>8:23 At "the latter end" of the rule of these generals, "a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise." Because the vision described "a little horn" growing out of the four (vv. 8–9), this "king of bold face" must be that little horn—Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who descended from the Seleucids and came to power in 175 BC. The timing of his arrival would be by divine decree, for God had appointed a "limit" to the deeds of "the transgressors," a pejorative term probably referring to Jews who would transgress the Torah and urge other Jews to do so as well (*1 Macc.* 1:11–15). When the transgressors reached the limit of their sin, Antiochus would arise on the stage of history as the instrument of divine judgment.

The little horn was a "king of bold face" and "one who understands riddles" (Dan. 8:23). The first description denotes his boldness and arrogance in assaulting the Jews and their sanctuary. The second describes his intellectual prowess and cleverness. No doubt Daniel would have considered himself one who understood riddles, so the fact that this "king of bold face" could likewise understand riddles may have been unsettling to Daniel.

<span id="page-115-6"></span><span id="page-115-1"></span>8:24 The little horn "shall be great—but not by his own power," reminding the reader that rulers rule *where* and *when* they do because of God's sovereign will (cf. 2:21; 4:35). With this power the king "shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints." Antiochus's conquests included "the glorious land" (cf. 8:9), where he trampled the saints—depicted in verse 10 as the starry host he threw down to the ground. Thousands of Jews would be killed.

<span id="page-115-7"></span><span id="page-115-4"></span><span id="page-115-3"></span><span id="page-115-0"></span>8:25 The opening phrase—"By his cunning"—echoes verse 23 and the arrogant king's intelligence and cleverness. Like the serpent in Genesis 3:1, Antiochus would be shrewd enough to "make deceit prosper under his hand," and this success would inflate his ego. Antiochus's appended title "Epiphanes" indicated his self-identification as someone in whom God was manifest.

<span id="page-115-5"></span>The ominous prediction "Without warning he shall destroy many" may refer to the brutal invasion of Jerusalem and eventual desecration of its temple. According to *1 Maccabees* 1:29–32, Antiochus pillaged the city, set it ablaze, demolished its homes, and captured women and children. This assault against God's people set him against God himself: "He shall even rise up against the Prince of princes" (cf. "Prince" in Dan. 8:11). Although Antiochus appeared to prosper without repercussion or rival, the Prince of princes would be both superior and triumphant. The little horn "shall be broken—but by no human hand," a confirmation that God's judgment would befall the king of bold face. Accounts of Antiochus's demise differ, yet it was clear that he was not killed in battle or assassinated (cf. *1 Macc.* 6:1–16; *2 Macc.* 9:5–7).

<span id="page-115-8"></span><span id="page-115-2"></span>8:26 Gabriel described the vision as "the vision of the evenings and the mornings," a reference to the regular sacrifices made twice a day that ceased due to the intervention of Antiochus in Jerusalem. Even though the vision of verses 1–14 pertained to more than the persecution inflicted by the little horn, Gabriel's calling it the vision *of the evenings and the mornings* highlighted the key point of what Daniel had seen. Daniel heard that the vision "is true." As terrible as these prophecies must have sounded, Daniel needed to know they would unfold as predicted.

Daniel would not witness the bold king's raging. Gabriel told him to "seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now." The main fulfillment of the vision—the years of the Greeks and the rise of the little horn—was several centuries in the future. Daniel saw the vision in approximately 548 BC, and Antiochus IV Epiphanes did not come to power until 175 BC. By sealing the writing, Daniel would preserve these prophecies for subsequent generations, especially for those who would endure the terrible persecution of the little horn.

<span id="page-116-2"></span><span id="page-116-1"></span><span id="page-116-0"></span>8:27 The interpretation section began and ended with "I, Daniel" (vv. 15, 27). After Gabriel finished speaking, Daniel admitted to being "overcome" and "sick for some days." This was not the first time Daniel experienced alarm at what he had seen in a vision (cf. 4:19; 7:15, 28), but 8:27 is the first report that Daniel was ill for a short period of time. When the sickness passed, Daniel "rose and went about the king's business," business that may have been reduced in scope due to his advancing age (he was probably in his seventies).

Daniel's final words in the chapter were negative: "I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it." The prophesied persecution of the saints was too much for him to take in, and many historical details remained unclear since most of the vision pertained to the distant future.

#### *Response*

Believers get discouraged. Worshipers of the true and living God face moments, even seasons, of confusion. Those who confess Christ alone as Savior walk a road on which we are not promised tomorrow or even the end of this paragraph. The wicked may live long while the righteous suffer. Opponents of the gospel seem to succeed, while those who endure for the sake of the gospel may lose every earthly good and comfort. Were it not for the knowledge that God is sovereign over heaven and earth and all those who dwell therein, that he is propelling the course of events for his glory and the furtherance of his kingdom, that he is committed to the display of his righteousness at the end-time judgment of all people, we might search in vain for a reason to persevere when things seem uncertain, inconceivable, or unconscionable.

Daniel was discouraged. He saw a vision in which the saints would suffer under the hand of a hostile king. What he saw and heard made him physically ill for days, and no matter how much time passed, he did not fully comprehend the vision. He was overcome by the revelation of what lay in store for the saints. Great atrocities would come. A little horn would align against the Prince of God's people, and both the people and their place of worship would be assaulted and defiled.

Sometimes we may think that knowing the future would be better than living every day in ignorance. We might assume a roadmap of coming events would allow us to prepare ourselves and others. Would we not like to know what suffering is in our future, whether we would contract cancer, lose a child to tragedy, fail at a business venture, witness the disappointments of friends or loved ones, or know the date of our death? A part of us might imagine that such knowledge would help us live with greater purpose, focus, and tenacity to make the most of the days allotted for us.

But we are not gods. Such knowledge of the future would not be empowering so much as it would be paralyzing and disheartening. If we knew how things <span id="page-117-0"></span>would turn out for our lives and the lives of others, such information might leave us angry at God, powerless, and without faith. Prophetic visions like Daniel 8 remind us that the future is too great for any one person to bear. God alone can handle the future. Daniel saw only a few aspects of a few hundred years, and that small slice of history brought debilitating discouragement!

<span id="page-117-1"></span>Daniel trusted Yahweh, and continuing to trust was the very thing he had to do after the appalling vision of chapter 8. Daniel saw enough to know that there was hope—hope not only that the Israelites would return to Jerusalem and the temple would be rebuilt (cf. vv. 9–12) but also hope that the mighty Prince would triumph over the malevolent adversary who would come against them with persecuting zeal. None would oppose God forever. Victory was promised (v. 25).

<span id="page-117-2"></span>We do not know what tomorrow will bring. We do not even have assurances of how this day will end. But Daniel 8 keeps before our minds the unchanging truth that God knows the future, and the story he is telling will end in victory and vindication for his kingdom and his people. There may be suffering. There may be persecution. There may be death. But God, who holds all earthly kingdoms and rulers in his hand, is in control and can be trusted. Since he will vanquish his enemies, during this interim period we should repent of sin and confess Jesus as risen Lord and Savior. May God grant us the conviction and courage of Moses, who preferred "to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward" (Heb. 11:25–26).

**<sup>3</sup>**Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. **<sup>4</sup>** I prayed to the Lord my God and made confession, saying, "O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, **5**we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules. **6**We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. **7**To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-119-1"></span><span id="page-119-0"></span>When Daniel reads in Jeremiah of seventy years of captivity, he realizes that the end of that time is imminent and therefore he offers confession and pleas on behalf of exiled Israel (Dan. 9:1–19). He extolls God's steadfast covenant love and acknowledges Israel's wicked deeds and stubborn hearts, which warranted their judgment and exile (vv. 4–15). Then he asks God to turn his wrath away from Jerusalem and make his face shine on the desolate sanctuary (vv. 16–19). God responds to Daniel's prayer by sending Gabriel with a prophecy of "seventy sevens" (cf. vv. 20–27).

<span id="page-120-7"></span>As in some earlier sections of the book, we find Daniel praying, encountering a heavenly figure, and receiving revelation about future events. Yet chapter 9 consists mostly of prayer (vv. 4–19). Gabriel's message (vv. 24–27), which usually receives the most attention because of its fascinating timeline, is only a few verses long. The importance of the chapter is evident in its placement between the visions of chapters 8 and 10–12, forming an A-B-A' pattern. The chiasm is evident as the visions in Daniel 8 and 10–12 both address the Medo-Persian and Greek kingdoms.56 In the Hebrew vision-chapters, Daniel 9 is featured in the center.

- <span id="page-120-4"></span><span id="page-120-2"></span>A. Daniel 8
	- B. Daniel 9
- <span id="page-120-8"></span>A'. Daniel 10–12

The prophecy of chapter 9 warrants central placement in Daniel's literary design, for it foretells the famous "seventy sevens" (cf. vv. 24–27) that reached fulfillment in the redemptive work of the Messiah and the judgment on the Jerusalem temple. The vision of chapter 9, therefore, covers the period from 539 BC (a year before the Jews returned to Jerusalem) to AD 70 (the destruction of the temple during the Roman Empire).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-120-5"></span><span id="page-120-1"></span>9:1–2 The events of chapter 9 took place in "the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans." This king conquered the Babylonians (cf. 5:31) and was the same person as Cyrus the Persian. He "was made king" by God, who raises up and brings down rulers according to his will (cf. 2:21). The Medo-Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC, the same year as Gabriel's message to Daniel in this chapter.

<span id="page-120-0"></span>During the first year of Darius's reign (539 BC), Daniel "perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years." The "books" Daniel was reading must have included books of the OT, for he mentioned one in particular: Jeremiah. Daniel believed God had spoken to Jeremiah and that what Jeremiah recorded was accurate and authoritative revelation. Daniel called Jeremiah a "prophet," thus recognizing his status as God's mouthpiece.

<span id="page-120-6"></span>The exile is described here as "the desolations of Jerusalem" (Dan. 9:2), and Daniel learned of the amount of time that had to pass before the exile would

<span id="page-120-3"></span><sup>56</sup> To cite Goldingay again, "It is with chapter 8 that chapters 10–12 have most detailed points of contact. Reminiscences of almost every verse of chapter 8 reappear here" (*Daniel*, 283).

end and the desolations would be over. Jeremiah had said, "This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the Lord, making the land an everlasting waste" (Jer. 25:11–12).

<span id="page-121-6"></span><span id="page-121-3"></span><span id="page-121-2"></span>Daniel 1:1–7 reported the arrival of King Nebuchadnezzar in Jerusalem and his deportation of Daniel to Babylon, in 605 BC. Using the time frame of the opening verse of chapter 9, Daniel had now been in exile approximately sixty-six years (605–539). He was confident, therefore, that the exile would soon end. This truth stirred Daniel to prayer.

<span id="page-121-5"></span><span id="page-121-4"></span>9:3 We have already seen Daniel as a man of prayer (2:17–23; 6:10–11), but only once previously was one of his prayers recorded (2:20–23, a prayer of praise and thanksgiving). Now the reader encounters a second recorded prayer, the longest prayer of the book, covering most of the chapter (9:3–19).

<span id="page-121-8"></span><span id="page-121-0"></span>Daniel prayed with his "face to the Lord," which means he prayed toward Jerusalem—demonstrating, no doubt, his longing for return from exile. At the dedication of the temple, Solomon had prayed for God to hear from heaven if his captive people repented from the heart and prayed toward the Promised Land (1 Kings 8:46–50). Because Daniel believed what he read in Scripture, he prayed toward Jerusalem. His heart longed for restoration and was grieved over the sin of Israel. His "pleas for mercy" (Dan. 9:3) would be made explicit in verses 4–19. To represent the contrition of the Jews in exile, Daniel fasted and put on "sackcloth and ashes," outward signs of repentance (cf. 2 Kings 19:2; Isa. 37:1; Lam. 2:10; Jonah 3:5–7).

<span id="page-121-13"></span><span id="page-121-12"></span><span id="page-121-10"></span><span id="page-121-7"></span><span id="page-121-1"></span>9:4–19 Most of Daniel's prayer was confession. He asserted that God's people had sinned, done wrong, acted wickedly, rebelled, ignored the prophets, committed treachery, disobeyed God's voice, and transgressed the law (vv. 5–7, 10–11) and thus deserved open shame and the law's curse (vv. 7–8, 11–14). On the other hand, God had demonstrated steadfast love, had sent ample warnings through faithful prophets, could dispense mercy and forgiveness, had kept his promise of judgment, was righteous in all his works, was remembered for his mighty power in delivering Israel from Egypt, and alone could hear the pleas of his penitent people (vv. 4, 6, 9, 12, 14–15, 19).

<span id="page-121-11"></span><span id="page-121-9"></span>9:4 Daniel confessed the sin of his people. He began his prayer by describing the Lord as "the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments." God not only does great things; he himself is great and worthy of worship and awe. God's character displays a covenant-keeping zeal, and keeping covenant is synonymous with showing steadfast love to his people. This verse also refers to "those who love him and keep his commandments," and the idea of keeping (or failing to keep) what God has commanded will resurface throughout the chapter.

<span id="page-122-3"></span>9:5–6 Daniel's opening admissions intentionally overlap: "We have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled." This rebellion was manifested by their "turning aside from your commandments and rules." Of all nations in the world, God had chosen Israel to be his people and to receive his law. He loved them and entered into covenant with them, yet they disobeyed his commands. This rebellion of privileged and chosen Israel against God was devastating and unconscionable.

<span id="page-122-4"></span>God had sent mouthpieces to exhort his people and warn them of coming judgment, but his people had not "listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land" (v. 6). The ministry of the prophets was sufficient testimony that God was not silent while the people strayed. The voices of Isaiah, Hosea, Jeremiah, Ezekiel—and many others!—declared to the people, "Thus says the Lord!" God's oracles were given even to kings, showing the comprehensiveness of his warnings and commands. The eventual exile showed that he held his people accountable to the oracles they had not heeded.

<span id="page-122-9"></span><span id="page-122-5"></span>9:7–8 There was a gulf between the holy God and his sinful people: "To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day." God did and does what is right, but the Judeans did what was wrong, and thus the open shame they received was warranted. They had become a byword among the nations (v. 16), for God had given them into the hands of their enemies. Shame was shared by *everyone* ("to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel") *everywhere* ("those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them"). The shame they bore was "because of the treachery that they have committed against you," treachery Daniel had outlined in verses 5–6.

<span id="page-122-6"></span>9:9–10 The imminent end of exile confirmed God's undeserved mercy to the Jews. To God belonged "mercy and forgiveness," while Israel's unworthiness of these gifts was clear in that "we have rebelled against him and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets." Daniel's logic was flawless: God spoke through the prophets, so when the people rejected the message of the prophets, they rejected God. By disobeying the prophets, God's people did not walk "in his laws" but instead walked contrary to them. The people of Israel had not deserved such a merciful season of warnings, but God had been longsuffering and gracious. When the Persians conquered the Babylonians and permitted a return to the Promised Land, the people would again see that God's mercy far exceeded their sin and guilt.

<span id="page-122-8"></span><span id="page-122-7"></span><span id="page-122-2"></span><span id="page-122-1"></span><span id="page-122-0"></span>9:11 Daniel asserted that all Israel had transgressed God's law, and thus "the curse and oath that are written in the Law . . . have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him." Since God's "prophets" were called "servants" in verse 10, calling Moses God's "servant" implied his prophetic status as well (cf. Deut. 18:18). The "curse" and "oath" of the Law refers to such passages as Leviticus 26:14–45 and Deuteronomy 28:15–68 that outline the judgments for disobedience—including <span id="page-123-3"></span>judgment by exile (cf. Lev. 26:33–39; Deut. 28:36–41, 49–52). The people of Israel did not keep the commands of the covenant, so God did what he had promised: he applied the curses of the covenant.

<span id="page-123-4"></span>9:12 The calamity of the exile was "great" because, "under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem." Certainly calamitous events had befallen other nations as well, but what happened against Israel was the result of covenant violations against the God who had shown steadfast love and had been remarkably longsuffering, but who now may seem to have forsaken his people.

<span id="page-123-5"></span><span id="page-123-2"></span>9:13 Daniel again appealed to the "Law of Moses" as the basis according to which "all this calamity has come upon us" (cf. Lev. 26:14–45; Deut. 28:15–68). In their state of exile, the people needed divine favor, and since only Yahweh could grant such grace, they should implore him for it. The result of "gaining insight by your truth" would be the ability to walk in wisdom; the time immediately preceding the exile had been characterized by much foolishness.

<span id="page-123-6"></span>9:14 Yahweh had stored up the curse of the covenant, ready at the appointed time to be poured out on his disobedient people. He finally brought it upon Israel due to the fact that he "is righteous in all the works that he has done, and [Israel had] not obeyed his voice." God was righteous; the people were unrighteous. Part of God's expressing his righteousness was his covenant-keeping, curse-outpouring act of expelling his people from the Promised Land.

9:15 Israel did not defy just anyone; they defied the very God who had redeemed them from Egyptian captivity. The exodus loomed large in the history of Israel as a pivotal event, one to which later writers looked back for hope, reassurance, and empowerment. They needed to remember. At the same time, this reminder placed Israel's rebellion in an awful light, for they should have responded to God's redemptive act with single-minded devotion and a zealous covenantal love that did not fizzle out at the first experience of weariness or impatience (Ex. 32:1–6).

<span id="page-123-10"></span><span id="page-123-7"></span><span id="page-123-1"></span><span id="page-123-0"></span>God had "made a name" for himself (Dan. 9:15) when he delivered Israel from Egypt (cf. Josh. 2:10–11) with his "mighty hand" (cf. Ex. 15:6, 12, 16; 32:11). Since God associated his name with Israel, however, their rebellion had now dishonored his name. Later in the prayer, however (Dan. 9:18–19), Daniel will appeal to God's associating his name with Israel as the reason why he should now show mercy: if God's name was dishonored by Israel's rebellion, what might it mean for his name if they were to be restored and revived!

<span id="page-123-9"></span><span id="page-123-8"></span>9:16 Verse 15 was a transition from confession to petition, and verses 16–19 are all petition. Affirming God's righteousness, Daniel asked him to turn away his anger from Jerusalem, "your holy hill." God's people were experiencing shame and condescension from pagan nations. Now that Medo-Persia was in power, Daniel pleaded for God to change things so that Israel might no longer be a "byword."

<span id="page-124-2"></span>9:17 Daniel called upon Yahweh to "listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy." Despite living in a foreign land, Daniel had not served other gods. He had remained Yahweh's faithful "servant." Daniel had served in the royal court, but he had not allowed that service to compromise his devotion to God. Daniel described the action he hoped God would take: "make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate." The notion of God's shining face recalls Numbers 6:24–26, the blessing of Aaron to the people of Israel: "The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace." The high priest had important roles in God's temple ("your sanctuary"; Dan. 9:17). The Lord would be acting for his own sake because, according to Numbers 6:27, his name was on the people of Israel. A restored nation and temple would certainly be for the people's sake too, although in a lesser sense, because ultimately what mattered most was the glory of God among the nations.

<span id="page-124-7"></span><span id="page-124-4"></span><span id="page-124-3"></span>9:18 Again Daniel prayed for Yahweh to "incline your ear and hear," and to "Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name." Daniel's plea for God to hear and see echoes Hezekiah's prayer in 2 Kings 19:16: "Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God." The greater context of Hezekiah's prayer illumines the reason for his request: "The kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Lord our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Lord, are God alone" (2 Kings 19:17–19). Just as the Assyrians had brought devastation in Hezekiah's day, so the Babylonians had brought devastation in Daniel's day. Hezekiah pleaded for Yahweh to act so that the kingdoms of the world would know who the true God was, and Daniel believed the same would be true if Yahweh now restored his people from a foreign land.

<span id="page-124-8"></span><span id="page-124-6"></span><span id="page-124-5"></span>Daniel did not call upon God to see and hear "because of our righteousness" (Dan. 9:18). Already in the prayer Daniel had boldly confessed that Israel had rebelled, had committed wickedness, and was worthy only of open shame for its treachery (vv. 4–8). Daniel knew God was merciful, however. And on that basis he made his request. Wrath removed would be mercy. A land once again filled with worshipers would be mercy. City walls erected would be mercy. The temple brimming with God-honoring sacrifices would be mercy. Daniel prayed for mercy because he believed what Scripture taught about God (cf. Ex. 34:6–7). God could show mercy whenever he willed to do so (Ex. 33:19).

<span id="page-124-9"></span><span id="page-124-1"></span><span id="page-124-0"></span>9:19 The end of Daniel's prayer was also its climax. Several repetitions should be noted: the call for God to hear and pay attention, the call for God to act for his own sake, and the language of the city and people being called by his name. Daniel prayed specifically for forgiveness, which would lead to the shining of God's face and the removal of wrath. God had appointed a temporary period of captivity, and Daniel pleaded that there be no delay in ending it!

<span id="page-125-3"></span><span id="page-125-2"></span><span id="page-125-0"></span>9:20–21 Something happened during Daniel's prayer. He had been praying a confession and plea on behalf of Israel, asking God to show mercy to Jerusalem, "the holy hill of my God," and while he was speaking the angel Gabriel appeared "in swift flight." Gabriel is called "the man" because he appeared in that form. Daniel had seen Gabriel earlier, "in the vision at the first," which may refer to 8:16–17 or possibly 7:16. Gabriel arrived "at the time of the evening sacrifice," which does not imply that Jewish sacrifices were being offered in Babylon but merely indicates an evening encounter. The notion of "evening sacrifice" also recalls the vision of chapter 8, where in verse 14 the evening and morning sacrifices were in view. Sacrifice will also play a role in the revelation Gabriel will give in 9:27.

<span id="page-125-9"></span><span id="page-125-4"></span><span id="page-125-1"></span>9:22–23 Gabriel made clear why he had come: "I have now come out to give you insight and understanding." This understanding was what Daniel had been seeking by reading Jeremiah and by praying for mercy. As Daniel had begun to pray, "a word went out" from God, and Gabriel now came bearing that word. This word will be explained in the "vision" of verses 24–27.57

9:24–27 For many readers, 9:24–27 is the most challenging section of the book and one of the most difficult in the Bible. According to Greidanus, "Reading commentaries on the last four verses of Daniel 9 is akin to entering a bewildering maze: so many choices of ways to take, so many blind alleys and dead ends."58 We will seek to carve as straight a path as possible through the maze.

<span id="page-125-8"></span><span id="page-125-7"></span>In verse 24 Gabriel listed six purposes of a prophesied "seventy sevens" (cf. ESV mg.), and in verses 25–27 he addressed this time period, in three parts: seven sevens (v. 25a), then sixty-two sevens (v. 25b), and finally a seventieth seven (vv. 26–27). The seventieth seven received the most elaboration of any of the sevens. Table 1.13 summarizes the breakdown of the sevens and the corresponding interpretation that will be suggested in the subsequent comments:

|                       | The First Seven                                                                                                        | The Next Sixty-Two                                                                                                      | The Seventieth                                                                                                             |

<span id="page-125-6"></span>TABLE 1.13: The "Sevens" of Daniel 9:24–27

<span id="page-125-5"></span>9:24 Gabriel announced, "Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city." The objects of God's decree are the Jews and Jerusalem. The number

<sup>57</sup> Cf. Greidanus, *Preaching Christ from Daniel*, 330.

<sup>58</sup> Ibid., 285.

"seventy" is essential for the remaining verses, which divide it threefold, so understanding the source of this number is vital to a proper interpretation.

The number "seventy" appeared earlier in chapter 9 when the prophet was reading in the book of Jeremiah about the desolations of Jerusalem ending after "seventy years" of captivity (v. 2). Gabriel's message played upon the "seventy" and promised "seventy sevens" or "seventy weeks." And if the "seventy" in Gabriel's message played on the "seventy" from Jeremiah 25:11–12 (cf. Dan. 9:2), it is reasonable to assume the "sevens/weeks" played on the years of Daniel 9:2 as well. A decree of "seventy sevens/weeks" probably meant 490 years (70 × 7).

<span id="page-126-3"></span>Another issue is whether we should take the 490 years literally or symbolically. Observe first that even though Jeremiah wrote about seventy years of captivity, the Jews were actually in exile less than seventy years. If Gabriel's message then used that number, perhaps we should expect a figurative or symbolic meaning rather than applying 490 with strict literalism, for not even the number seventy was applied with the sort of precision often expected today. Further pointing us in the direction of nonliteral interpretation of the "seventy sevens" is the probable source of the "sevens." Seven is a number of completion and perfection, and Leviticus 25:8–12 most likely informed Daniel's understanding of Gabriel's message:

<span id="page-126-2"></span>You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years. Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan. That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines. For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. You may eat the produce of the field.

<span id="page-126-6"></span><span id="page-126-5"></span><span id="page-126-0"></span>In Leviticus 25 a multiplication of "seven weeks of years" (v. 8) resulted in fortynine years. The fiftieth year was jubilee, a time of freedom and climactic observance. That Gabriel's message should be understood in light of the jubilee passage in Leviticus 25 is evident by the first division he gives to Daniel in Daniel 9:25: seven sevens/weeks. Next, sixty-two more sevens are given (v. 25b), and then the climactic seven/week receives the most attention (vv. 26–27). The seventy sevens in verse 24 denote jubilee; if seven sevens in Leviticus 25:8 led to jubilee, then seventy sevens in Daniel 9:24 is a tenfold and ultimate jubilee!

<span id="page-126-7"></span><span id="page-126-4"></span><span id="page-126-1"></span>The reason for a tenfold jubilee is evident in the six results Gabriel listed: God decreed the seventy sevens "to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place" (v. 24). The mention of transgression, sin, and iniquity is significant in light of Daniel's prayer, which confessed Israel's sin (vv. 4–15) and pleaded for mercy and forgiveness (vv. 16–19). God was saying to Daniel, "I will take care of the sin. Atonement will be accomplished." This future work would bring in everlasting righteousness, a permanence that worshipers of Yahweh longed for. "Vision and prophet" probably refers to God's revelation until this atonement was accomplished. Once sin had been dealt with in this future redemptive work, prior revelation would be fulfilled, and eclipsed, by the jubilee event God would accomplish. If understood as a hendiadys (two words conveying a single concept), "vision and prophet" may be understood as a "prophetic vision" and may have Jeremiah's prophecy of return from exile in view. Gabriel was giving Daniel insight into how Jeremiah's words would ultimately be "sealed" or "confirmed." Part of God's atoning plan included anointing a "most holy place" or, probably more accurately, "most holy *one*." No anointing was ever reported for Solomon's temple or the rebuilt temple under Ezra. An individual, not a structure, is meant. The work of this anointed individual would appear shortly in the breakdown of the seventy sevens (vv. 25–27).

<span id="page-127-8"></span><span id="page-127-7"></span><span id="page-127-6"></span><span id="page-127-3"></span>Given the stupendous effects of the seventy sevens, it is worth noting that the first sixty-nine sevens do not mention the kind of effects listed in verse 24. The seventieth seven, though, includes an anointed one being cut off, destruction of city and sanctuary, and desolations that have been decreed (v. 26). Furthermore, a covenant will be made and sacrifices will end (v. 27). The six remarkable outcomes in verse 24, therefore, would not be accomplished gradually throughout the first sixty-nine weeks. They would come to pass because of what takes place in the seventieth seven.

<span id="page-127-5"></span>9:25a Gabriel began telling Daniel what he should understand: "From the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks." The next "sixty-two weeks" (which will be dealt with in the following subsection) specify that Jerusalem "shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time." The first "seven" and next "sixty-two" weeks seem to deal with the whole span of time envisioned in verse 25, which encompasses the "going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince."

<span id="page-127-4"></span><span id="page-127-2"></span><span id="page-127-1"></span><span id="page-127-0"></span>As history unfolded, "the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem" turned out to be the decree of Cyrus permitting the return of the Jews in 538 BC. Having conquered Babylon in 539, Cyrus released the Jewish exiles the following year. Isaiah reported the Lord's plan to use Cyrus in this manner: "I am the Lord, . . . who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose'; saying of Jerusalem, 'She shall be built,' and of the temple, 'Your foundation shall be laid'" (Isa. 44:24, 28). Later, Ezra recorded, "In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing" (Ezra 1:1), and the proclamation specified a return to Jerusalem to "rebuild the house of the Lord, the God of Israel—he is the God who is in Jerusalem" (v. 3).

<span id="page-128-3"></span><span id="page-128-1"></span>Arguments for dates earlier or later than 538 BC fail to account for the specific texts in Isaiah and Ezra linking the fulfillment of Jeremiah's words to Cyrus's decree for a return from exile. When Daniel received this message from Gabriel, Daniel was in "the first year of Darius" (Dan. 9:1), whom we have equated with Cyrus the Persian (cf. comment on 5:31), and thus Daniel received the revelation from Gabriel shortly before the royal decree was given. Daniel would not only see the Babylonian captivity come to an end; he would also live through the inauguration of the "seventy sevens" that led ultimately to a tenfold jubilee when the anointed one would come and put an end to sin. The anointed one is mentioned before the "seven weeks" (v. 25a) and again after the "sixty-two weeks" (v. 26). This suggests that the arrival, and atoning work, of the anointed one was the grand goal of the "seventy sevens," but he would not come until the sixty-two weeks were complete (cf. v. 26).

<span id="page-128-6"></span><span id="page-128-0"></span>If the "seven weeks" (v. 25a) began at the decree of Cyrus in 538 BC, a literal calculation would put their completion around 489. Because no significant biblical or prophetic event occurred in that year, the "seven weeks" were probably not meant as a literal forty-nine years. Rather, we should see the "seven weeks" (or "seven sevens") as alluding to Leviticus 25:8, where Yahweh told Moses, "You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years." The first "seven weeks" in Daniel 9:25a, therefore, prepared Daniel and the reader for an expectation of jubilee. The "seven sevens," begun in 538 BC, probably extended through the rebuilding of the temple and the city walls during the ministries of Ezra and Nehemiah. The temple was completed and rededicated in 515, while the city wall was finished in 444.

9:25b Referring to Jerusalem, Gabriel told Daniel that "for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time." There is no indication that a gap of time should be inserted between the first seven sevens and the next sixty-two. Since verse 26a says the "anointed one" would come after the sixtytwo sevens, clearly the first seven did not culminate with the anointed one's work.

<span id="page-128-7"></span>Relating the sixty-two sevens (v. 25b) to the seven (v. 25a) is not as difficult as may be initially thought. The sevens are consecutive and uninterrupted. The period of sixty-two sevens probably extended from the time of Nehemiah to the time of Jesus (the anointed one). As with the first seven sevens, we should not press the sixty-two sevens with strict literalism with the intent to specify exactly 434 years. It is a round number, symbolic of the time period from Nehemiah to Jesus.

<span id="page-128-5"></span><span id="page-128-4"></span><span id="page-128-2"></span>There may be further significance to the "sixty-two sevens" of verse 25b. The only other time the number "sixty-two" appeared in the book of Daniel was in 5:31, where it says Darius conquered Babylon, "being about sixty-two years old." Strengthening the connection between 9:25b and 5:31 is the fact that the episode of chapter 9 occurred during "the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede" (9:1a), and the only prior occurrence of "Darius the Mede" was in 5:31.

<span id="page-129-2"></span><span id="page-129-1"></span><span id="page-129-0"></span>Darius/Cyrus would decree freedom for the captives in Babylon. Cyrus was a type of the Messiah, for the latter would also give freedom to captives—to captives of sin and death, out of the deepest exile by way of a new and greater exodus. The book of Isaiah gave prior biblical precedent for viewing Cyrus typologically: he is God's anointed shepherd in Isaiah 44:28–45:1. Cyrus would deliver the captive Israelites as their political savior. In the same section of Isaiah foretelling the work of Cyrus (Isaiah 40–55), God promised a spiritual savior, a suffering servant who would take Israel's iniquities and bear their punishment (Isa. 42:1–9; 49:1–7; 52:13–53:12). The liberation through Cyrus would one day be surpassed by a far greater liberation through the suffering servant, Jesus Christ, whose work of atonement would be an ultimate jubilee. Perhaps, then, the age of Cyrus when he conquered Babylon ("sixty-two"; cf. Dan. 5:31) served as the basis for the symbolic period leading to the antitype of Cyrus, the anointed one who would suffer in the place of sinners and, in doing so, would conquer sin and death through his resurrection.

<span id="page-129-3"></span>For "sixty-two weeks" the city of Jerusalem (including its temple) would remain rebuilt "with squares and moat, but in a troubled time" (9:25b). Gabriel's words probably denote that from Nehemiah to the Messiah, the city would remain standing. The "squares and moat" were mentioned probably to indicate complete restoration. Gabriel did not elaborate on the "troubled time," but it may refer to the atrocities committed by the Greek Empire under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (cf. ch. 8).

<span id="page-129-9"></span><span id="page-129-4"></span>9:26–27 These verses are best understood in an A-B-A'-B' pattern. They tell about the seventieth week, which received the most attention in Gabriel's message to Daniel:

- <span id="page-129-7"></span>A. "And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing." (v. 26a)
	- B. "And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed." (v. 26b)
- <span id="page-129-10"></span><span id="page-129-8"></span>A'. "And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering." (v. 27a)
	- B'. "And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator." (v. 27b)

<span id="page-129-11"></span>In this structure, A and A' refer to the same event: the sacrificial work of the anointed one. Sections B and B' each have a single event in mind as well: the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. Below we will contend that the seventy sevens of chapter 9 reach fulfillment in the vicarious death of Jesus Christ and in the destruction of the Jerusalem temple.

<span id="page-129-6"></span><span id="page-129-5"></span>9:26 Gabriel's next words, "after the sixty-two weeks," indicate the seventieth week is now in view. He declared that "an anointed one shall be cut off and shall <span id="page-130-8"></span><span id="page-130-3"></span><span id="page-130-2"></span>have nothing." This "anointed one" is the prophesied Messiah, a figure fulfilled by Jesus, the "Christ" (i.e., the anointed one; cf. Luke 2:11). Some interpreters have suggested that the "prince who is to come" (Dan. 9:26b) is the future Antichrist.59 There could be no greater contrast between potential referents! We should opt for understanding both figures as "Christ," however, making the "anointed one" and "prince" identical. First, when Gabriel mentioned "anointing" two verses earlier, it was in relation to a most holy person who would end sin and make atonement (v. 24), and the apposition "a prince" after "an anointed one" in verse 25 suggests we should equate the titles. Second, it is unlikely that the "prince" of verse 25 and the "prince" of verse 26 refer to different people. More naturally, the reader should understand "prince" to have the same referent in verses 25 and 26: he is the Messiah, not the Antichrist. Third, no time gap is specified before the seventieth week, yet many Antichrist views require a gap of thousands of years. Such a passing of time has no textual warrant in Daniel 9. Just as we should not project a time gap between the seven sevens and the sixty-nine sevens, so we should not project a gap between the sixty-ninth and seventieth sevens.

<span id="page-130-7"></span><span id="page-130-6"></span><span id="page-130-1"></span><span id="page-130-0"></span>The prediction that this anointed one would be "cut off and shall have nothing" was fulfilled when Jesus died on the cross. He was taken outside the city gate and crucified, abandoned by his disciples and forsaken by the Father (Matt. 26:31; 27:60; Heb. 13:12–13). The seventieth week of Daniel, then, included the redemptive work of Jesus. Given the six remarkable goals of Daniel 9:24, this "cutting off" of the anointed one would be the means of finishing transgression, ending sin, atoning for iniquity, ushering in everlasting righteousness, confirming the prophetic vision, and anointing a most holy person.

A prophecy concerning Jerusalem's city and temple came next: "The people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed." As we have seen, the "prince who is to come" is the same "prince" (or "anointed one") as in verse 25: the Messiah, Jesus. This means "the people of the prince" were the Jews. The prophecy may seem outrageous, then, when it says the Jews will destroy Jerusalem and the temple! After the redemptive work of Jesus, the temple was destroyed in AD 70, and the Jews had a role in it. The Romans, led by Titus, were involved in the destruction, but the transgression of the Jews—particularly their rejection of the Messiah—led to the Messiah's judgment on their temple and city, just as they were complicit when the first temple was destroyed in Daniel's own day. The account of this event given by Josephus, in *The Wars of the Jews*, "is adequate historical proof that the destruction of Jerusalem was entirely the fault of the Jewish people, just as Dan 9:26b predicts."60

<span id="page-130-5"></span><span id="page-130-4"></span>Jesus prophesied the temple's destruction (Matt. 24:1–2), and said that his contemporary generation would not pass away before it happened (v. 34). Jerusalem would be surrounded by armies, which meant "its desolation has come near"

<sup>59</sup> Cf. Miller, *Daniel*, 268.

<span id="page-131-10"></span>(Luke 21:20). Gabriel's words were fulfilled in AD 70: the sanctuary's end came like a flood, with war to the end, for God had decreed its desolation. The imagery "with a flood" pictures the total destruction of the Romans' victory over Jerusalem.

<span id="page-131-3"></span>9:27 Having looked at the A and B sections of Daniel 9:26, we will now see how Gabriel's words take us through the same events again, first the redemptive work of the Messiah and then the judgment on Jerusalem and the temple (A' and B', respectively).61

Speaking of the anointed one, the prince who would come, Gabriel declared, "He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering." The "one week" in view is the seventieth seven. Gabriel was referring to the Messiah's redemptive work as taking place in the climactic period of the "seventy sevens." Gabriel's words did not predict a temporary covenant. In conjunction with prophecies in Isaiah and Jeremiah, this "strong covenant" was probably the new covenant (cf. Isa. 53:10–12; Jer. 31:31–34). The book of Hebrews explains that the anointed one's vicarious offering has put an end to the sacrificial system (Heb. 9:11–10:25).

<span id="page-131-11"></span><span id="page-131-2"></span><span id="page-131-0"></span>The Messiah would make this covenant with "many" (Dan. 9:27; cf. Isa. 53:11– 12), which seems to denote not universality but diversity:62 the new covenant would include Jewish and Gentile believers. Jesus alluded to Daniel 9:27 and Isaiah 53 when he said of the cup at the last supper, "Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:27–28). The Son of Man "came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Matt. 20:28).

<span id="page-131-9"></span><span id="page-131-8"></span><span id="page-131-7"></span>Gabriel prophesied that "for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering." This specification meant the seventieth week would involve more than just the Messiah's work of redemption. As Daniel 9:27b prophesies, the seventieth week would also involve the Messiah's work of judgment on Jerusalem. The seventieth seven, then, is divided in half, with the first three and a half years referring to the work of redemption. Just as the seventieth week in verse 26 consisted of the anointed one being cut off (v. 26a) and the city and sanctuary being destroyed (v. 26b), so verse 27 recapitulates these two ideas and divides the seventieth week in half.

<span id="page-131-5"></span><span id="page-131-4"></span>Likely the second three and a half years is reflected implicitly in the language of verse 27b: "On the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator."63 In keeping with the A-B-A'-B' structure of verses 26–27, this prophecy would be fulfilled in the destruction of the

<span id="page-131-6"></span><sup>61</sup> Quoting Gentry, again: "This approach is kaleidoscopic and recursive. It is like hearing music from stereo system speakers sequentially instead of simultaneously. First comes the music of the right speaker; then comes the music of the left speaker. Then the person hearing (i.e., reading) puts the two together into a three-dimensional stereo whole" (ibid., 36).

<span id="page-131-1"></span><sup>62</sup> According to Gentry, this is "almost certainly 'the many' referred to in Isa 53:10–12. Without doubt, Isaiah 53, describing a future Davidic Servant of the Lord, who is also both priest and sacrifice, laying down his life for the many, is the background to the brief comment in Daniel's vision" (ibid., 37).

Jerusalem temple in AD 70. A desolator would cause abominations until his own destruction occurred. "Wing" may mean "extremity," and thus extreme abominations would be in view (cf. 11:31; 12:11), brought about by a swiftly attacking army.

<span id="page-132-2"></span><span id="page-132-1"></span><span id="page-132-0"></span>Jesus referred to "the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel" (Matt. 24:15), and surely Jesus had in mind Daniel 9:26–27. Significant for interpreting 9:26–27 is Matthew's observation that Jesus was addressing the coming destruction of Jerusalem and the temple (Matt. 24:15). In Luke 21:20 Jesus referred to Jerusalem's approaching "desolation" by the (Roman) armies. The "desolator" was probably a corporate way of depicting the Roman legions, or perhaps Titus (the Roman general) himself fulfilled this role. Jesus prophesied that such days would be "days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. . . . For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled" (Luke 21:22–24). Jesus also specified the time frame: "Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place" (Luke 21:32). In AD 70 the temple was destroyed. The seventieth seven—a period encompassing the work of redemption for the many, as well as the work of judgment against Jerusalem and the temple—had reached completion.

<span id="page-132-4"></span><span id="page-132-3"></span>Peter Gentry provides a perfect summary:

The vision of Daniel's Seventy Weeks, then, can be explained simply. It refers to a period of seventy sabbaticals or periods of seven years required to bring in the ultimate jubilee: release from sin, the establishment of everlasting righteousness and consecration of the temple. During the first seven sabbaticals the city of Jerusalem is restored. Then for sixty-two sabbaticals there is nothing to report. In the climactic seventieth week, Israel's King arrives and dies vicariously for his people. Strangely, desecration of the temple similar to that by Antiochus Epiphanes in the Greek Empire is perpetrated by the Jewish people themselves, resulting in the destruction of Jerusalem. These events are fulfilled in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. He is the coming king. His crucifixion is the sacrifice to end all sacrifices and the basis of the New Covenant with the many.64

## *Response*

Daniel prayed to a sovereign God, and so do we. Daniel's theology viewed God as ruler of all things, superintendent of kingdoms and their rulers, and propeller of history toward appointed goals. But for Daniel the all-encompassing sovereignty of God did not negate the role of prayer. If anything, the sovereignty of God confirmed Daniel's confidence in praying! Also motivating Daniel's prayer was his knowledge of God's mercy and forgiveness. God reconciles sinners to himself, and such a gracious God is worthy of our trust and appeal.

<sup>64</sup> Gentry, "Daniel's 70 Weeks and the New Exodus," 41.

Although Daniel and his friends were exiled in Babylon, he did not interpret his circumstances as meaning that God was not in control or good or worthy of trust. Daniel's God-centered and Bible-saturated theology prepared him for these decades of exile, and he believed God's promise-keeping pattern would not fail. Believers should prepare for suffering and trial and hardship by learning and believing the truths about God from his Word, as its theology shapes how we view our circumstances instead of our circumstances shaping the convictions we hold.

If God is sovereign, we should pray. If God sovereignly grants mercy and forgiveness, we should pray. If God keeps his promises both to save and to judge, we should pray. He is worthy of our allegiance. His Word is worthy of our meditation and reflection. Daniel's reading of Jeremiah helped prompt certain things he prayed, and the content and aim of his prayer were shaped by God's Word. We should devote ourselves to the Bible with the hope that it transforms how we think and pray about God, our lives, and the world around us. Even in Babylon, Daniel operated from a biblical worldview.

<span id="page-133-1"></span>We have an even greater reason than Daniel did to hope in God and be faithful to him: the prophecy of seventy sevens, which lay in his future, was fulfilled in our past through the sin-atoning and sacrifice-ending work of Jesus, the anointed one. God made promises, and those promises came to pass. As Paul put it, all God's promises are "Yes" in Jesus (2 Cor. 1:20). Jesus not only accomplished redemption on the cross for unworthy sinners; he also judged the temple of Jerusalem in AD 70. Desolations were poured out, and the prophecy of the seventy sevens reached complete fulfillment.

The gospel message of Jesus' person and work is a word of jubilee, of liberation from the power of sin and its wages. Through a new and greater exodus, Jesus led his people from the greatest captor and deepest exile. Because he conquered, we conquer. His victory and vindication become ours by grace through faith. If God has lavished such grace and drenched sinners with such mercy, we should trust him with our uncertainties, our anxieties, our fears, our weaknesses, our present, and our future. If this sovereign God, who holds the whole world in his hands, is both perfectly good and incomparably wise, then the suffering and exilic status of the saints is not because of his carelessness, ignorance, cruelty, or confusion. God is on his throne and does all things well.

<span id="page-133-0"></span>When we feel the urge to worry, we should pray instead. When we feel complaint rising within and about to pour forth, we should pray. Jesus prayed, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matt. 27:46), but no suffering saint will ever be in such a situation. We are forgiven because he was forsaken in our place. When the night seems at its darkest hour, God is still our light. His wrath no longer burns against us, and his grace in us works in such a way that trials test and refine our faith. The cross is the place where our sin was finished, our iniquity drowned in atoning blood. As pilgrims bound for the Promised Land of the new heavens and new earth, we can even now say, "It is well with my soul."

10In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict.*<sup>1</sup>* And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.

**<sup>2</sup>** In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. **<sup>3</sup>** I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. **4**On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris) **<sup>5</sup>** I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. **6**His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. **7**And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. **<sup>8</sup>** So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed,*<sup>2</sup>* and I retained no strength. **9**Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.

**<sup>10</sup>**And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. **11**And he said to me, "O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. **12**Then he said to me, "Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words. **13**The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, **<sup>14</sup>** and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come."

**<sup>15</sup>**When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute. **16**And behold, one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, "O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. **17**How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me."

**18**Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. **19**And he said, "O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage." And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me." **20**Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to

fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. **21**But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.

<span id="page-135-5"></span><span id="page-135-4"></span><span id="page-135-3"></span>Weakened by weeks of fasting and prayer, Daniel is overwhelmed when a glorious being appears to him (10:2–3, 8–9). God had heard Daniel's prayer and sent the heavenly messenger, but the messenger had battled three weeks with the spiritual prince of Persia (10:11–13). Finally, however, the messenger arrives with a word of revelation concerning the future of God's people and earthly kingdoms (10:14; 11:2–12:3). Daniel becomes mute and weak at the messenger's words (10:15–18) and needs strength and reassurance (10:18–19). The heavenly figure then discloses the fact of present and future spiritual warfare (10:20–11:1).

Its unity is clear in that the heavenly figure who appears to Daniel (10:1–11:1) and speaks a word of revelation about the future (11:2–12:3) also gives closing instructions and hope (12:4–13). From its first to its last verse, we must hold Daniel 10–12 together as a single unit. Its content pertains mainly to future Greek kings and, most importantly, to a blasphemous king who would one day arise: Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Given the fact that the visions of chapters 8–12 are <span id="page-136-8"></span><span id="page-136-5"></span>arranged in an A-B-A' format, we should note that the message of chapters 10–12 parallels chapter 8, though in a much lengthier fashion.

<span id="page-136-14"></span><span id="page-136-11"></span>Daniel 10:1–11:1 is the first main section of chapters 10–12. After mourning and fasting, Daniel encounters a heavenly figure who appears to him (10:2–7) and strengthens him (10:8–11:1). The encounter was probably a preincarnate appearance of the Son of God. Much of 10:1–11:1 is spent on the debilitating and overwhelming effects of the encounter on Daniel. Probably only one heavenly figure is in view throughout this encounter.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-136-9"></span>10:1 Daniel's final vision in the book occurred in "the third year of Cyrus king of Persia," approximately 536 BC.65 This was the Medo-Persian ruler who conquered Babylon and granted the Jews a return to their land in 538. If Daniel had been deported as a young teenager in 605, he would have been in his eighties in 536. The mention of "Belteshazzar" recalls the fact that Daniel had been renamed according to the name of Nebuchadnezzar's god (1:7; 4:8).

<span id="page-136-15"></span><span id="page-136-7"></span><span id="page-136-3"></span>Chapter 10 begins with third-person narration: "A word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar." The "word" refers primarily to the content of 11:2–12:3. The author tells the reader that "the word was true" (reliable) and concerned "a great conflict." The section 11:2–12:3 will describe this coming conflict in great detail. The assertion that Daniel "understood the word and had understanding of the vision" is placed at the beginning of the chapter in light of what follows. Daniel's understanding would be limited: with the help of the heavenly figure, Daniel would know that the word concerned the future and foretold coming conflicts, that God's people would be wrapped up in these conflicts, and that the wicked would be judged and the saints vindicated.

<span id="page-136-10"></span>10:2–3 The narration shifts to the first person: "In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks." He expressed his mourning by abstaining from meat and wine ("delicacies") as well as from personal maintenance ("nor did I anoint myself") for those three weeks. Oil was part of daily hygiene, and after a period of mourning was completed, the mourner would resume the use of oil on his head and body (cf. 2 Sam. 14:2; Isa. 61:3). Fasting from meat and wine probably meant he subsisted on water and other food.66 In light of the time noted in Daniel 10:4 ("the twentyfourth day" of Nisan), Daniel's three-week fast would have involved abstaining from meat and wine during Passover, which was Nisan 14–15 (cf. Ex. 12:1–6).

<span id="page-136-13"></span><span id="page-136-12"></span><span id="page-136-1"></span><span id="page-136-0"></span>10:4–6 On the twenty-fourth day of Nisan, Daniel "was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)." The only other mention of that river in the OT

<span id="page-136-6"></span><span id="page-136-4"></span><span id="page-136-2"></span><sup>65</sup> The vision of chapter 9 was set in the *first* year of that king, assuming Darius and Cyrus are the same person. 66 The notion of abstaining from meat and wine may be meant to recall the first chapter of the book, where, after arriving in Babylon, Daniel rejected meat and wine from the king's table (Dan. 1:8–15). But since 10:3 specified that he abstained from meat and wine for three weeks, he apparently ate and drank such fare on earlier and later occasions. In chapters 1 and 10, therefore, when he abstained from meat and wine for a period of time, it was for a specific spiritual reason.

<span id="page-137-0"></span>is in Genesis 2:14, a connection that may be important due to the Adamic experience Daniel will have later in this chapter.

<span id="page-137-11"></span><span id="page-137-7"></span>Beside this river Daniel beheld "a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist" (Dan. 10:5). This first description concerns the figure's apparel. The man was clothed literally in "linens," and elsewhere in the OT the plural "linens" occurs in Ezekiel 9–10 (cf. 9:2–3, 11; 10:2, 6–7), where a glorious angelic figure is also described. The location "Uphaz" occurs in Jeremiah 10:9, where it is again mentioned as a source of fine gold. The golden sash (or belt) around the waist appears on one other person in Scripture: the risen and exalted Christ as he appears to the apostle John in the book of Revelation (1:13).

<span id="page-137-17"></span><span id="page-137-8"></span><span id="page-137-5"></span><span id="page-137-3"></span>Daniel shifted his focus from the priestly figure's attire to its appearance. He saw a body like beryl, a face like lightning, eyes like torches, arms and legs like burnished bronze, and a voice like the sound of a multitude. The term translated "beryl" could also refer to yellow jasper. The high priest wore this gem on his breastplate (Ex. 28:20), and it appeared in the garden of Eden as well (Ezek. 28:13). The figure's face appeared glorious, majestic, even frightening. Lightning often accompanied a theophany (cf. Ex. 20:18), which may suggest divinity here in Daniel 10. The flaming eyes denoted a piercing gaze and all-encompassing vision. The arms and legs appeared strong, and the "sound of a multitude" indicated a powerful and mighty voice (cf. Ezek. 1:24).

<span id="page-137-10"></span><span id="page-137-9"></span><span id="page-137-6"></span><span id="page-137-2"></span>By way of identifying this figure, note that Daniel has never described what an angel wore or looked like (cf. 7:16; 8:16–17; 9:21). The description of 10:5–6, therefore, is unprecedented if the figure is an angel. Furthermore, according to 9:21, the figure Daniel encountered in 7:16 was Gabriel, the figure in 8:16 is called Gabriel, and in 9:21 the bearer of revelation is again Gabriel. Significantly, there is no identification of the figure in 10:5–6 as Gabriel.

<span id="page-137-15"></span><span id="page-137-14"></span><span id="page-137-4"></span><span id="page-137-1"></span>According to 10:20–21, the figure who appeared to Daniel in verses 5–6 was a warrior. While not identified as Gabriel, the figure was clearly not Michael, for he spoke of "Michael, your prince," in verse 21. Possibly the heavenly figure in verses 5–6 was the angel of Yahweh. Since the angel of Yahweh may be rightly understood as a divine figure (cf. Gen. 16:7–11; Ex. 3:2–6; Judg. 2:1; 6:11–14; 13:3–22), Daniel was encountering not a mere angelic messenger but the preincarnate Son of God. If this was the preincarnate second person of the Trinity, John's use of Daniel 10:5–6 in Revelation 1:14–15 is most appropriate, because John encountered the risen Jesus: "His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters." Knowing the book of Daniel, John described Jesus by alluding to Daniel 10:5–6. Such usage may be sufficient to identify the figure in 10:5–6 as the divine Son of God.

<span id="page-137-16"></span><span id="page-137-13"></span><span id="page-137-12"></span>10:7 Daniel was not alone by the Tigris River; there were other men with him. Yet "I, Daniel, alone saw the vision," and the men did not. But they knew something supernatural was afoot, so "they fled to hide themselves." In Acts 9:3–7, Saul also <span id="page-138-11"></span>experienced an encounter that his companions did not fully share. Interestingly, it was the risen Jesus whom Saul encountered (Acts 9:4–5; cf. 22:9–11).

<span id="page-138-0"></span>10:8–9 As the sole seer of the vision, Daniel lost his strength and radiant appearance, and the encounter filled him with fear. The sound of the words sent him into a deep sleep, with his face to the ground. If the Tigris River and the image of beryl already evoked the garden of Eden, the depiction of Daniel in a deep sleep would surely remind the reader of Adam (Gen. 2:21). Earlier, in the vision of chapter 8, Daniel had fallen into a deep sleep and had to be awakened by the one he encountered (Dan. 8:18). Daniel's reaction in 10:8–9 was more severe and extreme, however, than in any previous vision encounter with a heavenly being, and this strong reaction cohered with the overwhelming presence of a divine person.

<span id="page-138-7"></span><span id="page-138-3"></span><span id="page-138-2"></span>10:10–11 The figure touched Daniel and propped him up on shaking limbs. With weeks of fasting behind him, Daniel was already weakened, and now this theophany proved difficult to endure. This scene is similar to what the apostle John, who wrote of encountering the exalted Christ, experienced centuries later: seeing Christ, John fell down as though dead, and Jesus touched him in response (Rev. 1:17).

<span id="page-138-10"></span><span id="page-138-5"></span>The figure spoke words of reassurance to Daniel. As in Daniel 9:23, he was assured of God's love. The figure had "been sent" to speak the forthcoming revelation (11:2–12:3), so Daniel needed to stand up and receive it.67 And, after hearing the words of reassurance, Daniel rose, still trembling.

<span id="page-138-8"></span>10:12 The heavenly figure told Daniel to "fear not," for God had heard his prayers. Daniel's "words" of prayer had probably continued for the entire three weeks of mourning. The heavenly figure was God's answer to those persistent prayers.

<span id="page-138-9"></span><span id="page-138-4"></span><span id="page-138-1"></span>10:13–14 Daniel's encounter with this heavenly figure didn't occur until three weeks after he had started praying, because of the messenger's spiritual engagement with the "prince of the kingdom of Persia," who had "withstood [him] twenty-one days." "Prince" refers at times to an earthly ruler (cf. 9:6), but here a spiritual being is meant. "Of the kingdom of Persia" is consistent with the idea that kingdoms or nations have presiding angels (cf. Deut. 4:19; 32:8). The "prince of the kingdom of Persia" was probably a demonic angel who tried to prevent the answer to prayer. Nevertheless, Daniel's prayer was a factor, as seen by the overlapping time period: Daniel had been mourning and praying for three weeks, and the heavenly figure who appeared to him had been contending with the "prince of . . . Persia" for twenty-one days.

Apparently a demonic spirit had sought to intervene in what God was doing on earth, so we must consider what significant events were taking place during

<span id="page-138-6"></span><sup>67</sup> In Trinitarian terms, we understand in the NT that the Father sends the Son and the Son obeys the Father (cf. John 5:19–23). Reading this relationship into scenes like Daniel 10, it is possible to conceive of the heavenly figure as "sent" by the Father to Daniel as the preincarnate Son of God. With this lens in place, the fact that the figure is "sent" should not be used to nullify the plausibility of the figure's divine status.

<span id="page-139-2"></span><span id="page-139-1"></span>the period of Daniel's prayer (536 BC). In 538 BC the king of Medo-Persia (Cyrus/ Darius) allowed captive Jews to return to their land, and many did so (Ezra 1–2). But those who returned and commenced a rebuilding of the temple experienced opposition (Ezra 3–4), and unfortunately the rebuilding stopped. It would take the ministries of Haggai and Zechariah to spur on the project to completion. In the third year of Cyrus, then, a period of discouragement set in for the former exiles, and not just for them but for Daniel as well. Perhaps Daniel had heard that the returnees were not rebuilding the temple, and so his abiding concern for Jerusalem and God's people (Dan. 9:1–19) led him to mourn, fast, and pray.

<span id="page-139-4"></span><span id="page-139-0"></span>But no spiritual opposition could succeed against God's plan. His will would be done on earth as it was in heaven. Just as the angel of Yahweh was involved in the success of the Israelites who were once captive to Egypt but headed to the Promised Land as liberated people (Ex. 32:34; 33:2; Josh. 5:13–15), this figure would ensure victory for those who were once captive to Babylon. This new exodus could not be thwarted.

<span id="page-139-13"></span><span id="page-139-12"></span><span id="page-139-11"></span><span id="page-139-7"></span>The figure conversing with Daniel reported, "Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia" (Dan. 10:13). In the OT, Michael is mentioned by name only in the book of Daniel (cf. 10:21; 12:1), while in the NT he is named in the books of Jude and Revelation (Jude 9; Rev. 12:7–11). In Jude 9 Michael is called "the archangel." If the archangel Michael came to assist the heavenly figure who appeared to Daniel, then that figure was probably superior to Michael, a rank that further supports identifying the figure of Daniel 10:5–6 as the angel of Yahweh (as which we will subsequently refer to him). Michael would be helpful in the battle against the spiritual prince of Persia because of his role as "the great prince who has charge of your people" (12:1). This further substantiates understanding the conflict (10:13) as involving the nation of Israel, and the present difficulty facing the nation was probably their rebuilding project that had faced opposition and then had ceased.

<span id="page-139-5"></span>The angel's report that "I was left there with the kings of Persia" (10:13) may indicate he had prevailed over spiritual opposition throughout the reigns of multiple Persian kings. The warfare had reached a peak at this point, however. Perhaps Michael was handling the spiritual opposition while the angel of Yahweh appeared to Daniel in answer to prayer. The heavenly figure came to give understanding about "what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come" (10:14). The revelation in 11:2–12:3 encompassed distant events that would involve Israel.

<span id="page-139-9"></span><span id="page-139-8"></span><span id="page-139-6"></span>10:15–17 When Daniel heard that something would happen to his people in the latter days, he turned his face toward the ground "and was mute," again showing a physical reaction to what the figure said (cf. vv. 8–9, 11). Then "one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips" (v. 16), enabling him to speak (cf. Isa. 6:7).

<span id="page-139-10"></span><span id="page-139-3"></span>A disputed issue is whether this "one in the likeness of the children of man" (Dan. 10:16) is the same figure who appeared in verses 5–6. Possibly the one who <span id="page-140-18"></span><span id="page-140-10"></span><span id="page-140-7"></span><span id="page-140-4"></span>two notions found in verse 13 connecting the reader to the figure of verses 5–6.

<span id="page-140-5"></span><span id="page-140-0"></span>Daniel admitted to the heavenly being, "O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength" (v. 16). The distress of what Daniel had heard and seen once again left him severely weak (cf. v. 8). He confessed that he was too weak to converse with the figure, for he had no strength, nor even any breath. The address "my lord" is common in the OT, but other contextual factors may suggest a specific allusion to Joshua 5:14. In that scene, Joshua said "my lord" upon encountering the angel of Yahweh, fell down with his face to the ground, and referred to himself as the angel's "servant." Note that in Daniel 10:16–17, the prophet referred to the heavenly figure as "lord" and himself as a "servant," and multiple times Daniel put his face to the ground (vv. 9, 15). If Daniel indeed encountered the angel of Yahweh in chapters 10–12, this provides one further connection to Joshua 5:14, for Joshua met the angel as well.

<span id="page-140-14"></span><span id="page-140-13"></span><span id="page-140-12"></span><span id="page-140-6"></span><span id="page-140-3"></span><span id="page-140-2"></span>10:18–19 Having already touched Daniel's lips (v. 16), the person in the vision touched Daniel again to strengthen him (v. 18; cf. v. 10). Never had an encounter with an angel left Daniel so debilitated and weakened (cf. 7:16; 8:17–18; 9:21), and this extremely vulnerable and distraught condition further supports the idea that Daniel had encountered a divine figure.

<span id="page-140-9"></span><span id="page-140-8"></span><span id="page-140-1"></span>The figure once again assured Daniel of God's love (10:19; cf. v. 11) and commanded him to "fear not" (cf. v. 12). For the first time he pronounced "peace be with you" and called Daniel to "be strong and of good courage" (v. 19). This language (especially the combination of "peace" and "fear not") may recall Gideon's encounter with the angel of Yahweh: "Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die" (Judg. 6:11–23). In the NT, Jesus pronounced peace to his disciples on multiple occasions (Luke 24:36; John 20:19, 21, 26). When the heavenly figure had touched Daniel for the third time, Daniel was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me" (Dan. 10:19). The revelation would come in 11:2–12:3, but first the heavenly being had a question and answer for Daniel (10:20–11:1).

<span id="page-140-20"></span><span id="page-140-19"></span><span id="page-140-17"></span><span id="page-140-16"></span><span id="page-140-15"></span><span id="page-140-11"></span>10:20 The angel of Yahweh asked a rhetorical question: "Do you know why I have come to you?" According to verse 12 he had come in response to Daniel's prayer, and according to verse 14 he had come to reveal aspects of the future to Daniel. He added in verse 20, "I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come." Apparently the spiritual opposition would continue, and the role of this warrior would be integral to the success of God's plan. That this speaker referred to returning to fight the prince of Persia

<span id="page-141-4"></span>indicates he was identical to the one who spoke in verse 13, the man-like figure from verses 5–6.

The "prince of Greece" probably referred—like the "prince of the kingdom of Persia" in verse 13—to the evil demonic spirit over that earthly kingdom. Spiritual forces would continue warring in unseen ways, and the effects of those battles would have earthly consequences. The day would come when Greece would conquer Medo-Persia (cf. 8:7, 20–21).

<span id="page-141-5"></span><span id="page-141-1"></span>10:21 The heavenly figure prefaced the imminent revelation by saying, "I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth." Nowhere else in the Bible is the phrase "book of truth" used. It was probably equivalent to God's unwavering plan for the future, a book no one may open but into which God would occasionally grant insight or understanding. Part of what the book of truth disclosed was this: "There is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince." Michael the archangel was called "your prince," referring to the angel presiding over Israel. He contended beside the angel of Yahweh in spiritual warfare.

<span id="page-141-6"></span><span id="page-141-2"></span>11:1 The heavenly figure reported, "In the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him." This time reference confused people in the Middle Ages, who created a chapter division at this verse, although the vision that began in chapter 10 had not ended. The time reference ("in the first year of Darius the Mede") was not indicating a new subject or vision, although previous time references did function in that way (2:1; 7:1). Rather, the speaker was still speaking to Daniel, mentioning the first year of Darius to clarify when he (the heavenly figure) had strengthened Michael. In 10:21 the figure had spoken about Michael and then continued speaking of him in 11:1.

<span id="page-141-3"></span><span id="page-141-0"></span>The first year of Darius/Cyrus was when the Medo-Persians conquered the Babylonian Empire and permitted captive Jews to return to Jerusalem. These earthly events apparently had heavenly counterparts, for Michael was in the spiritual realm engaging in warfare and advancing God's plan. The heavenly figure of 10:5–6 had confirmed and strengthened Michael during that crucial time period. Michael, the archangel, was probably not strengthened by someone of lesser rank but by his superior—and the preincarnate Son of God would certainly be superior to the great archangel Michael.

## *Response*

<span id="page-141-7"></span>There is more to this world than meets the eye. Paul instructed the Ephesians, "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Eph. 6:11–12). Spiritual warfare, veiled yet consequential, is unavoidable and must be engaged—and engaged with the weaponry Paul describes. He calls his readers to "stand" against

<span id="page-142-8"></span><span id="page-142-7"></span>the Devil's schemes with defensive armor (vv. 14–17) and the offensive "sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (v. 17).

<span id="page-142-1"></span><span id="page-142-0"></span>In Daniel 10 we are reminded that spiritual warfare is not an exclusively NT phenomenon. In response to Daniel's prayer, God immediately sent a heavenly messenger to bring a word of revelation, but the "prince of the kingdom of Persia" held up this messenger for three weeks (v. 13). The messenger said he would return to fight "against the prince of Persia" once more, and soon the "prince of Greece will come" (v. 20). Daniel's visitor also called the angel Michael "your prince" (v. 21). These spiritual princes refer to angels warring in the heavenly places, a warfare with earthly consequences. Even in Daniel's day the struggle was against more than flesh and blood.

<span id="page-142-13"></span><span id="page-142-2"></span>At first glance, this section in the book of Daniel seems to validate the popular notion of "territorial spirits," for an evil "prince" (or angel) presided over Persia and another over Greece. How widespread are such spirits today? The Bible does not state that every territory on earth has an evil spirit that dominates it. Yet the actions of nations can involve devilish schemes and can be stimulated by devilish activity (cf. Rev. 13:2). Believers should not presume to spot a demon behind every bush, but neither should we assume that demons are dormant. It is important to remember that major events of Israel's history were unfolding in Daniel's day, and it seems such actions met demonic resistance. The ministry of Jesus was certainly a pivot point in salvation history, as promises and prophecies were finding their fulfillment—and consider the frequency with which Jesus encountered demonic spirits in the Gospel accounts (e.g., Matt. 4:24; 8:28–34; 9:32–34; 10:1, 7–8; 12:22–23; 17:14–20)!

<span id="page-142-10"></span><span id="page-142-4"></span><span id="page-142-3"></span>Being post-cross and post-resurrection, believers may rejoice in Paul's declaration that God has "disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in" Christ (Col. 2:15). And though the Devil may presently prowl around like a roaring lion, seeking to devour God's image-bearers (1 Pet. 5:8), the "God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (Rom. 16:20).

<span id="page-142-12"></span><span id="page-142-11"></span><span id="page-142-9"></span><span id="page-142-6"></span><span id="page-142-5"></span>Prior to the final crushing of Satan, a key element in our spiritual warfare is prayer; we are to be "praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication" (Eph. 6:18). Daniel did not see the heavenly messenger battling the prince of Persia for three weeks, but Daniel persevered in prayer nonetheless. We do not see behind the spiritual veil in our daily lives, and we should not expect such an opportunity. The opportunity we do have every day, however, is to pray for God's strength, mercy, and compassion, because our great high priest in the heavens, the Lord Jesus Christ who came to defeat the Devil (Heb. 2:14), offers grace for our time of need (4:16). No principality can withstand Christ's power or overthrow his throne. In this world we will have trouble, but take heart: Jesus has overcome the world, the flesh, and the Devil (cf. John 16:33).

**<sup>2</sup>** "And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia, and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them. And when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece. **3**Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do as he wills. **4**And as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the authority with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these.

**<sup>5</sup>** "Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and shall rule, and his authority shall be a great authority. **6**After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement.

**<sup>10</sup>** "His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall keep coming and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress. **11**Then the king of the south, moved with rage, shall come out and fight against the king of the north. And he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand. **12**And when the multitude is taken away, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail. **13**For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the first. And after some years*<sup>2</sup>* he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies.

**<sup>14</sup>** "In those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the violent among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail. **15**Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city.

He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. **22**Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, even the prince of the covenant. **23**And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully, and he shall become strong with a small people. **24**Without warning he shall come into the richest parts*<sup>5</sup>* of the province, and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers' fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time. **25**And he shall stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him. **26**Even those who eat his food shall break him. His army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain. **27**And as for the two kings, their hearts shall be bent on doing evil.

This divided Greek kingdom will witness battles between the kings of the south and north (11:5–20), ultimately leading to the rise of a contemptible king (11:21) who will cause great turmoil for the Jewish people (11:21–45). But God will accomplish deliverance, even an end-time rescue from the dust through resurrection (12:1–3).

In 11:2–12:3, the heavenly figure provides the most detailed prophecy in the book. Its fulfillment lies in the distant future and pertains primarily to the Greek Empire and its various kings (cf. 11:3–45). Greek kings from the north and south will war against each other for many decades (11:5–20), culminating in the rise of a despicable and contemptible king: Antiochus IV Epiphanes (11:21). Most alarming will be his assaults against the Jewish people (11:21–35). The importance of this king to the vision will be evident by the amount of space allotted to his atrocities (11:21–35), and the final part of the vision (11:36–12:3) reinforces his importance by recapitulating those verses.

### <span id="page-146-14"></span><span id="page-146-13"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-146-6"></span><span id="page-146-5"></span><span id="page-146-3"></span>11:2 Saying "Now I will show you the truth," the heavenly figure alluded to the "book of truth" (cf. 10:21) soon to be partially disclosed to Daniel. Daniel learned that "three more kings shall arise in Persia, and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them" (11:2). After Cyrus, who was ruling Medo-Persia at the time of this prophecy (cf. 10:1), the next three kings were Cambyses (530–522 BC), Gaumata (522), and Darius I Hystaspes (522–486). The "fourth" after Cyrus was Xerxes I (486–465), known as Ahasuerus in the book of Esther. An established and wealthy king, Xerxes battled against "the kingdom of Greece" (11:2) but could not conquer it because the Greek city-states mounted strong resistance under Philip of Macedon (359–336).

<span id="page-146-8"></span><span id="page-146-7"></span><span id="page-146-1"></span>11:3–4 After the death of his father, Philip, Alexander the Great ("a mighty king") rose to power, ruling "with great dominion" and acting "as he wills." (v. 3). According to the vision of 8:7 and the interpretation in 8:20–21, this mighty Greek king would defeat the Medo-Persians. Coming to power in 336 BC, Alexander had conquered Persia by 331.

<span id="page-146-10"></span><span id="page-146-0"></span>After Alexander's death in 323 BC at age 32, "His kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the authority with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these" (11:4). Alexander's kingdom was divided posthumously among four of his generals (cf. 7:6; 8:8, 22): Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Cassander. These generals were not Alexander's descendants, and because of the empire's divisions, the rule of the respective generals was not as vast or great as Alexander's had been.

<span id="page-147-1"></span><span id="page-147-0"></span>The mention of a division "toward the four winds of heaven" (11:4) prepares the reader for the kings of "north" and "south" who will dominate much of chapter 11. Seleucus I Nicator ruled Syria and Mesopotamia ("the north"), and Ptolemy I Soter ruled Egypt and Palestine ("the south"). The kings of the north would be the Seleucids, while the kings of the south would be the Ptolemies. In the decades ahead, these dynasties would battle each other, with the territory of Judah caught in the middle.

<span id="page-147-2"></span>11:5 Beginning in this verse, only two of the four parts of the Greek kingdom will be in view. The heavenly figure spoke of "the king of the south" who would be strong but not as strong as one of his princes, who would rule with great authority. In history, this first king of the south was Ptolemy I. One of his generals (or "princes") was Seleucus I, who helped him in battle before becoming king himself. Seleucus acquired territory by defeating and killing Antigonus (in 301 BC) and became the first "king of the north." Seleucus's kingdom became even greater than Ptolemy's.

<span id="page-147-3"></span>11:6 Years passed before the kings of the north and south finally made an alliance. Seleucus and Ptolemy were no longer ruling, but their dynasties continued with two of their successors, Antiochus II and Ptolemy II, respectively. The alliance in 250 BC between the two kings involved "the daughter of the king of south." Ptolemy II's daughter was Berenice, and the agreement was that she would marry the king of the north, Antiochus II, and bear the next Seleucid ruler for the north. But the plan for an alliance fell apart when, in 246 BC, Antiochus II took back his former wife, Laodice (whom he had left for Berenice), who allegedly poisoned him. Laodice also arranged the murder of Berenice and Berenice's son. Berenice's father (Ptolemy II) died that year as well. In the words of this verse, "She [Berenice] shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he [Antiochus II] and his arm shall not endure, but she [Berenice] shall be given up, and her attendants [who brought her from Egypt], he who fathered her [Ptolemy II], and he [either Antiochus II or Ptolemy II] who supported her [Berenice] in those times."

<span id="page-147-5"></span><span id="page-147-4"></span>11:7–9 Though Berenice's father, Antiochus II, was dead, someone in her family ("from a branch from her roots") would rule in his place (v. 7). Her brother, Ptolemy III, rose to power in 246 BC. He waged war against Laodice's son, Seleucus II Callinicus, who had become king of the north (v. 7). Ptolemy III came against the north out of retaliation for the death of his sister Berenice. He prevailed over the Syrian capital, Antioch, and in his campaign captured and killed Laodice.

<span id="page-147-7"></span><span id="page-147-6"></span>Ptolemy III, the "king of the south," also took spoils of war from the north: "their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold" (v. 8). He returned to Egypt to handle a rebellion, so "for some years" he refrained from attacking "the king of the north." As a result of Ptolemy III's return to Egypt, Seleucus II was able to regain territory, and in 242 BC he tried to invade Egypt ("shall come into the realm of the king of the south") but was not successful ("shall return to his own land"; v. 9).

<span id="page-148-0"></span>11:10 When Seleucus II died, two of his sons ruled after him: first, Seleucus III (227–223 BC), and second, Antiochus III (223–187). Seleucus III had a short reign and was assassinated during a military campaign by members of his own army. But, like his murdered brother, Antiochus III worked to "wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall keep coming and overflow and pass through." The language denoted successful military campaigns. Antiochus III became known as "the Great."

In the south, in 221 BC, the king was no longer Ptolemy III but now Ptolemy IV. Antiochus III, the king of the north, decided to come against Ptolemy IV and "again shall carry the war as far as his fortress." Antiochus III's campaign in Palestine during this time fulfilled the prophecy that he would carry the war as far as the fortress of the king of the south (Ptolemy III).

<span id="page-148-2"></span><span id="page-148-1"></span>11:11–13 In response to the provocations of the northern king, "the king of the south, moved with rage, shall come out and fight" (v. 11). Ptolemy IV ("the king of the south") launched such a counterattack in 217 BC. Though Antiochus III ("the king of the north") had a "great multitude," his army was given into the hands of Ptolemy IV (v. 11). The passive "it shall be given" reminds us that God was sovereign over the skirmishes between the Greek kings. Ptolemy IV prevailed over the king of the north.

<span id="page-148-3"></span>After Ptolemy IV's victory, his heart became exalted (v. 12). According to Polybius, Ptolemy suffered rebellions in Egypt, which may have fulfilled the prophecy that "he shall cast down tens of thousands" (v. 12). But his reign would not last. In 204 BC, under mysterious circumstances, Ptolemy IV died at the age of 35. This was the opportunity that the king of the north, Antiochus III, was looking for. According to the heavenly figure's words, "The king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the first. And after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies" (v. 13). Antiochus III was more than ready to invade and conquer, and his new nemesis, Ptolemy V, was only five years old. As a result of a decisive battle in 200, Antiochus III seized control of southern Syria and Palestine. That territory would thereafter be under Seleucid power.

<span id="page-148-4"></span>11:14 The angel of Yahweh explained to Daniel that things would not go well for the king of the south. With the victory of the king of the north imminent (cf. v. 13), the last years of the king of the south would be plagued with rebellion: "In those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the violent among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail" (v. 14). Rebellions began in Egypt before Ptolemy IV had died, and they continued into the reign of young Ptolemy V. Even violent Jews ("among your own people") would be involved in siding against the king of the south.

<span id="page-148-6"></span><span id="page-148-5"></span>11:15 The exploits of the king of the north became more specified: he "shall come and throw up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city." As events unfolded in the career of Antiochus III, the "well-fortified city" was probably Sidon. He besieged

the city and forced it to surrender in 198 BC. As the heavenly figure predicted, "The forces of the south shall not stand, or even his best troops, for there shall be no strength to stand." The siege resulted in a famine, leaving the Sidonians without strength to combat the onslaught of Antiochus and his forces.

<span id="page-149-2"></span><span id="page-149-1"></span><span id="page-149-0"></span>11:16–17 The heavenly figure described the king of the north in terms reminiscent of Alexander the Great: "He who comes against him shall do as he wills, and none shall stand before him" (v. 16; cf. v. 3). The king of the south would go against him, but none could resist the king of the north. Antiochus III would enter Israel and be victorious: "He shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand" (v. 16; cf. 8:9 for the language of "glorious land" and Ezek. 20:6, 15 for similar language). Now the Jews were under Seleucid, not Ptolemaic, rule. This change of power would mean terrible things for their future, because a descendant of Antiochus III would arise and commit atrocities in the land, a man named Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

<span id="page-149-3"></span>Antiochus III would need a strategy for dealing with opposition in Egypt. According to the angel of Yahweh, "He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of an agreement and perform them" (Dan. 11:17). Rather than invading Egypt, Antiochus III offered his daughter, Cleopatra, to Ptolemy V as a wife. He gave her to Ptolemy V "to destroy the kingdom, but it shall not stand or be to his advantage." Antiochus's plan did not succeed, for Cleopatra was loyal to Ptolemy V, her husband. When Ptolemy died in 182 BC, Cleopatra became the leading power in Egypt.

<span id="page-149-5"></span><span id="page-149-4"></span>11:18–19 Antiochus III refused to be stopped, despite the failure of his plan for Cleopatra. "Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many of them" (v. 18)—in 196 BC he went toward Thrace (a peninsula in modern-day Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria). This activity caught the attention of Rome, who sent warnings not to attack Greece itself. Ignoring the Roman warnings, Antiochus III maintained his course. In response, Rome sent a consul named Lucius Cornelius Scipio, "a commander" who "shall put an end to his insolence" (v. 18). Antiochus III was defeated at Thermopylae in 191 and at Magnesia in 190 and was made a vassal of Rome in 188 according to the Treaty of Apamea. According to the arrangement, he was to send twenty hostages to Rome, one of which was his son Antiochus IV. Antiochus III turned back toward his own land, just as the heavenly figure had predicted (v. 19). In 187 he attempted to pillage a temple of Zeus at Elymais (in modern-day Iraq) in order to pay his tribute to Rome, but the local populace defended the sanctuary and killed Antiochus (v. 19).

<span id="page-149-7"></span><span id="page-149-6"></span>11:20 Two of Antiochus III's sons would eventually rule his kingdom: Antiochus IV and Seleucus IV. The former was a hostage in Rome, so Seleucus IV became king (187–175 BC) when Antiochus III died. According to the prophecy of the angel of Yahweh, Antiochus III's successor "shall send an exactor of tribute for the glory of the kingdom. But within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle." Because he inherited his father's debt, Seleucus IV sought to pay it. He sent his finance minister, Heliodorus, to Jerusalem to seize wealth from its treasury. Heliodorus was unsuccessful, supposedly thwarted by angelic intervention (cf. *2 Macc.* 3:14–40). Seleucus's reign ended "neither in anger nor in battle" in 175, when Heliodorus poisoned him. These events set up the rise of the terrible king, whom the heavenly figure would prophesy about next.

<span id="page-150-0"></span>11:21 In place of Seleucus "shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given." This person was Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who ruled from 175 to 164 BC. "He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries," a prophecy fulfilled when people who should have ruled after Seleucus were removed. At first Antiochus was coregent with another son of Seleucus, but the latter was murdered in 170, leaving Antiochus solely in power.

<span id="page-150-2"></span><span id="page-150-1"></span>11:22–24 The picture of "armies" being "utterly swept away before him and broken" depicted the seemingly unstoppable spread of Antiochus IV's power. And "even the prince of the covenant" would be broken, probably referring to the Jewish high priest. Under the previous reign of Antiochus III, Jews had been granted the right of self-government according to Jewish law. The particular "prince of the covenant" of verse 22 was probably Onias III, whom Antiochus IV despised for resisting the influence of Hellenism in the land. When Onias's brother Jason professed support for Hellenization and offered Antiochus IV a bribe, Antiochus deposed Onias and installed Jason in his place (*2 Macc.* 4:7–10). Then, in 172 BC, Menelaus, who was not from a high priestly family, presented an even larger bribe to Antiochus, and as a result he replaced Jason as high priest (*2 Macc.* 4:23–26).

<span id="page-150-3"></span>This contemptible king (Antiochus IV) would make "an alliance" and then "act deceitfully," becoming "strong with a small people" (Dan. 11:23). From what can be discerned historically, it is not certain which alliance is meant, for Antiochus both made and broke many. But perhaps his deals for the high priesthood (with either Jason or Menelaus) fulfilled this prophecy. The "small people" may refer to Jews in Jerusalem who apostatized and sided with him.

Antiochus raided treasuries ("He shall come into the richest parts of the province"; v. 24), acting more greedily than his forebears ("He shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers' fathers have done"). He also spread spoils around, "scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods" (v. 24; cf. *1 Macc.* 3:30). The campaigns of Antiochus's forces would involve "plans against strongholds, but only for a time" (Dan. 11:24), probably referring to the region of Egypt that would be dealt with in subsequent verses. "Only for a time" denoted God's sovereignty over the horrific career of Antiochus, a reign that, despite its terrors, would not exceed what had been divinely decreed.

<span id="page-150-6"></span><span id="page-150-5"></span><span id="page-150-4"></span>11:25–28 Antiochus IV "shall stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army" (v. 25); he would set his sights on Egypt in 170–169 BC. Though the "king of the south" (Ptolemy VI, son of Cleopatra) <span id="page-151-2"></span><span id="page-151-1"></span>would battle against Antiochus with a great army, his efforts would not be successful; Ptolemy's plans were leaked to the opponents, and he was captured while attempting to flee (v. 25). Due to poor counsel and disloyal subjects, Ptolemy VI was no match for the aggression and assaults of Antiochus IV. The prophecy that "Even those who eat his food shall break him" (v. 26) was probably fulfilled when two of Ptolemy's counselors, Eulaeus and Lenaeus, advised him to seize Palestine back from Seleucid control. Ptolemy's army would be swept away in this attempt, with many slain (v. 26).

Though Antiochus IV controlled most of Egypt, he did not control Alexandria, where the people declared Ptolemy VII (the younger brother of Ptolemy VI) king. In a plan to expand his Egyptian control, Antiochus decided to collude with the defeated Ptolemy VI. The "two kings" planned "on doing evil," sitting at the same table and speaking lies to each other regarding agreements they had no intention of keeping (v. 27). Antiochus IV's plans fell through when Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VII were unexpectedly reconciled and became coregents in Egypt. The heavenly figure told Daniel that Antiochus IV's plan would be "to no avail, for the end is yet to be at the time appointed" (v. 27).

<span id="page-151-4"></span><span id="page-151-3"></span>Nevertheless, Antiochus IV plundered Egypt, concluding his first successful campaign there in 169 BC without capturing Alexandria. As he went to Syria, he passed through Jerusalem and sensed an insurrection; in response, he stole treasure from the temple (*1 Macc.* 1:20–24). He would return to his land with great wealth indeed (Dan. 11:28). But his heart was set against the Jewish people because the insurrection apparently involved Jason's trying to reinstitute himself as high priest, having heard a rumor that Antiochus was killed in Egypt. Antiochus stopped the rebellion, massacring eighty thousand people (cf. *2 Macc.* 5:12–14). He worked his will before returning to his own land (Dan. 11:28)—invading, plundering, and massacring.

<span id="page-151-6"></span><span id="page-151-5"></span>11:29–30 Antiochus IV invaded Egypt again in 168 BC, just as the prophecy had predicted hundreds of years earlier: "At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south" (v. 29), but this time the campaign would not be successful. In Egypt, the united coregent brothers (Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VII) were against him, and "the ships of Kittim" came against him as well (v. 30), referring to Rome, which arrived at Egypt's request.68 The Roman proconsul Gaius Popillius Laenas confronted Antiochus IV and told him to leave Egypt alone. Antiochus left humiliated and "enraged" and decided to strengthen his grip on Palestine by taking action against the Jews (v. 30). Specifically, he would "pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant": apostate Jews. He used dissension to his advantage (cf. *1 Macc.* 1:29–35), bringing severe persecution to the Jewish people from 167 to 164 BC.

<span id="page-151-0"></span>Only one other place in the OT had connected "ships" with "Kittim" (Dan. 11:30): Balaam's oracle (Num. 24:24). Most likely the heavenly figure in Daniel 11 deliberately alluded to that oracle. In the historical events involving Antiochus, the

<span id="page-151-7"></span><sup>68</sup> The Septuagint of Daniel 11:30 translates "Kittim" as "Romans."

prophesied "ships of Kittim" turned out to be Rome, as noted above. The Roman Empire would be significant as the one during which the Messiah lived and died. And the very oracle that mentioned "ships of Kittim" earlier in the OT (Num. 24:24) prophesied a star coming out of Jacob and a scepter rising out of Israel (v. 17). Jesus was that rising star and scepter.

<span id="page-152-5"></span><span id="page-152-2"></span>11:31 During the Jewish persecution of 167–164 BC, Antiochus IV's forces profaned the temple fortress, ending the daily sacrifices and setting up "the abomination that makes desolate" (cf. 8:13). He sought the thorough Hellenization of Jerusalem and Judea. He forbade the Scriptures, circumcision, Jewish festivals, and sacrifices, all upon penalty of death (cf. *1 Macc.* 1:41–51, 56–67). On December 6, 167, the "abomination" was set up in the temple (*1 Macc.* 1:54). This was probably an idol of Zeus (cf. *2 Macc.* 6:1–2). Ten days later, on December 16, sacrifices—including pigs—were offered on the altar (*1 Macc.* 1:47, 59; *2 Macc.* 6:4).

<span id="page-152-11"></span><span id="page-152-10"></span><span id="page-152-9"></span><span id="page-152-3"></span><span id="page-152-1"></span>In Matthew 24, Jesus spoke about the coming destruction of the temple in AD 70 (Matt. 24:1–3). In this Olivet Discourse he alluded to "the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel" (Matt. 24:15). His language reflected passages such as Daniel 9:27 and 11:31. The important point is that while 11:31 was fulfilled when Antiochus IV Epiphanes desecrated the temple in 167 BC, Jesus saw that desolation as typological of what would happen under the Roman Empire in AD 70. Jesus had biblical precedent in the book of Daniel to view the two temple desecrations in that way, for, as we have seen, Daniel 8 spoke of a "little horn" in the Greek Empire, while Daniel 7 spoke of a "little horn" in the Roman Empire; and, as we have seen, the former "little horn" was a type of the latter. The language in 9:27 spoke of abomination and desolation, and we concluded there that the fulfillment of those words occurred in AD 70. Jesus knew that the coming destruction of Jerusalem was the fulfillment of the type laid out in chapters 8 and 11.

<span id="page-152-8"></span><span id="page-152-7"></span><span id="page-152-6"></span><span id="page-152-4"></span><span id="page-152-0"></span>11:32–33 The ruler (Antiochus IV) "shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant" (v. 32), as Jewish apostates would side with him even as he forbade Jewish practices. But not every Jew would capitulate: "The people who know their God shall stand firm and take action" (v. 32). Such faithful people preferred death to violating God's law (cf. *1 Macc.* 1:61–63). The actions of the faithful would include instructing the people, making them understand the abominable ways and impositions of Antiochus and encouraging them to remain faithful (Dan. 11:33). But this resistance would not be easy, for many would die ("stumble") by sword and fire, while others would be taken captive. Key resistance came from the priest Mattathias and his five sons: John, Simon, Judas (sometimes called Maccabeus, which may mean "the hammer"), Eleazar, and Jonathan. They headed the Maccabean rebellion (166–164 BC), which resulted in Jerusalem's recapture by the Jews and the temple's reestablishment. The recaptured temple was cleansed and then rededicated on December 14, 164—an event that became known as Hanukkah.

<span id="page-153-1"></span>11:34–35 During the Maccabean rebellion, the faithful who died were not the only ones holding to God's law; the movement was helped by others who were steadfast in obedience. However, those who joined the rebellion may have done so for reasons other than biblical faithfulness. The Maccabees began to kill those who had aligned themselves with the Seleucids (cf. *1 Macc.* 2:42–48).

<span id="page-153-2"></span>The heavenly figure revealed to Daniel one of God's purposes in decreeing persecution: those who led by example and were obedient ("the wise") died "so that they may be refined, purified, and made white, until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time" (Dan. 11:35). The persecution would purify the people as the unbelievers forsook Yahweh while the believers held fast to him. The persecution by Antiochus IV became a threshing floor separating wheat from chaff. And, on the last day, all believers will be dressed in white, depicting faithfulness and allegiance to God (Rev. 3:5; cf. 4:4).

<span id="page-153-9"></span>Table 1.14 shows the Greek kings discussed so far, divided into the kings of the south (the Ptolemies) and of the north (the Seleucids):

| Kings of the South (Ptolemies)  | Kings of the North (Seleucids)      |  |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--|
| Ptolemy I Soter (323–285 BC)    | Seleucus I Nicator (312–280 BC)     |  |

<span id="page-153-0"></span>TABLE 1.14: Greek Kings Discussed in Comments on Daniel 11:2–35

<span id="page-153-8"></span><span id="page-153-7"></span><span id="page-153-6"></span><span id="page-153-5"></span><span id="page-153-4"></span><span id="page-153-3"></span>11:36–45 This is the most difficult section of the vision, for several reasons. First, the subject in verses 36–39 is "the king," a title not heretofore used by itself, and then in verse 40 the language of "king of the south" and "king of the north" resumes. Second, although Antiochus IV has been in view from verses 21–35, the content of verses 36–45 is difficult to line up with what is known historically of Antiochus's career (if the verses pick up chronologically after vv. 36–39), so perhaps another figure is being introduced. Third, if a different figure is being introduced in verses 36–45, the fulfillment would be later than the Greek Empire, perhaps in the Roman Empire or even in a future Antichrist. Fourth, the heavenly revelation continues to 12:3, so determining the time period of 11:36–45 is significant because 12:1 points to a deliverance by Michael "at that time. . . . of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time," and reference to this future "time" will be followed by a promise of resurrection (12:2–3).

Admittedly, navigating 11:36–45 is a thorny journey, so let us offer some preliminary conclusions before looking at the verses more closely. First, as we will contend, "the king" of verses 36–45 is Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Second, the uncertainty of some referents in verses 36–45 does not justify a future Antichrist interpretation, a reading assuming fulfillment thousands of years after Daniel wrote his prophecy — indeed, since Antichrist proponents argue that the Antichrist has not yet appeared, the fulfillment of verses 36–45 is, according to their view, still to come. Third, because of certain parallels between 11:36–12:3 and 11:21–35, we will demonstrate exegetically that 11:36–12:3 is a recapitulation of that earlier passage. Daniel 11:36–12:3 covers the same content as 11:21–35, condensing certain parts and elaborating on others.69 Recognizing the use of recapitulation will prevent us from concluding that 11:36–45 was false prophecy concerning the career of Antiochus and will render unnecessary the instinct of many interpreters to project fulfillment of 11:36–45 to the era of a future Antichrist.

<span id="page-154-7"></span><span id="page-154-5"></span><span id="page-154-2"></span>11:36 This and the following verses occur in the context of the persecuting king of verses 21–35, and there is no indication that a new ruler—besides the one we have identified as Antiochus IV—is now in view.70 Nor is any new time indicator given at the start of the verse. The articular "the king" probably refers to the ruler previously described. This king "shall do as he wills. He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods" (v. 36). Antiochus IV took the name "Epiphanes," meaning "God manifest," suggesting his attitude of self-importance and self-exaltation.

<span id="page-154-1"></span>The practice of doing "as he wills" matches that of a predecessor in verse 16, Antiochus III. The language ultimately echoes verse 3, however, which may suggest that Antiochus III and IV would both be in the mold of mighty Alexander the Great, doing whatever they pleased. Antiochus IV continued to prosper until his indignation was accomplished, for what God had decreed would come to pass. This "indignation" was probably fulfilled with the atrocities against, and desecration of, the Jerusalem temple in 167 BC.

<span id="page-154-9"></span>11:37–38 In order to more strongly emphasize the self-worship of the blasphemous king, the heavenly figure explained further, "He shall pay no attention to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women" (v. 37). Antiochus

<span id="page-154-3"></span><sup>69</sup> Steinmann argues that the descriptions of the figures in 11:21–35 and 11:36–45 are parallel, for both begin with a general description of reign and events largely unrelated to warfare; in both cases this is followed by descriptions of warfare; in both passages there is an assault against Egypt and an entrance into Palestine, followed by a second engagement with Egypt and entrance into Palestine (Steinmann, *Daniel*, 545). Yet he does not believe both passages speak of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. He insists that 11:21–35 is about Antiochus IV but 11:36–45 is about an eschatological Antichrist. If we grant that 11:36–12:3 is a recapitulation and slight compression of what is prophesied in 11:21–35, identifying the figure in both passages as Antiochus IV Epiphanes is not only more plausible but also more probable.

In the earlier part of the chapter, there are clear signals that the narrator moves from one king to the next (cf. vv. 2, 7, 20–21), but not in the present section. Here we have the primary textual reason why we cannot simply rule out of court the argument that verses 36–45 continue the 'prophecy' of Antiochus Epiphanes" (Tremper Longman III, *Daniel*, NIVAC [Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1999], 281).

<span id="page-155-1"></span>replaced Apollo with Zeus as the god of the Seleucids. The god beloved by women may be Tammuz, a deity worshiped by women (cf. Ezek. 8:14), or perhaps one specially favored in Egypt, such as Adonis or Dionysus — gods that Antiochus minimized. More than attending to idols, though, this king would magnify himself (Dan. 11:37).

<span id="page-155-9"></span><span id="page-155-8"></span>Antiochus's false worship would also involve honoring "the god of fortresses" a god "his fathers did not know"—with "gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts" (v. 38). This may suggest the king would honor an unconventional deity, although verse 38 could be depicting his idols to be military power and dominion (cf. Hab. 1:11). If the king worshiped himself and the spread of his military power, then the "gold and silver" and "precious stones and costly gifts" might represent his financial and material investment in building his empire.

<span id="page-155-11"></span><span id="page-155-10"></span>11:39 The depiction of the self-exalting king going against "the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god" may have been fulfilled by Antiochus's various acts against Jerusalem and Judea. Some Jews apostatized and sided with him. If these Jews acknowledged Antiochus (who blasphemed Yahweh), this transfer of allegiance meant turning against their God as well. People like Jason and Menelaus sought to bribe Antiochus IV for the high priesthood (cf. v. 22), which may have fulfilled the prophecy that "He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price" (v. 39). Antiochus also won over the Tobiads, who furthered his cause in Jerusalem, and he made it possible for them to hold civil and religious power there.

With the previous comments in view, it is plausible to consider verses 36–39 to be a recapitulation of verses 21–24. These sections have at least the following seven elements in common (table 1.15).

<span id="page-155-0"></span>TABLE 1.15: Possible Parallels between Daniel 11:21–24 and 11:36–39

<span id="page-156-9"></span><span id="page-156-1"></span>These parallels are not incidental but are meant to highlight a pattern of recapitulation. Having already described the blasphemous king in verses 21–24, the heavenly figure described him again in verses 36–39.

<span id="page-156-10"></span><span id="page-156-8"></span><span id="page-156-5"></span><span id="page-156-4"></span>11:40 The heavenly figure now began a recapitulation of Antiochus's deeds and conquests that verses 25–35 had delineated. These verses are set at the "time of the end," a concept seen in verse 27 ("the end is yet to be at the time appointed") and in verse 35 ("until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time") as well. In verse 40 the heavenly revealer was probably referring to the period of persecution against the Jews that would lead to the destruction of many and the desecration of their temple.

<span id="page-156-2"></span>As in verse 25, the speaker in verse 40 mentioned "the king of the south." This king attacked "him," identified in the next phrase as the "king of the north." who would "rush upon" the king of the south "like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships." This parallels verse 25, in which the king of the north came against the king of the south "with a great army" (fulfilled in 170–169 BC). In verse 40, we read that the king of the north "shall come into countries and shall overflow and pass through," language describing his continual movement. If the events of verses 25–27 are in fact being recapitulated, this must describe Antiochus IV passing through Judea on his way back to Syria.

<span id="page-156-11"></span><span id="page-156-3"></span>11:41 Heading to Syria, Antiochus came "into the glorious land"—Judea and, specifically, Jerusalem. When he saw an insurrection developing, he stopped it. According to the heavenly figure, "tens of thousands shall fall," which was fulfilled when Antiochus massacred eighty thousand people (cf. *2 Macc.* 5:12–14). When the heavenly figure declared that "these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites" (Dan. 11:41), the point was probably that the Jewish people would be the focus of Antiochus's fury, while recognized enemies of Yahweh would escape destruction.71 In Jeremiah 25:21, "Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon" are mentioned as those who would face the destruction of Yahweh, but now in Daniel 11:41 the enemies of Yahweh would see the Jews, God's people, persecuted.

<span id="page-156-12"></span><span id="page-156-7"></span><span id="page-156-0"></span>11:42–43 The king of the north (Antiochus IV) "shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape." The king would come against the south again, recapitulating the events of verse 29, in which he returned to Egypt in 168 BC for further invasion and dominion. He would "become ruler of the treasures of gold and silver, and all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and the Cushites shall follow in his train" (v. 43). Antiochus had plundered Egypt in 169 BC (cf. v. 28). He was the ruler of their treasure, and he may have plundered more during this second engagement with that territory. Further, his presence

<span id="page-156-13"></span><span id="page-156-6"></span><sup>71</sup> At the time of Antiochus's reign, Moab was no longer a nation, but that fact does not contradict this point. The name Moab, along with Ammon and Edom, is employed here to represent enemies of God's people.

and reputation apparently led people from nearby regions (Libya and Ethiopia) to align with him ("follow in his train").

<span id="page-157-3"></span>11:44 While Antiochus IV would gain followers from Libya and Ethiopia, which were located west and south of Egypt, "news from the east and the north shall alarm him." To the east were Judea and Syria, while to the north was Rome. Rome intervened when its representative, proconsul Gaius Popillius Laenas, confronted Antiochus IV and told him to leave Egypt alone. The words of verse 44 have recapitulated verse 30, in which "the ships of Kittim" came against him and forced him to withdraw and turn back.

"News from the east and the north" may have another plausible interpretation. If the directions were to be combined into a single source of news, then from Antiochus's position in Egypt the northeast would probably have been Jerusalem. The "news" that may have disturbed him was the fact that Jason—believing a rumor that Antiochus had been killed in Egypt—had returned to Jerusalem and led a rebellion against Menelaus and the Tobiads (cf. *2 Macc.* 5:5–10). Jason's action was an attempt to undermine the authorities Antiochus had appointed.

<span id="page-157-0"></span>Continuing the recapitulation of Daniel 11:30, Antiochus IV "shall go out with great fury to destroy and devote many to destruction" (v. 44). After his humiliation in Egypt, Antiochus went to Palestine and took action against the Jews. The years of 167–164 BC were a period of intense persecution. Antiochus forbade Jewish practices like circumcision and festival observances, outlawed copies of the Scriptures, set up an idol in the Jerusalem temple, and offered unclean animals on the altar. The people were oppressed and their temple desecrated. Some Jews apostatized and joined Antiochus's regime, while others remained faithful to Yahweh and refused to compromise their faith; as punishment, many of these faithful died.

<span id="page-157-6"></span><span id="page-157-2"></span>11:45 The prophecy that the king of the north "shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain" continued the terrible news of verse 44 that Antiochus IV would come against God's people with fury and the intent to destroy. The language of "glorious holy mountain" echoed the "glorious land" from verse 41. Not merely the city but the function and holiness of the temple as well were in his sinister sights. He set up his encampment, denoted here as "palatial tents," against God's people, who suffered years of oppression and persecution. But the fury of Antiochus IV would be short-lived. Indeed, "He shall come to his end, with none to help him." While warring against the Parthians, Antiochus IV died of disease in 164 BC.72

<span id="page-157-8"></span><span id="page-157-7"></span><span id="page-157-5"></span><span id="page-157-4"></span><span id="page-157-1"></span><sup>72</sup> For some scholars the statement of the king's death in 11:45 precludes an identification of Antiochus IV because they believe the encampment of verse 45a must be the place of death in verse 45b, and everyone knows Antiochus did not die in Palestine. This seems to rest on an unnecessary assumption. If verses 44–45 are a recapitulation and compression of verses 30–33, it may be a gross overreading of the text to demand that the death reported in verse 45b happen in the region mentioned in verse 45a. It seems more reasonable to take verse 45b as a promise that Antiochus, despite his raging and blasphemy and destructive designs, would die. But note carefully that verse 45b *does not say where* he would die. The period of Jewish persecution was from 167 to 164 BC (which fulfilled vv. 44–45a), and his death occurred in 164 (which fulfilled v. 45b).

<span id="page-158-3"></span>12:1 During the terrible persecution inflicted by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, "Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people," shall arise. Michael was mentioned earlier in the vision when the angel of Yahweh told Daniel, "Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me" when the "prince of the kingdom of Persia" engaged in spiritual warfare for twenty-one days (10:13). That previous engagement was during the Medo-Persian reign, but the heavenly figure had said that "when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come" (10:20), suggesting spiritual warfare would continue into the reign of the next empire. The prophecy of 12:1 said that Michael would arise to defend Israel, and Israel certainly needed to be defended against the terrible suffering and outrageous desolation committed by Antiochus.

<span id="page-158-9"></span><span id="page-158-4"></span>The heavenly figure described that time as "a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time." This language portrayed the horror of the years 167–164 BC. Since Jesus employed the "abomination of desolation"—set up by Antiochus IV—as a precursor for and type of the judgment against Jerusalem and its temple in AD 70, it is important to note that the language of 12:1 also appeared in the Olivet Discourse: "Then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be" (Matt. 24:21; cf. Mark 13:19). This extreme description is consistent with how past judgments against the temple were framed. In Jeremiah 30:7, Yahweh spoke concerning the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians: "Alas! That day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it." Just as Yahweh then promised deliverance (Jer. 30:8), the heavenly figure in Daniel 12:1 spoke of deliverance after an unprecedented distress, and Jesus in the Olivet Discourse promised deliverance after a time of great tribulation (Matt. 24:21–22, 30–31).73

<span id="page-158-10"></span><span id="page-158-8"></span><span id="page-158-6"></span>As noted, Jesus spoke about this "great tribulation" after foretelling "the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place" (Matt. 24:15). The proximity of the language of an "abomination of desolation" and "great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now" (Matt. 24:15, 21) supports the idea that Jesus was alluding to Daniel 11:21–12:3, a section that prophesied the tyrannical deeds of the king of the north (fulfilled by Antiochus) and the deliverance God provided at that crucial time.74

<span id="page-158-5"></span><span id="page-158-1"></span>With Michael defending Israel, the heavenly mediator promised, "At that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book" (12:1). The names in "the book" were the elect of God in the book of life (cf. references to this "book" in Ex. 32:32–33; Ps. 69:28; Rev. 3:5; 13:8). The promise was that God would deliver his people from the rage of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. If they were not spared from death, they would one day be delivered from death by bodily resurrection (Dan. 12:2). The rebellion of the Maccabees was probably the earthly expression of this spiritual battle. Mattathias and his sons led this

<span id="page-158-7"></span>73 Sam Storms rightly notes, "Neither those who used these terms in the Old Testament nor Jesus himself ever intended for such language to be pressed in such a way that it precluded the possibility for subsequent periods of equal or even more intense judgment to occur" (Sam Storms, *Kingdom Come: An Amillennial Alternative* [Fearn, UK: Mentor, 2013], 255). Cf. Exodus 11:6; 9:18; 10:14; Ezekiel 5:9; Daniel 9:12; 12:1; Joel 2:2.

<span id="page-158-2"></span><span id="page-158-0"></span><sup>74</sup> Of course, Daniel 9:27 may also be in view, but the relationship between 11:31 and 9:27 is typological and thus connected.

rebellion (166–164 BC), resulting in the city of Jerusalem being recaptured and its temple being renewed and reconsecrated.

<span id="page-159-12"></span>When Jesus used the language of 12:1 in the Olivet Discourse as he foretold the coming Roman destruction of Jerusalem, he also spoke of God's "elect" (Matt. 24:22, 24, 31) after speaking of an unprecedented time of "great tribulation" (24:21), and this order surely reflected Daniel 12:1, which spoke of God's elect after predicting "a time of trouble."

<span id="page-159-9"></span><span id="page-159-4"></span><span id="page-159-3"></span>If 11:36–12:3 is a recapitulation of 11:21–35, then the deliverance in 12:1 may correspond to the reassurance in 11:32, that "The people who know their God shall stand firm and take action," and in verse 34, that when the faithful stumble, "They shall receive a little help." The archangel Michael arose to defend the people, and the people rose up in resistance and in zealous commitment to God and his law.

<span id="page-159-14"></span><span id="page-159-11"></span><span id="page-159-1"></span><span id="page-159-0"></span>12:2–3 Compelling evidence for seeing recapitulation of 11:21–35 in 11:36–12:3 is the final verses of each section, which speak of what would happen to "many" and to the "wise." In 12:2, "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." Sleeping in the dust is a picture of death that harks back to Genesis 3:19 (for sleep as a metaphor for death, cf. Job 14:12; Pss. 13:3; 76:5; 90:5; Jer. 51:39, 57; 1 Thess. 4:14). According to the previous section, faithful believers during this time of tumult would die (Dan. 11:33–35), and thus the picture of people in the dust was appropriate. God's purposes in this tribulation were good: the faithful would be "refined, purified, and made white" (11:35). Daniel 12:2 held out ultimate hope for the vindication of these purified people: resurrection from the dead. God's good purpose would involve refining and raising his people.75

<span id="page-159-8"></span><span id="page-159-7"></span><span id="page-159-6"></span><span id="page-159-5"></span>The "many" of 12:2 may have initially referred to the faithful and unfaithful Jews during the persecution of Antiochus. Some Jews would walk wisely in obedience (11:32–33), but others would only seem to be following God when their hearts were in fact compromised (11:34). The final judgment would vindicate the righteous and punish the wicked, for some would be raised to everlasting life and others to everlasting shame (12:2). These resurrected states would be final.

Yet the promise that faithful and unfaithful Jews would be raised does not preclude the notion of all the faithful and unfaithful—Jews *and* Gentiles—being raised on the last day. God is no tribal deity; all nations of the earth are accountable to him. Indeed, Jesus made this very application of 12:2 when he declared, "An hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment" (John 5:28–29).76 Paul likewise clearly believed that Daniel 12:2 was not exclusive to Jews, for he spoke of a general resurrection

<span id="page-159-13"></span><span id="page-159-2"></span><sup>75</sup> Other OT passages such as Isaiah 26:19 and Psalm 49:15 also teach a hope of resurrection from the dead. For an exploration of how the hope of resurrection was rooted in Israel's worldview as early as the book of Genesis, see Mitchell L. Chase, "The Genesis of Resurrection Hope," *JETS* 57/3 (2014): 467–480.

<span id="page-159-10"></span><sup>76</sup> The fact that Jesus mentioned two groups—faithful and unfaithful—who would be raised from the dead is without question an allusion to Daniel 12:2, for no other OT text puts the hope so plainly for the righteous and the wicked.

<span id="page-160-4"></span>"of both the just and the unjust" (Acts 24:15). In Daniel 12:2, the language of "many"—divided into "some" who would rise to life and "some" who would rise to shame—probably assumed a general resurrection of the dead, even though "the many" was tailored to the particular situation the Jewish people would face under the terrible reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.77

The Maccabees evidently believed the hope of 12:2 was for them; we read of seven brothers who remained faithful unto martyrdom when Antiochus IV was imposing suffering and death. The language of these brothers explicitly reflected a hope for resurrection (*2 Macc.* 7:9, 11, 14, 23). The hope of vindication through end-time resurrection would compel the faithfulness of God's people in a period of terrible tribulation. God, not Antiochus IV Epiphanes or even death, would have the last word.

<span id="page-160-5"></span><span id="page-160-2"></span>In reference specifically to the resurrected faithful, Daniel heard that "Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever" (Dan. 12:3). The two parts of the verse are parallel: "those who are wise" are those "who turn many to righteousness," and shining "like the brightness of the sky" is described also as shining "like the stars forever and ever." Both halves speak of the same hope. "Those who are wise" and "who turn many to righteousness" (12:3) are the "wise among the people" in 11:33 who "shall make many understand." God's people would not only remain faithful; they would also exhort others to stay true to Yahweh. The hope held out was not that God's people would actually become stars or angels. The brightness of stars depicts the glory in store for the bodies of God's resurrected people. The reference to "stars" also evokes passages such as Genesis 15:5, where Abraham was told his offspring would be as countless as the stars of the night sky. Jesus used the language of Daniel 12:3 when he declared, "The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father" (Matt. 13:43).

<span id="page-160-13"></span><span id="page-160-12"></span><span id="page-160-9"></span><span id="page-160-7"></span><span id="page-160-0"></span>The promise of resurrection and shining was inaugurated by the Lord Jesus Christ and will be fulfilled at his triumphant return. Paul called Jesus' bodily resurrection the "firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" (1 Cor. 15:20). When Jesus returns, he will "transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself" (Phil. 3:21). Yet even now believers "shine as lights in the world" (Phil. 2:15), probably an allusion to Daniel 12:3 that introduces an already-but-not-yet aspect to our shining like stars. By grace through faith, we have been made alive and raised spiritually and so we shine in that sense (John 5:21, 24; Phil. 2:15), but our bodies will be raised physically as well (2 Cor. 5:1–4), and this raised and glorified existence will be a weight of glory that far exceeds the cost and grief of the "light momentary afflictions" endured in these earthly bodies (2 Cor. 4:17–18).

Adding support to the conclusion that Daniel used the device of recapitulation is the fact that in chapter 8, which also foretold the events surrounding Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the persecution of the Jewish people and the desecration of the temple were framed in an A-B-A'-B' pattern that also utilized recapitulation: see 8:9–10a (A), 8:10b (B), 8:11a (A'), and 8:11b–12 (B'). Being part of a much longer vision, the section of 11:21–12:3 is understandably a much longer piece of prophecy and recapitulation.

<span id="page-161-3"></span>The purpose of the vision and revelation in chapters 10–12 is not to overwhelm the reader with historical detail, although that may happen. The purpose, rather, is for the historical detail to overwhelm the reader with the assurance of God's sovereignty and meticulous guidance of this world. God does not make educated guesses about the future; he decrees it. The detailed engagements of the northsouth kings have led some skeptical scholars to place the dating of the whole book in a Maccabean time period, for these details seem too precise to have been revealed ahead of time. Yet from a faithful perspective, a sixth-century-BC account of these prophecies strengthens our confidence in our God, who reigns over the earth.

Despite how things would appear in those dark days of tribulation, the prophecy confirmed that God was in control. Mighty empires would conquer and subdue <span id="page-162-0"></span>their foes, but the nations are like a drop from a bucket or like dust on the scales (Isa. 40:15). Before God Almighty, the world's rulers and kingdoms are as nothing, so God's people should hold fast and endure, despite generations of trial and opposition. The faithful of those generations would be the "wise" who turned others to righteousness and walked in righteousness themselves—no matter the cost—before tyrannical kings.

<span id="page-162-4"></span><span id="page-162-3"></span><span id="page-162-2"></span><span id="page-162-1"></span>The stories in the earlier parts of the book also encourage readers as they showcase deliverance by God's mighty arm. God's preservation of Daniel and his friends in chapter 1 should compel us to endure even when compromise would be easier. The provision of wisdom to Daniel in chapter 2 should strengthen our confidence that God will grant us what we need to be faithful witnesses amid grim circumstances. The miraculous rescue of chapter 3 should leave us in awe that God is with his people, even in the heat of persecution. The humbling of King Nebuchadnezzar in chapter 4 should remind us that all who are mighty in their own eyes, and in the eyes of the world, are expendable and vulnerable before almighty God, who humbles the proud. The ominous writing on the wall in chapter 5 should sober any who doubt the power and willingness of God to judge the wicked. The remarkable deliverance from death in chapter 6 should stimulate our hope that God will one day vindicate his people by raising them physically from the dead, typified by Daniel's spending a night in a den of lions and living to testify of God's power.

<span id="page-162-10"></span><span id="page-162-9"></span><span id="page-162-8"></span><span id="page-162-7"></span><span id="page-162-6"></span><span id="page-162-5"></span>The visions of the book of Daniel should encourage readers as well, even though alarm at the prophecies of tribulation is reasonable. The scene in chapter 7, of the Son of Man coming in victory to the Ancient of Days, was fulfilled at the ascension and session of Jesus Christ, who defeated death and will return to complete what he inaugurated. In chapter 8, the cunning and malice of the "little horn" was broken and crushed according to God's will and wisdom, a reminder that God brings to pass what he promises. In chapter 9, the hope for a climactic jubilee that would atone for iniquity and establish a strong (and new) covenant was realized in the death of Jesus the Messiah, who led a new and greater exodus from our deepest captivity and exile. And the dark vision of chapter 11, which promised conflict and battle and persecution, nevertheless predicted the light of faithful and wise saints, as many who were wise stood firm against the schemes of Antiochus and rested in the dust at their deaths, awaiting their day of resurrection. The visions of the book strengthen our resolve to follow God faithfully because he is a vindicating God. He uproots and builds, destroys and restores, tears down and raises up.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-163-2"></span><span id="page-163-1"></span><span id="page-163-0"></span>The heavenly figure who appeared to Daniel (10:1–11:1) and gave a word of revelation concerning future tribulation for Israel (11:2–12:3) now instructs Daniel to seal the prophecy (12:4). The events Daniel has heard about will take place in the distant future, beyond his own lifetime. When Daniel asks about the outcome of the events, the figure tells him to go his way (12:8–9). Daniel will rest in death, rise in due time, and receive his inheritance with all the people of God (12:10, 13).

### <span id="page-163-5"></span><span id="page-163-4"></span>*Section Outline*

III.A'.3. Daniel Receives Final Instructions and Encouragement

(12:4–13)

- a. The Heavenly Figure Instructs Daniel (12:4)
	- b. An Angel Asks a Question of the Heavenly Figure (12:5–6)
		- c. The Heavenly Figure Swears an Oath and Speaks of Future Trial (12:7)
- b'. Daniel Asks a Question of the Heavenly Figure (12:8)
- a'. The Heavenly Figure Instructs Daniel (12:9–13)

The last part of the book (12:4–13) involves final instructions and questions in light of what has just been revealed. In keeping with a device used frequently in the book, 12:4–13 is best arranged chiastically. In the opening and closing verses (a and a'), the heavenly figure instructs Daniel. These sections also speak of sealing the book until the time of the end, and in both sections the heavenly figure calls Daniel by name. Sections b and b' contain questions for the heavenly figure: an angel asks how long it will be until the wonders end (b), and Daniel asks what the outcome of the things will be (b'). The center of the chiasm highlights the heavenly figure's oath concerning the future suffering of God's people (c).

<span id="page-164-3"></span><span id="page-164-2"></span><span id="page-164-1"></span>In the three parts of Daniel 10–12 (10:1–11:1; 11:2–12:3; 12:4–13), the first and third parts frame the central prophecy. In each framing section, the heavenly figure is a man clothed in linen (10:5; 12:6–7), the figure calls Daniel by name twice (10:11, 12; 12:4, 9), and a body of water is observed (10:4; 12:5, 7). One further commonality between 10:1–11:1 and 12:4–13 is that in the former the figure raises Daniel from deep sleep on the ground, while in the latter the figure promises Daniel he will share in a future resurrection from the sleep of death in the dust.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-164-0"></span>12:4 Having finished telling Daniel the word of revelation, the heavenly figure gave him a directive: "shut up the words" and "seal the book" (the two statements are synonymous). The reference is probably not merely to the vision and revelation just received in chapters 10–12 but to the whole "book" of stories and disclosures and mysteries (chs. 1–12). Since the time of fulfillment (the appointed "end") of these visions was beyond Daniel's lifetime, the message should be preserved ("sealed") for future readers. The people of God would need the hope of God's Word in their seasons of suffering, and Daniel's visions exalted the sovereign plan and power of God over earthly kingdoms and blasphemous opposition. The readers would need to know of God's certain triumph, which would compel their endurance and goad them in paths of righteousness.

<span id="page-164-5"></span><span id="page-164-4"></span>Though the details of fulfillment were unclear to Daniel at this time, the unfolding of historical events would provide greater understanding for readers of these detailed prophecies and visions (esp. of ch. 11). This promise of increased understanding was probably what the heavenly figure meant by "Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase" (12:4). Though some modern readers might speculate that this promise is foretelling a drastic increase in mobility and in scientific and technological knowledge in the last days, a better meaning is established when we recognize that "running to and fro" in Amos 8:12 was the action of people seeking a word (or revelation) from Yahweh but being unable to find it. Daniel heard the comforting promise that, according to Daniel 12:4, people in the future would seek a word from Yahweh and subsequently grow in understanding because the book had been preserved ("sealed") for them.

<span id="page-165-12"></span><span id="page-165-8"></span>12:5–6 Daniel next reported what he saw and heard. He looked, "and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream." The mention of the "bank of the stream" recalls the beginning of the final vision, in which Daniel was "standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)" (10:4). We have suggested that from 10:5 to 11:1 a single heavenly being appeared to Daniel, spoke to him, restored him physically from debilitating fear, and made known to him the final word of revelation (11:2–12:3). Now "two others" appear, one on each side of the stream, and they are probably angels, although their names are not mentioned. In chapter 8 two angels had been present after a revelation was given (8:13–14), and now again two beings are present (12:5) after a word of revelation.

<span id="page-165-9"></span><span id="page-165-5"></span><span id="page-165-4"></span><span id="page-165-1"></span><span id="page-165-0"></span>Then "someone" spoke, probably one of the angels beside the river. The being spoke "to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream" (12:6). The description matched what Daniel had seen in 10:5 ("behold, a man clothed in linen"), so that heavenly figure was still in view in 12:6. The figure's location "above the waters" implies an exalted divine being. In Genesis 1:2 and Psalm 29:3, e.g., God's Spirit and voice were above the waters, but more important for the scene of Daniel 12:6 is the previous report in 8:16: "I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, 'Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.'" In that scene, the voice was between the banks and thus over the water, directing the angel Gabriel. The "voice between the banks" in 8:16 belonged to a divine figure, so this parallel with 12:7—someone who is about to speak between the banks of a river and thus above the waters—confirms that Daniel encountered a divine figure in 10:5 (the angel of Yahweh), an encounter continuing even in 12:6.

<span id="page-165-14"></span><span id="page-165-6"></span><span id="page-165-3"></span><span id="page-165-2"></span>An angel asked the divine being, "How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?" (12:6). This question further echoed elements in chapter 8, for in 8:13 an angel had asked "how long" the desolation described in the vision of 8:2–12 would last, and the Hebrew word for "wonders" also appeared in both 8:24 and 11:36.78 The angel was probably asking about the time frame of the revelation in 11:21–12:3, a season that had much tumult and tragedy in store for God's people.

<span id="page-165-11"></span><span id="page-165-10"></span>12:7 The "man clothed in linen, who was above the waters," heard the question and was ready to answer. Taking a solemn oath, "He raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished." Note the raising of both hands, which was unique when compared with other solemn oaths (cf.

<span id="page-165-13"></span><span id="page-165-7"></span><sup>78</sup> The word for "wonders" does not occur in the book of Daniel outside of 8:24 ("fearful"); 11:36 ("astonishing things"); and 12:6. Since 11:36 is part of a revelation recapitulating the prophecy about Antiochus IV Epiphanes, 11:36 has the same referent as 8:24 did, for the latter spoke of Antiochus as well. Most certainly, then, 12:6 alludes to the "wonders" that would take place during this specific period of persecution under that specific ruler.

<span id="page-166-1"></span><span id="page-166-0"></span>Deut. 32:40). Since the Lord swears oaths elsewhere in the OT (cf. Gen. 22:14; Ex. 6:8; Ezek. 20:5), the use of an oath in Daniel 12:7 does not disprove the deity of the speaker. Rather, it affirms that he is trustworthy.

<span id="page-166-3"></span><span id="page-166-2"></span>The period of "a time, times, and half a time" recalls 7:25, where it is said that the saints would suffer for a season under the Roman Empire. And, as in 7:25, the phrase is probably approximate rather than strictly literal. "A time, times, and half a time" probably corresponds to roughly three and a half years, which fits well with the period of upheaval and opposition from 167 to 164 BC under the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.79 During those years, the "holy people" of Israel (cf. Deut. 7:6) experienced a "shattering" of their "power" by that tyrannical king. But God promised an "end" to that season of tribulation. The referent of "all these things" (Dan. 12:7) was probably the historical persecution prophesied specifically in 11:21–45 (as Antiochus opposed and massacred Jews, desecrated the temple, and forbade obedience to the law of Moses), because the "wonders" in 12:6 echoed the language of 11:36, which was part of the recapitulation of 11:21–35.

<span id="page-166-12"></span><span id="page-166-8"></span><span id="page-166-7"></span><span id="page-166-6"></span><span id="page-166-4"></span>12:8 Daniel did not understand what he heard, a response identical to his response to the vision of chapter 8 (vv. 15–16, 27), which prophesied the same events as 11:21–45, involving Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Daniel asked, "O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?" (12:8). He wanted to know God's purposes for this period of trial for his people.

<span id="page-166-13"></span>12:9–10 The divine figure clothed in linen replied, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end." Daniel was not to worry about what he did not know, for the vision had been and would be preserved for future readers. For now, Daniel was to move on with his life. No more revelation would be given to him.

Perhaps as a partial answer to Daniel's question, the heavenly figure said, "Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly." One outcome of the persecution, then, would be purification. The heavenly figure contrasted the "many," who were devoted to God, with the "wicked," who were not. The language of being purified and made white and refined probably recalled 11:35, where those three terms also occurred.

<span id="page-166-14"></span><span id="page-166-11"></span>The figure continued the contrast: "None of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand" (12:10). The wicked do not walk wisely or in obedience to God's law. The wise, on the other hand, walk in the fear of Yahweh. They have understanding because of their knowledge of and obedience to God's Word. They trust his providence and believe his promises. The language of the "wise" who "understand" also recalls 11:33, where "the wise among the people shall make many understand," and 11:35, where the "wise" were purified and refined by the trial of persecution. Seeing 12:10 in light of the statements in 11:33–35,

<span id="page-166-10"></span><span id="page-166-9"></span><span id="page-166-5"></span><sup>79</sup> This time period also matches the prediction in 8:14: "For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state." The period from the temple's desecration in 167 BC to its first sacrifice on the newly consecrated altar in 164 was almost 1,150 days (the equivalent of 2,300 evening and morning sacrifices).

<span id="page-167-8"></span>we note the verse is arranged chiastically: the figure spoke about the wise and then the wicked (12:10a) and then, reversing direction, spoke about the wicked and then the wise (12:10b).

<span id="page-167-10"></span><span id="page-167-9"></span><span id="page-167-6"></span><span id="page-167-4"></span>12:11 The angel of Yahweh, still above the waters, made another statement concerning the time of persecution to be endured under Antiochus IV Epiphanes: "From the time that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,290 days." Scholars are not sure what to make of this number, which seems to relate to the events of 11:31–35 (cf. also 8:9–12), but the most compelling answer seems to be one that evokes the length of the Egyptian captivity. The Israelites were captive in Egypt for 430 years (Ex. 12:40–41), and 430 multiplied by 3 is 1,290. The glaring difference is that in Exodus the reference to 430 was to years, while in Daniel it is to days. Nevertheless, the use of 430 could denote a period of captivity. Under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the people of Israel would once again be a people oppressed by a foreign power. But, as in the days of Pharaoh, God would triumph, and his people would be delivered (cf. Dan. 12:1–3). A figurative allusion to Egypt would not be unprecedented, for a literal mention of Egypt was made in 11:8 and 11:42–43. The depiction of Antiochus's reign of terror as captivity may mean we should view him as more vile and oppressive than the pharaoh of Exodus, for his captivity figuratively lasted three times as long.

<span id="page-167-7"></span><span id="page-167-5"></span><span id="page-167-3"></span>12:12 The heavenly speaker pronounced a beatitude, the only one in the book of Daniel addressed to someone other than God: "Blessed is he who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days" (cf. 2:20; 3:28; 4:34). The significance of this number is unclear. The number 1,335 is 45 more than 1,290 (cf. 12:11). It is unclear why the reader would need to wait 45 more days, but the figure may allude to the number of years mentioned by Caleb to Joshua:

I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. . . . And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive, just as he said, these *forty-five* years since the time that the Lord spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. (Josh. 14:7, 10)

<span id="page-167-1"></span>The period of forty-five years was significant for Caleb because it spanned the time he was in the wilderness to the time he received his inheritance after the conquest (cf. Josh. 14:13–15).

<span id="page-167-2"></span><span id="page-167-0"></span>In light of Israel's captivity in Egypt and eventual conquest of the Promised Land, the numbers 1,290 and 1,335 play on that history and hold out hope that the future persecution of the Jews under Antiochus would be only a temporary oppression, followed by conquest and restoration. The people of God, therefore, needed to persevere in full confidence of God's faithfulness and power. Those who persevered would be "blessed" (Dan. 12:12). In Joshua 14, shortly after Caleb's <span id="page-168-3"></span><span id="page-168-1"></span>reference to forty-five years in Joshua 14:10, "Joshua *blessed* him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance" (v. 13).

<span id="page-168-8"></span>12:13 With the divinely revealed assurance that Israel would regain its inheritance after a temporary oppression, Daniel heard one final command and promise: "Go your way till the end. And you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days." Daniel was to live out the rest of his days in faithfulness, "the end" referring to his death. There is no report in the book that Daniel ever returned to Jerusalem, so it is reasonable to assume that he, in his eighties by this point, died in Babylon.

<span id="page-168-7"></span><span id="page-168-6"></span>But Daniel's death outside the Promised Land would not exclude him from inheriting what God had in store for his people. Daniel was told he would "rest" (die) but afterward "shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days." If Daniel rested in death, standing was a promise of resurrection. The good news of resurrection hope (cf. v. 2) applied to him. He would share in resurrection life, shining as the stars forever (v. 3). The language of an "allotted place" was used in Joshua 14–21 as the tribes received portions of the Promised Land (cf. Josh. 15:1; 16:1; 17:1), and thus Daniel was included among those who would inherit all that God promised his people. Allusion to the "allotment" theme in Joshua strengthens the claim that the previous verse (Dan. 12:12) had as background that section of Joshua as well (cf. Josh. 14:10–13).

<span id="page-168-5"></span><span id="page-168-4"></span><span id="page-168-2"></span><span id="page-168-0"></span>The ending of the book of Daniel is especially appropriate in light of its beginning. In the first chapter, Nebuchadnezzar deported Daniel and his friends (in 605 BC) from their home in Judah to the foreign land of Babylon. In the final chapter, even though Daniel still dwelled in the land of Judean exiles, he was promised resurrection and inheritance. He would rest in death but would rise with the saints to everlasting life at the end of days. This book, which reported harrowing tales of threat and deliverance, extolled the God of all nations, who holds in his hand every breath of every creature everywhere. Exiled as a teenager and now an old man purified by trial, Daniel knew firsthand the might and majesty of the world's true Lord. His many visions proved that God's wise timetable was the track of the trains of worldly kingdoms. Rulers rise and fall, nations come and go, but the course of history will unfold to its appointed goal: the display of God's glory in salvation through judgment.80

## *Response*

The contents of the book of Daniel addressed readers during a particularly dark period of Israel's history and prepared them for future tribulation as well, when dark paths would again lie before them. The book intertwines accounts of God's power to judge and to deliver, opening with teenagers going into exile and ending with the promise of the dead coming up from the dust. The book shows us

<sup>80</sup> For a biblical-theological treatment of God's glory being the goal of all he does, see James M. Hamilton Jr., *God's Glory in Salvation through Judgment: A Biblical Theology* (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2010), 37–65, 553–563.

that God keeps his promises, even amid the changing of empires, the succession of kings, and the span of many centuries. We have every reason to look Godward with unwavering confidence. The twelve chapters of this book exalt the Most High God, whose purposes never fail.

The stories and visions in the book of Daniel all declare to the reader: you can trust God. Daniel and his Judean companions serve as examples to those who walk by faith. But their faithfulness, no matter how great and admirable, was a shadow compared to the substance of Jesus' person and work. Jesus was the consummate faithful Israelite, speaking with wisdom and being the very Wisdom and Word of God. Rather than seeking understanding, he spoke with authority and revelation. The furnace of the cross and the den of the tomb were no match for the power of God, for on the third day his death was undone by a glorious resurrection. He was the triumphant stone that rivaled all other kingdoms, and he boldly announced that all authority in heaven and on earth belonged to him (Matt. 28:18). His death sealed the new covenant, which ushered in the jubilee of jubilees, for he—the anointed one—had finished the transgression, put an end to sin, and atoned for iniquity (cf. Dan. 9:24).

<span id="page-169-3"></span><span id="page-169-2"></span><span id="page-169-1"></span>There is none like Jesus, though previous people, institutions, and events prepared his way by serving as types and shadows and signs. He inaugurated God's kingdom and is the firstfruits of resurrection for all who believe. His risen life is a guarantee that all who sleep in the dust of death will also awake, believers rising to everlasting life and the wicked to shame and contempt (Dan. 12:2; John 5:29). We can trust the God of the book of Daniel because Jesus, the "son of man," is now exalted over all things and is subjecting all enemies under his feet (1 Cor. 15:25). Jesus the true and better Adam will establish dominion in the world and overcome every opposition, visible or invisible. He has triumphed over sin, Satan, and every evil principality. He is worthy of our trust, worship, and unwavering allegiance.

# HOSEA

*George M. Schwab Sr.*

## INTRODUCTION TO HOSEA

### *Overview*

"The Book of Hosea is the most scandalous book of the Bible." When I say this to Christians, they nod knowingly, readily accepting the premise. I suppose they are thinking of the escapades of Gomer, the prophet's nymphomaniac wife. But that is not what I mean at all. Instead I am referring to the book's theology. The precarious marriage of Hosea and Gomer is used to picture the broken covenant between Yahweh and Israel. The scandal is in the unbelievable lengths to which the metaphor is pushed. Like a jealous husband, Yahweh is portrayed as having conflicted thoughts. He wants to punish Israel, but he also tenderly wants to take her back.

There is much more to Hosea than that, however. If one wants to read an OT book that shows the heart of God, this is the book. His people care nothing for him. If they believed their prosperity came from him, they would not mistreat their fellow Israelites to advance themselves. They would not enter into foreign treaties in order to feel secure. They would not foolishly bow down to wretched homemade gods to thank them for what their covenant Lord has given. What must Yahweh do to get their attention? What will it take to make things right? These are issues the book of Hosea explores. In doing so, it puts the passionate heart of God on clear display.

### <span id="page-173-0"></span>*Title and Author*

The book bears the name of the prophet Hosea, son of Beeri, to whom Yahweh imparted his urgent message at a critical time—during the last generation of the northern kingdom of Israel, before final judgment fell. The word of the prophet held out to them their last chance for salvation. In addition to being given prophetic oracles, Hosea was also called to image God—to reflect in his own person the distress and grief and exasperation that Israel's God felt toward Israel.

<span id="page-173-2"></span><span id="page-173-1"></span>While the book makes clear that its main message was given to Hosea (1:1), it does not identify who wrote it down in its final form. Because chapter 3 is written in the first person, it seems plausible to suggest that Hosea himself wrote it, though this is the only chapter of the book in which he speaks in the first person. As far as who recorded the rest of the book, suggestions range from Hosea himself to disciples who copied down his messages.

Another question concerns how many of these oracles Hosea actually publicly preached. We are not told where or when these messages were proclaimed publicly, making it hard to know if they were. It is thus possible that this literary work was always just that—a written (rather than spoken) appeal. (It is convenient, however, to refer to Hosea as "preaching" his sermons.) It seems plausible to suggest that his messages were carried in written form to the southern kingdom of Judah, where they were cherished alongside other inspired works. The book's divine character was recognized there, and it was eventually incorporated into the prophetic collection of the Bible.

## *Date and Occasion*

According to the title, Hosea's ministry of receiving and conveying the word of God took place from the reign of King Uzziah to the reign of King Hezekiah in Judah, and during the reign of King Jeroboam II in Israel—roughly from before 753 to after 728 BC. During that time Israel transitioned from peaceable prosperity to the verge of unrecoverable ruin. Israel's capital city, Samaria, was destroyed in 722 BC, just a few years after Hosea issued his last warnings. Hosea saw the day of reckoning looming closer and closer and sought to warn the people to escape their doom, but instead they spurned the word of God and swaggered along their obstinate ways toward inevitable destruction and death. As dreadful as this was for Hosea to endure, it was even more painful for God.

## *Setting and Audience*

The book of Hosea deals almost entirely with the northern tribes of Israel. This is its first audience. If the book had remained the sole possession of the north, however, it would have perished with Samaria. At some point, faithful scribes must have brought it south to Judah, perhaps as they fled the coming judgment. His warnings then served as a template for how Judah should have comported herself in relation to her God. Indeed, Judah is mentioned ten times in the book.

In the end, Judah also perished as a nation. But unlike in Israel, a remnant of Judah survived to continue as God's people. This tiny community owned and internalized the prophecy of Hosea. The word of God did not fall to the ground but found a place with a new generation of faithful worshipers. They eventually grouped Hosea with eleven other shorter books of prophecy into a single collection, which today is called the Minor Prophets.

## *Theology of Hosea; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

## THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITHFULNESS TO THE COVENANT

<span id="page-174-0"></span>In the book of Exodus, the Lord enters into covenant relationship with the nation of Israel (Exodus 20–24). Generally speaking, "the word 'covenant' (*berit*) refers to God's relationship with another entity that is initiated by God and established by his solemn word (promise or oath)."1 God's covenant with Israel was to be much

<sup>1</sup> J. Andrew Dearman, *The Book of Hosea*, NICOT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2010), 51.

more personal than a contract and much more permanent than an ordinary relationship.2

In light of this covenant relationship, the primary task of a prophet in the OT was not to predict the future but to enforce this covenant among the Lord's people. Prophets "considered themselves spokespersons for Yahweh, who through them called his people *back* to obedience to the covenant he had given them many centuries before, and reminded them of its curses and blessings, which Yahweh had sworn to honor."3

Like the other prophets, Hosea frequently reminds the people of these covenant curses and blessings as he calls the nation to turn from other gods and to the Lord. In terms of blessing, in several passages Hosea speaks of future bliss, a day in which the Lord's people will be restored in their relationship to him and enjoy peace and prosperity in their land, under his loving and watchful eye (Hos. 1:10–2:1; 2:14–23; 3:5; 6:1–3; etc.).

<span id="page-175-1"></span><span id="page-175-0"></span>However, the immediate focus of the book of Hosea is on the coming curses (2:9–13; 4:1–6; 5:1–7; etc.). And unlike blessings, which seem to be coming at a time in the distant future, the curses are spoken of as being just around the corner. The reason is not hard to see: by worshiping other gods, Israel has been so unfaithful to the covenant that the punishments for covenant disobedience are about to break out against them.

As Israel's history continues, the covenant curses do come to fruition, seen most graphically in the covenant curse of exile that fell on Hosea's audience—the northern kingdom of Israel—in 722 BC. Those who abandon covenant faithfulness can expect covenant curse.

<span id="page-175-3"></span>The NT bears similar warnings for the people of God. The book of Hebrews looks back to examples of faithlessness in the history of the nation of Israel and the terrible curses that came as a result, exhorting those who claim to be Christians not to imitate Israel's example, lest they too suffer God's judgment (Heb. 3:1–4:13). God is fully aware when faith is not real. Hebrews is particularly adamant that turning away from Jesus is the supreme act of faithlessness and will be met with a fearful response: "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? . . . It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:28–29, 31). Hosea's call to repentance and covenant faithfulness is thus not simply for a bygone era; it is a message that rings with equal importance today.

#### <span id="page-175-4"></span>THE LORD'S PEOPLE AS HIS "HOUSEHOLD"

<span id="page-175-2"></span>In Hosea, the Lord's relationship to Israel is sometimes compared to that of a husband and wife (chs. 1–3, esp. 2:16, 19–20); at other times, it is compared to

<sup>2</sup> Cf. Timothy Keller, *Preaching: Communicating Faith in an Age of Skepticism* (New York: Viking, 2015), 104.

<sup>3</sup> Douglas Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, WBC (Waco, TX: Word, 1987), xxxii.

<span id="page-176-0"></span>that of a parent and child (1:10; 11:1, 3–4, 10). Both of these metaphors come from the realm of the household.4 In the ancient world, the household was the basic building block of society, and faithfulness to the relationships within the household was of fundamental importance. Thus Hosea's household metaphors would have been particularly powerful ways to underscore Israel's treachery. But Hosea does not use these metaphors only to convict; he uses them to encourage as well, especially as he speaks of the Lord's commitment of love and faithfulness toward the members of *his* household.

<span id="page-176-4"></span>What must not be missed is that the Lord is the one who takes the initiative with his wayward children. He is the one who is faithful, even amid their unfaithfulness. He continues to show himself to be the God of mercy, compassion, and love. He shows this above all in sending Jesus, the one through whom he reconciles his creation to himself. It is in Jesus that we now experience adoption as children of God (Eph. 1:5); it is in relationship to Jesus that we are made a bride washed clean, as he is the groom who lays down his life that we might be saved (Eph. 5:23, 25–27). It is in Jesus that God restores mankind to his household, returning prodigal sons and daughters to the loving embrace of their father.

#### <span id="page-176-5"></span>GOD LOVES HIS PEOPLE BUT MUST PUNISH EVIL

<span id="page-176-1"></span>In keeping with the metaphor of the household, the picture of the Lord that emerges in Hosea is of a God who loves his people as a husband loves his wife, or as a parent loves his child, but who also must punish their evil. Seeing his people's faithlessness, he laments, "What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah?" (Hos. 6:4). This is the cry of a conflicted parent who loves his faithless child and yet, because of that love, must bring discipline to bear. The thought is repeated in 11:8: "How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? . . . My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender."

<span id="page-176-2"></span>How does the Lord reconcile this deep love for his people with the need to bring justice to bear for the evil they have done? These two passions of God that stand out so clearly in Hosea find their ultimate resolution at the cross of Jesus Christ. There the just punishment for sin and the deep love of God meet: "God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:8). The book of Hosea thus yearns for the cross and seeks Jesus to fulfill it.

#### <span id="page-176-3"></span>*Preaching from Hosea*

Throughout this commentary, the Response sections provide ideas and suggestions for how Hosea's various passages apply to today's church. There is one aspect of the book, however, of which it may be helpful to speak more broadly: its use of imagery.

The book of Hosea is rich in its use of images. Sometimes the prophet uses similes, comparing one object to another using the word "like" or "as": "What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a

<sup>4</sup> Dearman, *Hosea*, 44; cf. his fuller discussion on 44–50.

<span id="page-177-2"></span><span id="page-177-1"></span>morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away" (Hos. 6:4). Or again, "Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria" (7:11). At other times the prophet uses metaphors, comparing one object to another without using "like" or "as." In Hosea, God is a husband who expects fidelity from his spouse (2:16). He is a lion who will easily kill and leave his prey for dead (5:14). He is a nurturing parent, taking Ephraim tenderly in his arms (11:3).

<span id="page-177-4"></span><span id="page-177-0"></span>Images are used for various reasons. First, they allow a great deal of information to be conveyed using few words. Comparing God to a parent can be done in a few words, and yet this comparison teaches a great deal concerning who God is and how we are to relate to him. Second, images communicate powerfully. By using objects and events from our everyday lives, images resonate deeply with our hearts and minds. Third, images help us to understand what is otherwise incomprehensible. God is the great unknowable Being, infinite in his nature and person. He thus often uses images—taken from our finite world—to help us understand what he is like.

<span id="page-177-3"></span>In preaching passages that make use of images, there are two dangers to be avoided. The first is to sanitize an image, to blunt its force, because it sometimes feels too raw. For example, in Hosea 11 the Lord compares himself to a parent who is conflicted about the evil behavior of his child, Israel. On the one hand, he knows they deserve severe discipline. At the same time, he loves them, and this pains his heart: "How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? . . . My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender" (11:8). Such emotion and passion does not always fit into the categories we use to describe God, but we must not bend the image to fit our categories; we must bend our categories to fit the image. In this case, because of the extent of God's love for his people, he feels like a conflicted parent who knows punishment is due and yet seeks to show mercy instead. This is the God Hosea is describing.

<span id="page-177-5"></span>The second danger to avoid is to read too much into an image. When an image is used to compare one object to another, there is usually a very limited point of comparison, and the text itself typically makes the comparison clear. In Hosea 11 God is a parent to Israel and, like a parent, is conflicted when he must punish his child; this is the point of the comparison, as the text itself emphasizes. But there are other things that are true about parents that are not true of God: they can be short-tempered or unjust, they have a partner with whom they birthed the child, they need their sleep if they are going to parent well, and so forth. All of these things are true when it comes to parents, but none should be mentioned when speaking of God as a parent in Hosea 11.

In short, there are three questions that are important to ask of any image: What is the person/thing/event being compared? What person/thing/event is it being compared to? What point of similarity is being made? It is the last question that is especially important to answer, and this will require close attention to the image's context. But when we answer these questions well, we have the key to unlocking the image and making its meaning clear.

## *Outline*

Hosea is not easy to outline. There are many ways to do so, and no two scholars handle it exactly alike. Several times the word "case" (Hb. *rib*) is found, referring to a legal controversy, plea, or indictment.

## HOSEA 1:1

<span id="page-180-0"></span>1 The word of the Lord that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.

#### *Section Outline*

I. Title: Uzziah–Hezekiah, Jeroboam II (1:1)

#### *Comment*

1:1 Although Hosea was a prophet to the northern tribes, curiously this title lists only one king from the north but four from the south. Other northern kings of Hosea's time included Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, and Pekah. These were generally short-lived administrations in which the usual mode of advancement was assassination. To omit them from the title seems enigmatic, as if the tacit message of the editor is that these unnamed kings were illegitimate and that before Samaria actually fell, the story of God's people had already passed exclusively to Judah. Note the comments in the Introduction on Date and Occasion.

<span id="page-180-1"></span>In a similar way, God later removed idolatrous kings and corrupt prophets from Jerusalem and replaced them after the exile with a new set of leaders—such as Ezra and Nehemiah—who were committed to the covenant of Moses. Later still, Jesus told his disciples that they would replace the current spiritual leaders of the Jews. In the kingdom, they and not the Sanhedrin would rule (Matt. 19:28). Of course, on the day of Pentecost the Spirit came upon Jesus' disciples, and the NT church was founded on the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20). The religious leadership of that generation of Israel had no role in God's kingdom without the Spirit of Jesus to transform them.

<span id="page-180-2"></span>The true King of Israel is the one who always keeps covenant and was faithful in all things unto death: Jesus. The history of these kings of Israel and Judah, and their leaving-much-to-be-desired leadership, presses forward to and yearns for Jesus—the Word of God sent to a sinful people.

#### *Section Overview*

This chapter introduces a metaphor that is foundational to the book of Hosea and serves as the Minor Prophets' introduction to the relationship between God and Israel. The prophet is called to image Yahweh by marrying a woman who will break his heart. Not only does he marry a sexually deviant woman, but his children, whose paternity is disputed, are eventually disavowed—just as the Lord here threatens to do with Israel.

But just as Yahweh reaches the peak of his repudiation, claiming to have run out of patience with the northern kingdom, refusing to save them, and disinheriting them, he performs a turnaround practically in midsentence, promising to take them back and bless them.

This opening of the book reveals the conflicted heart of God. He is portrayed exactly like a betrayed husband. He wants to punish his unfaithful wife—but he still loves her and desires to take her back. Something about the feelings of a betrayed husband communicates Yahweh's disposition toward Israel.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-182-0"></span>1:2–3 Yahweh commands Hosea to marry a "wife of whoredom [*zenunim*]." This Hebrew term indicates illicit sexual behavior. Moses uses the word in Genesis 38:24 to refer to Tamar's posing as a shrine prostitute in order to entice Judah. Hosea's wife, Gomer, bears this label, not necessarily because she is a prostitute but because she is (or will become) a woman characterized by sexual infidelity.

<span id="page-182-4"></span>The ESV translates the last phrase of Hosea 1:2, "for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the Lord." The Hebrew idiom woodenly reads, "for the land commits great whoredom from after the Lord." This is the first of a series of expressions in Hosea where God puts himself in the place of a forsaken human lover (cf. comment on 2:2–5 [esp. v. 5]). Hosea does as Yahweh instructed and marries Gomer, who then bears him a son (1:3).

<span id="page-182-8"></span><span id="page-182-6"></span><span id="page-182-1"></span>1:4–5 Hosea's firstborn is named "Jezreel." This name is revealed to be a prophetic judgment: the "blood of Jezreel" will be visited upon the house of Jehu, and the power of Israel will be broken. "Blood of Jezreel" refers to the violent acts that took place there. In order to acquire Naboth's vineyard in Jezreel, Jezebel orchestrated his murder. Because of this, Elijah pronounced a terrible judgment against her and her husband, Ahab (1 Kings 21:17–24). Jehu struck down their heir, King Joram, and disposed of his body on Naboth's land in Jezreel. He then killed another descendant of Ahab—King Ahaziah of Judah. At Jezreel, Jezebel was thrown out of a window, her blood spattering against the wall on her way down, and she was trampled by horses (2 Kings 9:30–37). Finally, all seventy sons of Ahab were killed and their heads piled up at the entrance of the Jezreel gate (2 Kings 10:1–11). This is the "blood of Jezreel."

<span id="page-182-3"></span><span id="page-182-2"></span>There is some debate concerning the phrase "I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel." The Hebrew wording for this phrase is "I will visit the <span id="page-183-0"></span>blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu," which may be understood in two different ways. The word for "blood" can refer to "bloodguilt" (Lev. 20:9), so that the sense would be that the Lord will punish the house of Jehu on account of all the blood they shed at Jezreel. This does create some tension, however, since the Lord elsewhere says to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel" (2 Kings 10:30). In other words, this approach would mean that what is praised in 2 Kings is condemned here.

<span id="page-183-3"></span><span id="page-183-2"></span>One possible explanation of the tension argues that Hosea is addressing a different element of the massacre than does 2 Kings 10. In 2 Kings, the emphasis is on Jehu's going to war against Baal, thereby cleansing the land from his horrible influence. This is commendable. But God did not sanction the bloodthirstiness of how this was accomplished, and in Hosea, the emphasis is on the way in which this violence was an offense against the Lord.

<span id="page-183-1"></span>A second approach, which avoids this tension, is simply to say that the prophecy against the house of Jehu (specifically, King Zechariah) is not a punishment for the carnage perpetuated by Jehu at all. The word for "blood" can refer not only to "bloodguilt" (Lev. 20:9) but also to "bloodshed" (1 Kings 2:5), so that the sense of the verse would be, "I will visit the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu": Jehu's wicked house will meet the same kind of violent end that it inflicted on Ahab's house at Jezreel.

<span id="page-183-5"></span>In either case, Hosea 1:5 makes clear that God will bring an end to the northern kingdom. He will break their "bow"—their military power. He will be toyed with no longer. The Valley of Jezreel, where the dynasty of Jeroboam got its start, will be emblematic of its violent end.6

<span id="page-183-6"></span>1:6–7 Gomer next gave birth to a girl, whom Yahweh named "No Mercy" (*Lo-ruhama*). Gone are the days of forgiveness and mercy to Israel. The tenderness one would expect of a parent toward a child is now gone. This kind of mercy, says Yahweh, will no longer characterize his treatment of Israel.

<span id="page-183-7"></span>The southern tribe of Judah, however, will continue to enjoy God's favor (v. 7). He will save them "by the Lord their God," not through military means. Soon after Hosea's ministry, the Assyrian army did destroy Samaria. But when they came up against King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, they were soundly defeated without an arrow being shot (2 Kings 17–19). The promise came true: for Israel there was no compassion, but for Judah there was supernatural salvation.

<span id="page-183-8"></span><span id="page-183-4"></span>1:8–9 Again Gomer gave birth, and this time her baby son was named "Not My People" (*Lo-ammi* ). The reason for this name is explained in a sort of negative covenant formula. Instead of the usual "I will be their God and they will be my people," the Lord declares, "You are not my people, and I am not your God." The

<sup>6</sup> Thomas McComiskey calls this the "ultimate irony" (*Minor Prophets* [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1992], 1:21).

Hebrew can also be read, "I am not I am for you."7 Thus the divine covenantal name for God is no longer appropriate for Israel to use. He is not theirs; his ever-present reality, his "I am–ness," is now inaccessible to them.

<span id="page-184-3"></span>1:10–11 At this point, an oracle breaks out that asserts the exact opposite of what has just been said.8 The reversals are striking. Instead of disowning Israel, as he has just done, God now blesses them with the promise of great numbers, like the immeasurable sand of the seashore. Those who had just been declared "not my people" are now named "Children of the living God." While Israel and Judah had been sharply distinguished just three verses earlier, now together they will unite under one head, perhaps a future Davidic king (v. 11). Thus this oracle overrides the earlier point made by the naming of Hosea's children. Everything said against them is taken back. And this joyous day will happen where else but in Jezreel, which means "God sows"! Israel will once again be a bountiful harvest (cf. 2:23).

<span id="page-184-6"></span><span id="page-184-5"></span><span id="page-184-4"></span>2:1 Therefore it follows that they will be called "You are my people" and "You have received mercy." After being alienated from Yahweh, they will be restored. In this promise of restoration, God's own heart is on display. He desires to withhold forgiveness and mercy because of their infidelity—but he also seeks to provide these graces. He wants to punish Israel, but also to take her back.

### *Response*

This first chapter of Hosea—featuring children given awful names in order to make theological points—starts with judgment and ends with grace. The phrases "I am your God," "you are my people," or some form of these are found many times in Hosea (1:9; 2:23; 3:5; 4:12; 13:4; etc.). This is relational language that echoes the relationship between both husband and wife and father and son.9

<span id="page-184-2"></span>In chapter 1, God threatens to divorce/disown Israel but also envisions a future forgiveness and restoration. This future is connected with taking on a new "head"—presumably of Davidic lineage. It is not hard for a Christian to see in this a prophecy of Jesus, who personally fulfills the prophecy on behalf of Israel. Jesus on the cross suffered the ultimate punishment on behalf of his people, showing that even the exile of Judah and their subsequent restoration did not suffice to atone for their sins. Often prophecies such as this, which originally addressed the nation, are appropriated and adopted by the nation's anointed King, the Messiah, who accomplished redemption for them. Another example would be Daniel 7, where Jesus ("one like a son of man"; Dan. 7:13) individually endures what all the saints corporately are said to face.

<span id="page-184-1"></span><span id="page-184-0"></span>To Paul, the meaning of this prophecy is a matter of election. God can choose to elect even undeserving Gentiles. In the light of Pentecost and the subsequent

<sup>8</sup> James Nogalski labels this "YHWH changes YHWH's Mind" (James Nogalski, *The Book of the Twelve: Hosea– Jonah* [Macon, GA: Smyth & Helwys, 2011], 43). The contrast with the preceding verse is so strong that in Hebrew the chapter break occurs here.

<span id="page-185-0"></span>unfolding of the history of the church, in which God sent his Spirit into the hearts of non-Jews, a whole new vista of meaning opened up for Paul. Those of whom it was said "not my people" are now declared to be "Children of the living God" (cf. Hos. 1:10; Rom. 9:22–26). This refers to Gentiles. Paul sees in this a prophecy of the Gentiles' coming to faith through Jesus. God surprisingly elects some for salvation who were previously enemies of God.

<span id="page-185-8"></span><span id="page-185-2"></span>What then should be the Christian's response to this? One lesson that can be drawn is that Christians should live faithfully as God's people. God broke off dead branches to make room for the Gentile church. Only by continuing in his kindness will a believer continue to enjoy the great fruits and blessings of this salvation. So we must seek humility, put off pride, and revere this God who brooks no rivals for our hearts (Rom. 11:17–24).

## OVERVIEW OF HOSEA 2:2–3:5

<span id="page-185-1"></span>After the introductory chapter 1, this first major section begins with a repeated call to "plead" with God's ex-wife, Israel (2:2–5). The Hebrew word for "plead" is *rib* and often indicates strife or contention in a legal sense. Chapter 2 thus begins with an oracle detailing the exact complaint the Lord has against Israel and what he will do about it.10

<span id="page-185-4"></span><span id="page-185-3"></span>But it moves on from there, envisioning a time in which God will tenderly take Israel back after punishing her (2:6–23). Again, the conflicted passions of God are vibrantly expressed: the urges to punish her (2:6–15) and to win her back (2:16–23).

<span id="page-185-6"></span><span id="page-185-5"></span>In the final section of this passage (3:1–5), the prophet's own life becomes an object lesson one last time to illustrate spiritual realities. He covenants once more with a woman who seems pathologically incapable of good behavior. This reflects the extremity of God's commitment to Israel. Apparently this woman had suffered consequences for her poor choices and actions, but Hosea, at great cost to himself, redeems her.

<span id="page-185-7"></span><sup>10</sup> The same word (*rib*) occurs at the beginning of other major sections; cf. 4:1 and 12:2.

## HOSEA 2:2–5

- **<sup>2</sup>** "Plead with your mother, plead for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband that she put away her whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts;
- **<sup>3</sup>** lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and make her like a parched land, and kill her with thirst.
- **<sup>4</sup>** Upon her children also I will have no mercy, because they are children of whoredom.
- **<sup>5</sup>** For their mother has played the whore; she who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.' "

## *Section Overview*

In this oracle, God vents his epic fury against his cheating spouse. He vividly goes over the details in his mind, rehearsing what he will do to her unless (until?) she shows remorse. He will strip her of all her gifts. He will publicly shame her. He will make her like a barren desert and kill her with thirst. He is a very jealous husband, justifiably full of hot and ardent wrath, having been cheated on and taken for granted and scorned for the last time. It is unconscionable that she has actually credited his rivals for the things he gave her. He has had it with her! Her penalty is destruction, and he relishes the thought of executing her sentence. Historically this did happen to Israel (2 Kings 18:9–12), and, as predicted, there was none to save her (Hos. 2:10).

- III. The Case of the Jilted Husband (2:2–3:5)
	- A. Plead with Your Mother (2:2–5)

## *Comment*

<span id="page-186-1"></span>2:2–5 The first major section begins with the adjuration to "Plead." This is meant in a legal sense, as in pleading a case in court. The command is naturally understood as being directed to the Israelites—or, at the least, to any faithful Israelites who remain. The one they are to bring charges against is their "mother," which many commentators agree is also a reference to Israel.11 Thus "Plead with your mother, plead" is a call for the faithful in the land (if there are any) to plead with the rest of the people. In this regard, it may be read as a call for all faithful believers, in whatever age, to join with the prophet in condemning all who hypocritically or ignorantly perpetrate ungodly and unethical behaviors in the name of God.

God repudiates Israel; no longer can she claim to be his "wife." Once more she (Samaria and therefore all Israel) is called to "put away" or "turn aside" from her deviant sexual behavior: fornication and "adultery" from "between her breasts" (v. 2), a quite explicit sexual image. This imagery continues into verse 3, where the threat is that she will be stripped naked and exposed as on the day she was born.

The next image has nothing to do with the female body. She will be abandoned like a desert, parched and barren. Note that Yahweh intends to kill her, horribly and painfully. This is a death sentence—assuming the people will not turn back to him. Death by neglect, death by drought, death by exposure, death by slow dehydration in the desert.

<span id="page-187-3"></span><span id="page-187-2"></span><span id="page-187-1"></span><span id="page-187-0"></span>Repeating the message of 1:8, God declares that he will not show compassion on the children of spiritual adultery (2:4). Samaria and all Israel shamefully and profligately pursue lovers other than their God (v. 5). Yahweh's first accusation was that Israel did not pursue him, they whored "from after" him (1:2 AT). Now, this language is employed to designate whom she did "go after": many other lovers. What truly outrages Yahweh is that Israel credits these lovers—who are unnamed here but who later we learn include Baal (2:8)—with all of the good things that he has given her. This simply cannot stand. God's honor demands the ultimate sanction. By the time God is finished, no one will be able to claim that Baal has ever benefited Israel.

#### <span id="page-187-4"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-187-8"></span><span id="page-187-7"></span><span id="page-187-5"></span>The rage of God against betrayal is vividly portrayed in this section. The NT goes even further concerning this aspect of God: the whole unbelieving world awaits a lake of fire and final judgment (Rev. 20:15). But the NT also shows the unbelievably excessive grace and love of the Father in that the King of Israel took responsibility for his people and willingly assumed their debt (Col. 2:14). He even took upon himself their thirst (John 19:28). Thus this terrible penalty is paid for all who are his. It is therefore vitally important for sinners to identify with Jesus instead of with any other savior or pretender such as Baal, if they are to avoid the just punishment their sins deserve (Acts 4:12).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-189-1"></span>2:6–8 This pericope (unit of text) captures an entirely different mood of Israel's covenant partner. Gone is the language of hostility and punishment. His emotions suddenly turn toward a strategy of "tough love" in order to win her back. It is as if the previous paragraph — seething with enmity and reveling in comeuppance — has been forgotten. Now the goal is to restore the relationship. The sudden shifts in mood match the sudden shifts in feeling a husband might experience toward a faithless wife. This conveys something true about God's attitude toward Israel. He is not portrayed as cool and calculating; his emotions are deeply involved.

<span id="page-189-0"></span>God plans to restrict Israel's freedom uncomfortably. She will experience a decreasing array of choices until her ability to connect with Yahweh's rivals is beyond her reach (vv. 6–7). Think of Israel as a donkey, hemmed in by walls and thorns so as to be unable to follow its natural instincts. In the same way, God will economically, politically, and militarily render the northern kingdom powerless to derive benefit from gods or political alliances.

<span id="page-189-3"></span>Her addiction to other gods will not save her, nor will the nations help. She has not acknowledged that good things come from God—land and water as well as grain, wine, oil, wool, and flax (vv. 8–9). Yahweh has also provided silver and gold, which she has put to the service of Baal (v. 8). Such is the profundity of her ignorance.

<span id="page-189-4"></span><span id="page-189-2"></span>But she will realize that she was better off with her "first husband" and will return to him (v. 7). This is the first of twenty-three times that the word "return" (Hb. *shub*) occurs in Hosea (e.g., 3:5; 5:4; 6:1). It often connotes repentance, a turning of heart and mind back to Yahweh.

<span id="page-190-4"></span><span id="page-190-3"></span>2:9–13 Like the previous unit, this one also begins with "therefore." Here, God details his plan to hedge Israel in and cause her to return (cf. vv. 6–7). Through a painful process she will be separated from her gods. She will seek them but not find them. She will lose the benefits for which she trusted them. Only after she gives up on their provision will she consider returning to Yahweh.

<span id="page-190-0"></span>The text of verse 9 reads literally, "Therefore I will turn [*shub*] and I will take back . . ." Here is an example of God's turning from one stated intention to another (cf. 1:8–11; 5:14–6:2; 11:9; 14:4). He will systematically take from Israel all of the good things that had beguiled her. If her grain and wine cannot be separated from Baal, then the grain and wine will have to go. By taking away (Hb. "rescuing") Israel's wool and flax, her folly will be exposed. Naked she will stand, with no reason or evidence that her faith in Baal was justified (v. 10). He will "rescue" goods from her grasp (v. 9), but no one will "rescue" her from *his* grasp (v. 10). Her "lovers" will stand silently by as spectators, unable to act, as Yahweh exposes her shame. Such will be the extent of the rough intervention she needs.

<span id="page-190-6"></span><span id="page-190-5"></span>In addition, God declares, "I will put an end to all her mirth" (v. 11). The Hebrew phrase is, woodenly, "I will turn all her mirth"—the word *shub* again. An idolatrous thread is woven throughout the fabric of Israelite society. Something of Baal and the fertility cult touches every religious event—even those done in the name of Yahweh. Thus, it all has to go. Israel must be separated with finality from this terrible addiction. She must no longer think of her lovers. The benefits she believed came from her gods must be removed. Yahweh has to amputate in order to save the patient.

<span id="page-190-7"></span>God will (woodenly glossed) "visit the days of the Baals upon her" (v. 13), meaning the guilt accumulated by her false worship will be punished. Indeed, her faithlessness is metaphorically described as dressing up, putting on jewelry, and going after other lovers while forgetting the Lord. God desires her to love and pursue him exclusively (v. 13). The harsh measures are necessary if he is to "turn" this difficult people back to himself.

<span id="page-190-8"></span><span id="page-190-2"></span>2:14–15 This passage also begins with "therefore" (cf. 2:6, 9). God will allure Israel once more. He will "speak tenderly to her" (lit., "speak to her heart"). It will be as when he redeemed Israel from bondage in Egypt, brought her to the wilderness, and covenanted with her.

<span id="page-190-9"></span>The Valley of Achor (v. 15) is important in Joshua 7. Israel had been defeated due to one man's disobedience. Once the sin was punished—requiring the man's death with his family at the Valley of Achor—Israel went on to victory. Hosea 2:15 references this event and reveals that the site will become something different, an entryway into a positive future. This is parallel to how Jezreel, a place of judgment, became a symbol of future blessing as well (1:11).

<span id="page-190-1"></span>On that day, Israel will "answer"—respond—like the generation redeemed from Egypt. At Sinai, Yahweh covenanted with them. The future relationship between God and Israel will be like that all over again. She will love him back. She will have eyes only for him.

<span id="page-191-4"></span><span id="page-191-2"></span>Take note that this passage is as much an emotional reaction to being betrayed as was the earlier one in which the Lord expressed his righteous desire to execute his people (2:3). There, he would make her like a parched desert. The "wilderness" was a curse. Here, he has reversed that curse and transformed the wilderness into a blessing. He loves Israel very much. He imagines she will feel the same eventually. It will be like the good old days, early in the relationship, when they were young lovers. Perhaps this is why even a harsh section like 2:7–9 is couched in language reminiscent of the Song of Solomon (Song 3:1–4; 5:2–7). Perhaps this is also why the wilderness wanderings seem to be remembered through rose-colored glasses. Although the wilderness experience was often a period of frustration and anger for Yahweh, requiring at times its own brand of tough love, his own tenderness for his people causes him to focus on the positive aspects even of those difficult times.

## <span id="page-191-1"></span>*Response*

The Baal cult was concerned with fertility and prosperity, not with living righteously. This raises the possibility that idolatry and a worldly mind-set could infiltrate the hearts and minds of modern-day Christians as well. Is the church today distracted from the gospel mission by worldly considerations? What false gods or alternate sources of blessing do Christians trust in today, for security or a sense of well-being? Must the Father today bring back a wayward people through harsh measures, such as by removing material prosperity that is so seductive?

<span id="page-191-5"></span><span id="page-191-0"></span>The Lord does still operate this way. Paul argues that sicknesses and even several deaths in the Corinthian church were directly attributable to a corruption of their worship and thinking: "When we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world" (1 Cor. 11:32). Hebrews 12 teaches that this is a constant spiritual principle of how God admonishes his people. Quoting Proverbs 3:11–12, Hebrews argues that God disciplines his children in order to make them fit for his service (Heb. 12:3–11). How, then, must God chastise us? What in our lives must be removed in order for us to live a life worthy of our calling? It is on this that every Christian must meditate. If we fail to live under God's discipline, he will defend his honor with harsh measures. He must.

<span id="page-191-6"></span><span id="page-191-3"></span>But the story does not end there. Note the shift from Hosea 2:6–13 to what follows in verses 14–15: judgment is replaced with mercy. The Bible is the story of a God who brings justice to bear against sin and yet loves and has mercy on sinners. There is no greater demonstration of this than what transpired at the cross. Because Jesus stood in the place of those who had earned judgment, God's just wrath was fully satisfied, and he could for Jesus' sake accept and sanctify the people he loves. The heart of God on display in Hosea is thus seen with even greater clarity in the gift of his Son.

## HOSEA 2:16–23

<span id="page-192-1"></span>**<sup>16</sup>** "And in that day, declares the Lord, you will call me 'My Husband,' and no longer will you call me 'My Baal.' **17**For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more. **18**And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-192-2"></span>The phrase "in that day" recalls the prophetic theme of the "day of the Lord," an especially common theme in the Minor Prophets. Each prophet views it from a slightly different angle. To Joel, the "day of the Lord" is a terrible day, akin to a locust plague, a day of darkness and judgment, yet whoever calls on Yahweh will be saved (Joel 2:30–32). To Amos, it is a day that Israelites (Hosea's contemporaries) should dread, not desire (Amos 5:18–20), as it will involve terrible climactic judgment. Similarly, Malachi asks, "Who can endure the day of his coming?" (Mal. 3:2), implying that it is a day to be dreaded. Zephaniah foresees a day so severe that nothing will survive (Zeph. 1:2–18).

<span id="page-192-5"></span><span id="page-192-4"></span><span id="page-192-3"></span>In this chapter of Hosea, however, the focus is on positive aspects of that day. We read of a future time of wedded bliss between Israel and the Lord. A renewed marriage contract is envisioned that will last forever.

<span id="page-192-0"></span>Two levels of meaning can be discerned in Hosea 2:16ff. On the one hand, the passage addresses historical Israel, the people who abandoned Yahweh in order to worship Baal. They are promised restoration as a religious-political entity on their

traditional plot of land, which was fulfilled when Judah returned from exile. On another level, however, this passage is a picture of something much grander and more far-reaching. The scope of the new covenant is universal. According to Paul (quoting from this passage), it will encompass the whole earth and every people group (Rom. 9:25–26). Every Christian can rejoice in this fuller meaning, for he or she is a demonstration of its ongoing fulfillment.

III.C. In That Day (2:16–23)

- 1. On That Day She Will Know My Love (2:16–20)
- 2. On That Day She Will Be Mine (2:21–23)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-193-2"></span><span id="page-193-1"></span><span id="page-193-0"></span>2:16–20 The Lord declares that on "that day," Israel will call him "My Husband" instead of "My Baal" (v. 16). This is a Hebrew play on words. On the one hand, it would be very natural for the Israelites to refer to the Lord as "baal," for this word can mean "husband" (as in Prov. 31:28; Est. 1:17), and one of the main points of Hosea is that the relationship between the Lord and Israel is like that of a husband and wife in covenant relationship. But the word "baal" can also refer to the false gods worshiped in Canaan—the very ones the Israelites had begun to worship. As a result, the Lord uses a different word for "husband" (*ish*) as a way to say, "On that day, they will be faithful to me and describe me as their Husband [*ish*], not confusing me with the false god of this land, Baal [*baʻal*]." No confusion between the Baal cult and the true worship of Israel's one true God will be allowed on "that day."

<span id="page-193-3"></span>The covenant will be not only with Israel but apparently with every living thing (Hos. 2:18); it is depicted as a cosmic renewal. Even "beasts" and "birds" will be included in the new arrangement between God and his people on that day.

The (new) covenant will bind the people in justice and righteousness, and they will "know" the Lord. To "know" is often a marital term, a euphemism for conjugal bliss. They will be intimate with their God—they will be true to the covenant and in their hearts will love him.

<span id="page-193-4"></span>2:21–23 The cosmic scope of the restored relationship is envisioned here: the heavens and earth are included. God will answer the need of heaven, and it will rain again. The rain will answer the need of the land, and it will be productive again. The earth will answer the need of grain and oil, and they will flourish again. God will sow Israel, fulfilling the name "Jezreel," which means "God sows." Sowing is a fertility image, which in this context means the population will increase as the land produces abundant food.

<span id="page-193-5"></span>The final beatitude of this future state is the promise that those who had been excluded from the covenant will be included (v. 23). Gomer's son "Not My People" will be renamed "my people," and he will reply, "You are my God." Thus the breached relationship will be restored.

### *Response*

The tension in Hosea between the future punishment of unbelieving Israel and the future establishment of Israel as a worshiping community is echoed in the book of Romans. There, Paul struggles with how it can be that his beloved people have largely abandoned the salvation provided for them, while the barbarians and profane peoples who cared nothing for God—and were his enemies in times past by plundering and devastating the people of the covenant—are now taking Jesus as their own and enjoying a salvation never imagined or envisioned. Paul's was an upside-down world, where those destined for glory found judgment, while those destined for judgment found glory.

Paul explains this by citing the book of Hosea, in which those who were not God's people now are, while those who were his people no longer are:

What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory — even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? As indeed he says in Hosea,

"Those who were not my people I will call 'my people,' and her who was not beloved I will call 'beloved.'" "And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'" (Rom. 9:22–26)

<span id="page-194-2"></span><span id="page-194-1"></span><span id="page-194-0"></span>As Paul goes on to say, the Gentiles experience such things because they have faith in Jesus (Rom. 9:30–33). It is only through him that we can know the Lord, enter into relationship with him, and boldly proclaim, "You are my God!"

## HOSEA 3:1–5

3 And the Lord said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins." **<sup>2</sup>** So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethech*<sup>1</sup>* of barley. **3**And I said to her, "You must dwell as mine for many days. You shall not play the whore, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you." **4**For the children of Israel shall dwell many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or household gods.

**<sup>5</sup>**Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and they shall come in fear to the Lord and to his goodness in the latter days.

III.D. Gomer Once More (3:1–5)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-195-2"></span><span id="page-195-1"></span>3:1–5 In this autobiographical sketch, the prophet tells his story, as once more he is called to image Yahweh. But is the woman he now pursues his wife, Gomer? The text does not explicitly identify her. She is an adulteress, and "another man" loves her (v. 1). But it would hardly make sense if this woman were not Gomer. The whole point seems to be that her estranged husband sought her out, did what was needed to redeem her from her lover, and brought her back into his house, at great cost to himself (silver and foodstuffs; v. 2). This extraordinary expression of love reflects how God has loved Israel. She, too, is faithless, and betrays her husband (the Lord) through her worship of other gods. Raisin cakes (v. 1)—which are mentioned along with "other gods"—were apparently an element of pagan religion, and their mention here underscores Israel's faithlessness. She loves her promiscuity.

<span id="page-195-4"></span><span id="page-195-3"></span>Hosea lays down the law to Gomer: she is to be celibate for a season. Her nymphomaniacal addiction must be cured through abstinence "for many days" (v. 3). Of course, he promises to abstain as well ("so will I also be to you"). This is a picture of the nation, which for "many days" would be bereft of idolatrous kings (v. 4). At the very least, this means that Israel would no longer be a sovereign nation. It may also be that her political leadership is mentioned in particular because it was the engine of false religion and is thus specifically targeted in order for false religion to stop as well. In either case, the destruction they will experience will be sufficiently thorough to wipe out political structures and worship practices ("without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or household gods"; v. 4).

<span id="page-195-5"></span><span id="page-195-0"></span>Soon after Hosea prophesied, Israel was ravaged, destroyed, and carried off to Assyria (2 Kings 18:9–12). But this was not to be the end for God's people in the land, as a return is promised (Hos. 3:5), which was fulfilled when exiled Judah returned from Babylonian captivity to "seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and . . . come in fear to the Lord." This word for "fear" usually implies dread or terror: Israel will have learned that the Lord truly does deal with sin harshly. Of course, this prophecy does not refer to the literal king David; instead, it looks to the hope for an anointed king sitting rightfully on David's throne in Jerusalem. Those estranged both from Yahweh and from his established king will seek them out and find well-being in a renewed relationship with their God.

### *Response*

<span id="page-196-4"></span><span id="page-196-3"></span><span id="page-196-2"></span><span id="page-196-1"></span><span id="page-196-0"></span>Hosea 2:2–3:5 is breathtaking in its scope. The passage begins with Yahweh utterly incensed over the crime of infidelity (2:2), determined to mete out an agonizing punishment (2:3) and to do away with this worthless spouse once and for all (2:3–5). From there the mood switches to the Lord's tenderhearted desire to win back Israel's love (2:6–8). Then God lays out a plan to make this a reality, including harsh but needed measures that will force her to change her attitude (2:9–13). He is portrayed as a jealous husband, musing about how it might be when his wife loves him exclusively (2:14–15). Finally, the prophet acts this out by buying back his lost wife and reinstating their vows (3:1–5).

<span id="page-196-6"></span><span id="page-196-5"></span>From an earthly perspective, if seems that this envisioned happy ending utterly failed to materialize, for either the northern or the southern kingdom. The northern kingdom only experienced God's wrath. And when the remnant of the southern kingdom returned from Babylonian exile, they did not appoint a Davidic king. From the time of their return to the time of Jesus, there was no king of David's lineage to command the loyalty of the faithful. Instead there were only terrible wars that resulted in tyrant after tyrant subjugating the land.

The tragic irony is that, after having gone through such pain and loss, when the Son of David finally did arrive, this same nation rejected him. They did not have him as their king. They did not follow him. And they did not enjoy his goodness in the latter days. Instead, there was rebellion after rebellion until the people of Israel were driven from the land by Rome and forced to wander in exile once again.

But some did have Jesus as their Lord and King. A remnant of Israel believed. And with them, streams of Gentiles from every nation turned from their false gods to embrace Jesus and his revealed Father. Those who were not the people of God, who were not numbered with the elect, are now welcomed into the kingdom of God. Thus the ultimate fulfillment of Hosea's prophecy goes far beyond anything expected or hoped for by the original hearers or perhaps even by the prophet himself.

<span id="page-196-9"></span>Consider Hosea's buying back his wife for a price. Note how this parallels the gospel. Paul wrote, "You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body" (1 Cor. 6:19b–20). This is from a larger section in 1 Corinthians concerning sexual purity in the church. As Hosea bought his wife and demanded her chastity, so also, instructs Paul, all Christians owe their Master heartfelt moral virtue and obedience. Thus Christians have an obligation—as surely as did ancient Israel—to live true to the covenant, including even in their sexual behavior.

<span id="page-196-8"></span><span id="page-196-7"></span>Perhaps at the end of this section of Hosea a Christian might pause and consider how very like Gomer or the idolatrous Israelites he or she might be. A person's loves defines that person. The Pharisees "loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God" (John 12:43). Someone who cares too much about what other people think or about winning their approval or respect or affection will be diminished in their valuation of the Father. Two masters cannot be served. Jesus declared, "Whoever loves his life loses it" (John 12:25). Whatever a person loves determines what motivates that person—either love for God or love

for other things. Remember, we have been bought with a price, like Gomer, and therefore we owe our Lord all our heart.

<span id="page-197-1"></span>The Father will discipline us in order to loosen the grip of these idolatries in our hearts. This process will be painful. But a day is coming in which all of those things that compete with our love for God will be put in proper perspective. On that day we will in full measure bask in the goodness of our salvation.

## OVERVIEW OF

## HOSEA 4:1–11:11

The next major section of Hosea begins by calling out Israel. Yahweh "has a controversy" with his people. His accusation unfolds in a series of oracles directed at every stratum of society, starting with those who claim to speak for God: prophets and priests. This section, encompassing roughly half of the book, can be divided into seven subsections:

- <span id="page-197-0"></span>A. Israel Is a Whore! (4:1–5:7)
- <span id="page-197-3"></span>B. Death Sentence and Beyond (5:8–6:3)
- C. What Shall I Do with You? (6:4–7:16)
- D. Israel Has Forgotten His Maker (8:1–14)
- E. Woe When I Depart from Them! (9:1–17)
- F. The Calf and the People (10:1–15)
- G. My Heart Recoils within Me (11:1–11)

The historical narratives chronicling Hosea's pursuit of Gomer as an illustration of how Yahweh will deal with Israel are now finished, having served as the foundation upon which the ensuing oracles will be built. When continuing on, the reader must keep in mind the estranged relationship between Israel and her Maker. For example, the estrangement surfaces again in Yahweh's accusation that "they have left their God to play the whore" (4:12); Israel is wanton in her adulterous ways.

<span id="page-197-2"></span>This theme of whoredom is especially evident in the first subsection (4:1–5:7), which describes how the people have turned from God to false deities. This fundamentally misplaced faith is fertile ground for all sorts of sin, such as unethical dealings and bloodshed.

<span id="page-197-4"></span>In the second section, Yahweh unleashes his fury against his people's sin (5:8–6:3). Foolishly, they will turn to other nations for deliverance—nations that cannot save them. Salvation will come only by turning back to the Lord with a repentant heart, and the section ends with some hope that they will do so (6:1–3).

<span id="page-198-3"></span>The very next section again emphasizes the failure of the Lord's people to truly return to him (6:4–7:16). Wickedness still abounds, and when the Lord's discipline comes, they do not turn to him in repentance but instead attempt various political fixes in order to save their skin.

<span id="page-198-4"></span>This continues in the section that follows (8:1–14). The Lord's people continue to rebel against his covenant, and when the Lord's justice comes, they do not come to him in repentant faith but instead look to the nations for salvation. The Lord thus makes clear that they are headed for dissolution: away to Assyria they will go forever. It will be as if Yahweh never rescued them from Egypt in the first place.

<span id="page-198-5"></span>The theme of spiritual adultery's leading to exile continues in the next section (9:1–17). Hosea emphasizes that Israel will be removed from the land, their relationship to Yahweh severed and the nation wiped out. Israel had turned to Baal and the Canaanite cult for fertility, and so, in a punishment that fits their crime, the Lord will ensure that they have no progeny. Theirs will be the last generation, and they will wander among the nations.

<span id="page-198-6"></span><span id="page-198-2"></span>The section that follows makes clear that the central problem of Ephraim (i.e., Israel; cf. comment on 4:17–19) is that the true and living God of their fathers, Yahweh, has been rejected for various substitutes (10:1–15). Their golden calf signals their resistance to godly counsel and prophetic warning, and other counterfeits are in operation as well. The people trust in treaties and political intrigue. They trust in their own abilities and competencies, in their military might and fortresses. All of these false refuges and spurious gods must go (10:1–15).

<span id="page-198-7"></span><span id="page-198-1"></span><span id="page-198-0"></span>Having said all of this, the Lord then reveals his inner ambivalence in the last section (11:1–11). He is like the father of a felon who deserves capital punishment. What should a father do? Love his son, or let justice destroy him? In the end, having wrestled with this inner conflict, Yahweh decides that he will not destroy his son after all but will instead bring him back after a period of chastisement. It is on this note that the great major section in Hosea, chapters 4–11, closes.

## HOSEA 4:1–5:7

4 Hear the word of the Lord, O children of Israel, for the Lord has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or steadfast love, and no knowledge of God in the land;

- **<sup>2</sup>** there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
- **<sup>3</sup>** Therefore the land mourns, and all who dwell in it languish,

 and also the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, and even the fish of the sea are taken away.

- **<sup>4</sup>** Yet let no one contend, and let none accuse, for with you is my contention, O priest.*<sup>1</sup>*
- **<sup>5</sup>** You shall stumble by day; the prophet also shall stumble with you by night; and I will destroy your mother.
- **<sup>6</sup>** My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
- **<sup>7</sup>** The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will change their glory into shame.
- **<sup>8</sup>** They feed on the sin*<sup>2</sup>* of my people; they are greedy for their iniquity.
- **<sup>9</sup>** And it shall be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
- **<sup>10</sup>** They shall eat, but not be satisfied; they shall play the whore, but not multiply, because they have forsaken the Lord to cherish **11**whoredom, wine, and new wine, which take away the understanding.
- **<sup>12</sup>** My people inquire of a piece of wood, and their walking staff gives them oracles. For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have left their God to play the whore.
- **<sup>13</sup>** They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good.
- Therefore your daughters play the whore, and your brides commit adultery.

**<sup>14</sup>** I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go aside with prostitutes and sacrifice with cult prostitutes, and a people without understanding shall come to ruin.

- **<sup>15</sup>** Though you play the whore, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. Enter not into Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, and swear not, "As the Lord lives."
- **<sup>16</sup>** Like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn;

## *Section Overview*

As does every major section in Hosea following the introduction, this one begins with "a controversy" (Hb. *rib*), that is, an accusation or legal case against Israel. In Israel's day, as in our own, formal lawsuits would involve certain elements, such as the calling of witnesses and cross-examination. It is therefore no surprise to find such elements included in the Lord's lawsuit against Israel here, and the comments below will use legal terminology as appropriate in order to make these elements clear.12

<span id="page-200-0"></span><sup>12</sup> For similar examples of the lawsuit genre in the Minor Prophets see Amos 3 and Micah 6.

<span id="page-201-5"></span>This passage is bound together by the theme of whoredom/harlotry. The "spirit of whoredom" (4:12; 5:4) is spoken of in various ways. Israel is said to cherish it. They are led by it. They are joined to idols. Their leaders are no better. They have become alien to God.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-201-1"></span>4:1–3 Hosea cries out, "Hear the word of the Lord, . . . for the Lord has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land" (v. 1). His accusation is simple: "There is no faithfulness or steadfast love, and no knowledge of God in the land." The term translated "faithfulness" can also be translated "truth": there is no fidelity, no honesty, no commitment to the truth of God in the land. "Steadfast love" translates the Hebrew term *hesed*, which connotes covenant fidelity or loyalty. The passionate God desires such love from his beloved and is righteously angered when they are lukewarm toward him. Finally, the "knowledge of God" refers to more than correct theology; it describes those who show they know God through their faithfulness to his covenant (6:6; cf. also 4:6; 5:4). Yet these traits are absent among God's people.

<span id="page-201-4"></span>Instead, the people of God break his Ten Commandments by swearing (the 3rd commandment), lying (9th), murdering (6th), stealing (8th), and committing adultery (7th).13 Notice that God's first complaint is not that Israel is worshiping Baal; instead, he addresses Israel's moral compass. To deviate from the revealed moral code is to lose any connection or relationship with the Lord. Bloodshed has become a defining characteristic of God's people. Near the end of the northern kingdom (and Hosea's ministry), kings followed kings in rapid succession, usually through assassination. Violence had become the order of the day.

<span id="page-201-6"></span><span id="page-201-3"></span>In light of this sin, the Lord brings his justice to bear. The consequences are severe enough that the land "mourns" (4:3), which is the usual use of this word, although in some contexts it can refer to drought in particular (cf. Amos 1:2). If the same is true here, this is a direct swipe at the storm god Baal. In any case, the

<span id="page-201-0"></span><sup>13</sup> Cf. Exodus 20:7, 13–16. In this context, "swearing" refers to misuse of the Lord's name (Ex. 20:7), perhaps by taking an oath in his name and then lying or otherwise breaking it.

<span id="page-202-0"></span>punishment will be so severe that even the animals will experience its consequences (cf. Deut. 28:18).

<span id="page-202-6"></span>This passage may be considered the opening statement of a legal case, in which the defendant is called to the stand and charges are read (Hos. 4:1–3). Next is a list of suspects, with more specific charges against them (vv. 4–6). What is driving this trial is the heart of God, who desires love and fidelity from him people.

<span id="page-202-9"></span><span id="page-202-8"></span><span id="page-202-5"></span>4:4–6 The verbal form of the term translated "controversy" in verse 1 (Hb. *rib*) is used twice in verse 4, highlighting that the ongoing monologue is in the context of legal accusation. There is some question concerning how to translate the second part of verse 4. The main text of the ESV involves a slight emendation of the Hebrew, with the result that the Lord begins to address the priests in particular. In favor of this, the word "you" clearly refers to the priests in verse 6, and the priests seem to be the focus of this section.

<span id="page-202-1"></span>The so-called priests of the northern kingdom had been appointed by Jeroboam at the founding of the nation many generations before (1 Kings 13:33). This non-Levitical caste had never served in accordance with the law of Moses, instead ministering before golden calves representing Yahweh and established by Jeroboam at Bethel and Dan. Scripture is united in its witness that this was a counterfeit cult, worthy of nothing but contempt from a true worshiper of God (2 Kings 17:21–22; 2 Chron. 11:14).

<span id="page-202-10"></span><span id="page-202-4"></span><span id="page-202-3"></span><span id="page-202-2"></span>The judgment of the Lord is then announced: the priest "shall stumble by day," and the prophet "shall stumble with you by night" (Hos. 4:5). The word "stumble" is often used to refer to the Lord's judgment that comes on the unfaithful in such a way that their ultimate end is to fall and be destroyed (Isa. 3:8; 31:3). "Day . . . [and] night" is a figure of speech called a *merism*, in which two opposites convey a complete whole. The phrase is used here to indicate that priests and prophets will have no chance to escape their deserved fate.

<span id="page-202-13"></span>Prophets are lumped together with priests as those who claim to know but in fact only deceive. Both Israel and Judah were filled with false prophets. Their spiritual state of affairs was so bad that, in the Minor Prophets, Amos was embarrassed to be called a prophet (Amos 7:14), while Micah soundly critiqued them (Mic. 3:11). Zephaniah also treated prophets and priests as particularly guilty before God (Zeph. 3:4). Zechariah predicts a time when prophets will be ashamed to call themselves prophets (Zech. 13:4–5).14

<span id="page-202-16"></span><span id="page-202-15"></span><span id="page-202-14"></span><span id="page-202-12"></span>The passage then returns to the priests in particular and gets to the heart of the issue: a fundamental rejection of true knowledge of God (Hos. 4:6). A substitute savior, a cheap knockoff of the real thing, is all they represent to the people. The very officials who took upon themselves the mantle of teachers do not know the truth about God, and as a result the people suffer: "My people are destroyed for

<span id="page-202-11"></span><span id="page-202-7"></span><sup>14</sup> The phrase "I will destroy your mother" (v. 5) is highly debated. Some understand this to describe a punishment of the actual mothers of the priests; some see it as a metaphorical way to describe the land (cf. v. 3) or a royal city in which the priests lived; still others emend the text to give a different sense altogether ("you will perish in terror" [Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 70]).

lack of knowledge." Thus the spiritual adultery and religious guilt accrued by the nation can be laid at their door. God's response is that since they have forgotten his law, he will "forget [their] children": he will disown the priests from participation in his promises and protection.

These verses condemn priest and prophet, the people and the nation. The whole religious and political system has failed to preserve the knowledge of God and has in fact rejected him. The defendants have been named, and specific crimes delineated, in this lawsuit.

<span id="page-203-1"></span><span id="page-203-0"></span>4:7–11 The previous passage featured second-person direct address, while here the priests are spoken of in the third person. Consider how deeply the living God despises the "ministry" of those who purport to speak for him: he will convert their "glory" (v. 7)—the honor and respect they enjoy in the community—into shame. In the end, their misrepresentations and foolish assertions will be exposed for what they are. They spoke of divine matters about which they had no real knowledge.

<span id="page-203-2"></span>The priests are said to "feed on the sin of my people" (v. 8)—they eat from the worthless sacrifices (probably offered at the shrines of the golden calf). This iniquity literally is their bread and butter. The people and the priest are alike, the Lord declares; together the whole culture is corrupt and must go. Israel's jealous lover will make sure they face the consequences of their deviant behavior. Indeed, as a judgment for sin, the activities they engage in will not have their normal effects: they will "eat" but find no satisfaction; they will fornicate "but not multiply" (v. 10).

<span id="page-203-4"></span><span id="page-203-3"></span>The priests have abandoned the One who loves and provides for them and have instead kept faith with spiritual whoredom and wine—ruining the understanding of God's people (v. 11).15 It is as if an unscrupulous marriage counselor, the priest, has for his own benefit ruined the marriage by lying about the husband. Jesus declared that special judgment was in store for anyone who "causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin" (Matt. 18:6). Those with authority over others will face increased scrutiny for the ways in which they use that authority.

<span id="page-203-11"></span><span id="page-203-7"></span><span id="page-203-6"></span>4:12–14 The terms "piece of wood" and "staff" (v. 12) may allude to the worship of Asherah, the Canaanite goddess of erotic love often represented by a wooden pole. The phrase "spirit of whoredom" probably does not imply the work of literal spirits but instead most likely refers to a shared attitude that influences the people in a certain deviant way, leading them to spiritual unfaithfulness and to seeking guidance from cultic objects, perhaps Asherah poles.

<span id="page-203-9"></span><span id="page-203-8"></span>Apparently, actual fornication and harlotry are occurring at some places of worship (vv. 13–14). It has been suggested that prostitution was an element of cultic worship practice, and verse 13 thus connects cultic activities with women who "play the whore." But they are not the only guilty ones. Male worshipers are the ones who hire the prostitutes as part of their idolatry (v. 14). These activities

<span id="page-203-10"></span><span id="page-203-5"></span><sup>15</sup> The first word in the Hebrew of 4:12 may belong at the end of 4:11, yielding, ". . . which take away the understanding of my people"; 4:12 would then begin, "He consults a piece of wood . . ."

<span id="page-204-2"></span>show that the people lack "understanding" (v. 14; cf. v. 6), and the result of such activities will be utter "ruin" for those who practice them.

<span id="page-204-9"></span><span id="page-204-3"></span>4:15–16 These verses include a rare mention of Judah in the book of Hosea. Apparently, Judah is not (yet) guilty of this particular form of idolatry. Although a calf is not specifically cited, the illegal cult of the golden calf is mentioned here for the first time (on the golden calf in Hosea, cf. comment on 8:4b–6). In order to make the heinous nature of the sin clear, the name of the city housing the shrine has been purposefully changed from "Bethel" ("House of God"), to the more accurate "Beth-aven" ("House of Iniquity"). Another shrine has apparently been set up in Gilgal. Yahweh wants nothing to do with this idolatrous worship, in which he is represented as a calf: "Swear not, 'As the Lord lives!'" The true and living God rejects this idolatry; he simply cannot stand their so-called worship. Their cult and their conduct is so far from what the holy God desires in his people that he wants nothing to do with them.

<span id="page-204-5"></span><span id="page-204-4"></span>It is not God who is like a calf—it is Israel (4:16). Like a heifer, they are stubborn and headstrong. It would be better if Israel were compliant like a lamb, allowing her master to lead her (v. 16b). Instead, because of Israel's waywardness, stubbornness, idolatry, and spirit of whoredom, she cannot be pastured or led to a better condition. God will not bless such a recalcitrant people. The accused criminal will have no plea to make before the court.

<span id="page-204-6"></span>4:17–19 Here, for the first of thirty-two times in the book, Hosea uses his favorite synonym for Israel: "Ephraim." Ephraim was a "half-tribe" that stretched across the center of the Promised Land, serving as the heartland of Israel. Near its border was Bethel (the shrine of the golden calf) and Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been set up in earlier days. Ephraim represented the wayward heart of the people; it was the stubborn stronghold of prevailing idolatry and appropriately described as being "joined to idols."

<span id="page-204-7"></span>5:1–2 Judgment is pronounced specifically against the priesthood, king, and (apparently) the nobles of Israel. These leaders have spiritually entrapped people throughout the land (namely at Mount Tabor and Mizpah, perhaps sites where Israel worshiped false gods). The privileged class led the land in apostasy.

<span id="page-204-8"></span><span id="page-204-1"></span><span id="page-204-0"></span>The first part of verse 2 is difficult to translate. The ESV renders it as "And the revolters have gone deep into slaughter," while the RSV reads, "And they have made deep the pit of Shittim." In this latter reading, the listing of place names from verse 1 is continued. Shittim is where Israel "began to whore" by joining themselves with Baal (Num. 25:1–5). Thus the evil of this idolatry has been compounded with murder ("slaughter"), warranting a harsh response. The worthless, rebellious priesthood and the short-lived kings will be treated as they deserve: the Lord will discipline them all (Hos. 5:2). The word for "discipline" used here (*musar*) often refers to instruction designed to correct bad behavior, using painful means (cf. Isa. 26:16; Jer. 5:3; Job 5:17; Prov. 3:11).

<span id="page-205-2"></span>5:3–4 This unit is set apart by the device of inclusio, whereby the same word in Hebrew ("know") begins and ends the unit. Yahweh knows Ephraim/Israel, but they do not "know" him. He knows their deeds, which prevent their returning (*shub*) to the Lord. Due to their spirit of whoredom, the Israelites are incapable of either knowing or pursuing their covenant partner.

Theologically speaking, this may be labeled "total depravity," in the sense that no aspect of the people's collective personality is untouched by the spirit of spiritual apostasy. Their inner minds lead to visible deeds, which make impossible any sense of repentance or turning to God. It is this state of reprobation that they cannot change and, apart from an act of providential grace on God's part, can never change. At this stage, no simple appeal to listen will be heard, for they cannot listen. In other words, the call to hear in verse 1 stands as a rhetorical witness against the people. Their inability to heed is part of the complex of hardened rebellion. It is as if they were criminally insane, psychopaths with no conscience, unable to function normally. It takes more than prophetic appeal to reason with such people. Other measures are required to wake them from their deathly stupor.

<span id="page-205-4"></span><span id="page-205-3"></span><span id="page-205-1"></span>5:5–7 The "pride" of Israel "testifies" against it (v. 5)—yet another witness to the guilt of the accused. The sentencing portion of the trial is stated here in part: Israel will fall and will take Judah with it.

<span id="page-205-5"></span>The worst part of this judgment is that when it falls, Israel will seek after Yahweh in vain. The people will take flocks and herds to make sacrifices and seek the Lord but will be unable to find him (v. 6). He will have left, sick of their treachery and their religious festivals that ignored his revealed truth. Because of their unfaithfulness, God's people have become an "alien" generation (v. 7). They are foreign to God and for all practical purposes are Gentiles.

<span id="page-205-6"></span>The section ends with an obscure word of judgment: "the new moon shall devour them with their fields." Perhaps the subject of the verb is implied to be Yahweh himself, yielding, "Now he will consume their portion at the new moon."16 In this alternative reading, a judgment of God is prophesied for the very near future, perhaps at the time of an idolatrous holy day connected with the new moon. However verse 7b is translated, this section as a whole makes clear that the people are completely alienated from the Lord.

### <span id="page-205-7"></span>*Response*

Not every religion is alike, nor do all faiths produce the same fruit. There is an inner connection between abandoning Yahweh for Baal and abandoning morality and ethical dealings with one's neighbor. People become like that which they worship, and Baal and his pantheon are disgusting, immoral, violent personalities.

<span id="page-205-0"></span>One example of this in Scripture is the account of Naboth's vineyard in 1 Kings 21. In true faithfulness to the Lord, Naboth would not relinquish his

<sup>16</sup> Andersen and Freedman, *Hosea*, 396–397; with reference to the problems with the current Hebrew text, they note, "No one has ever explained how the new moon could eat fields" (396).

land, which he considered his family's inheritance from God. But Jezebel, a Baal worshiper, apparently could not comprehend this attitude. Land to her was a commodity to be bought and sold at will, without sacred meaning. To acquire it, she arranged Naboth's death. This story is recorded in the Bible not as an isolated incident but in order to show that Baal worship produces this sort of greedy, bloodthirsty behavior, and that a government that has abandoned respect for Yahweh cannot be trusted to respect Yahweh's citizens. At issue was not only which deity to serve, but also by which political and economic system to live.17 In the same way, Hosea critiques not only the false god the people worship but also the ethical and moral corruption that necessarily followed (Hos. 4:1–3).

<span id="page-206-0"></span>It is not hard to transfer this basic insight into the modern world. Throughout the twentieth century, governments that explicitly embraced atheism treated their citizenry with similar contempt, causing death by the scores of millions. The crumbling of the "moral fabric" of a society committed to secular humanism is just as inevitable. The charge that God leveled against ancient Israel could just as easily be leveled against the whole of Western civilization today.

<span id="page-206-3"></span><span id="page-206-2"></span><span id="page-206-1"></span>The great question becomes, how will God's people, the church of Jesus Christ, respond in the midst of this? In Hosea's day, it was the leaders of the people who earned God's particular ire (4:4–10). Similarly, Jesus condemned the religious leaders of his day as hypocrites (Matthew 23). James warns that not many should aspire to be teachers (James 3:1). Leaders in the church are charged with calling the people of God to his truth. In the light of the gospel, all Christians, but especially their leaders, should be visibly distinguished from the apostasy of the world as it now is. The ethical and moral caliber of those who call on the name of Jesus should be recognizable as a cut above. The church is the bride of Christ and as such should be head-over-heels in love with him. As mentioned, this is particularly true of leaders: if they are unable or unwilling to lead their people on this difficult path, they will also warrant God's ire and his condemnation of their works.

There were two major spiritual problems with Israel. One was out-and-out Baal worship. Baal was the anti-Yahweh, the alternative religion. As an element of his fertility cult, the people were led astray by sex and money. Baal worship was concerned with nothing besides sensuality and power. There was no mention in the Baal epic of a covenant being made with his people, whereby he expected obedience and righteousness of them.

The other spiritual problem of Israel was subtler and harder to identify and critique. It was a corruption of legitimate Yahweh worship. Yahweh was represented by golden calves at shrines maintained by priests. No doubt many of the traditions of Israel were taught and cherished—their worship partially followed what Moses specified—but pagan elements were added. This is called *syncretism*, and it calls for a sober review of Christian worship today.

<sup>17</sup> Judith Todd, "The Pre-Deuteronomic Elijah Cycle," in *Elijah and Elisha in Socioliterary Perspective*, ed. Robert Coote (Atlanta: Scholars, 1992), 1–35.

Have syncretistic elements of an unbelieving culture been adopted by various denominations and churches, incorporated into today's worship experience? The ruling body of any church should carefully and prayerfully seek wisdom and discernment on these matters, lest the parishioners imbibe a mixed message concerning the character of God.

<span id="page-207-0"></span>In every Christian's heart are also elements of sub-Christian thinking. These need to be weeded out through sound teaching, sober meditation on the Word of God, and a willingness to change accordingly.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-208-2"></span><span id="page-208-0"></span>In this section, Yahweh has determined to unleash his fury. The people call for the horn to be blown, for the enemies are at the gates (5:8). God's people have realized they cannot stand without help. But to whom have they turned? Not to the one who could save them. No, they have turned in their folly to Assyria (5:13). The great irony of this is, of course, that it is Assyria who historically terrorized the Lord's people and carried them into exile. Perhaps this is how God tore his people as a lion would (5:14). None will rescue. None *can* rescue. The Lord's discipline will be heavy on his people until "they acknowledge their guilt" and "earnestly seek" him (5:15). He does not desire their death; he desires their repentance.

<span id="page-208-5"></span><span id="page-208-4"></span><span id="page-208-3"></span>A picture of repentance is indeed the very next thing we see. Hosea gives voice to the people's turning, seeking after God, and looking to him for healing (6:1–3). It is a hopeful picture, a strong affirmation that when the Lord's people truly repent, he restores them to life—he brings them back from the dead (6:2).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-208-9"></span><span id="page-208-8"></span><span id="page-208-7"></span>5:8–9 A call is issued to blow the trumpet and shout, citing specific military installations and strongholds (v. 8). This rhetoric invokes the panic of an invasion, the anticipation of imminent battle. Joel 2:1–11 uses similar language, graphically depicting an invading army and what it will mean for the inhabitants of Zion. Nahum 2 describes Nineveh's imminent fall, complete with chariots rushing through the streets, the vain cry of "Halt! Halt!," and the image of lions with their prey (Nah. 2:11–12). The same sense of distress is invoked by Hosea here in his presentation of what it will be like for Israel on the last day.

Gibeah and Ramah were in the southern part of the northern kingdom, as were Bethel (Beth-aven)18 and Benjamin. Apparently, Benjamin is envisioned as the front line, after which Ephraim follows. The placement of the cities suggests an invasion from Judah, but historically the real danger was not Judah but Assyria. Eventually the terror-inspiring, sadistic Assyrian forces overran the nation and utterly destroyed its culture.

<span id="page-209-6"></span>These verses end with a haunting phrase: "I make known what is sure" (Hos. 5:9). What is "sure"? The armies of Israel were not sure, reliable, dependable, or trustworthy. Their fortifications, political alliances, ability to pay tribute, or wherewithal were not sure. Trusting in man, trusting in fortresses, trusting in money, or trusting in one's own strength is not sure. These are the things in which wayward Israel trusted. But the Lord will reveal in the day of punishment what is sure—and what is not.

<span id="page-209-8"></span><span id="page-209-7"></span><span id="page-209-1"></span>5:10–13 This passage speaks to a time when both Judah and Israel have offended their God, as both are mentioned throughout. To "move the landmark" (v. 10) is to undermine the social and ethical order of society. It is to tamper with a foundational aspect of civilization. The ancient landmarks were generational standards on which matters of inheritance and land rights were based (Deut. 19:14). Similar meddling might involve using dishonest scales in business transactions (Prov. 20:23) or committing perjury in a trial that depends on the truth to make just judgments (Num. 30:2). The political leadership ("princes") of Judah committed an analogous crime, possibly by annexing land belonging to Israel, thus literally moving a political boundary. Because of this, God will pour out his wrath like water. Judah will be deluged in the coming judgment.

<span id="page-209-9"></span><span id="page-209-4"></span><span id="page-209-3"></span><span id="page-209-0"></span>Yet Ephraim deserves no better treatment. They asked for it. Before their final demise, they felt crushing oppression at the hands of Assyria because they went after "filth" (Hos. 5:11). The Hebrew word is not exactly "filth." It is pronounced something like a sneeze, perhaps with a "z" sound at the start. In Isaiah 28:10–13 it is glossed "precept" but might instead simply be a nonsense word, used to depict the babbling of the prophets. Perhaps it could be expressed as the sound of putting one's tongue out and blowing. Thus this phrase would be rendered, "Ephraim was pleased to go after brrrpt!" This is in contrast to going after Yahweh (Hos. 11:10).

<span id="page-209-10"></span>In 5:12 we find two startling images for the great creator of heaven and earth: he describes himself to be like "a moth" and like "dry rot." These both gnaw away at originally new and pristine material. Moth larvae chew holes in clothing and leave worms in foodstuffs, spoiling it. The word for "dry rot" can be used also to refer to sickness and decay in general. Job 13:28 uses the same words in parallel to describe a man who is wasting away. In short, the Lord will erode and dilapidate these two nations; they will suffer as with a festering disease.

<span id="page-209-11"></span><span id="page-209-5"></span><span id="page-209-2"></span>It is thus no surprise that the next verse speaks of the nations' "sickness" and "wound" (Hos. 5:13). Perhaps these two nations wounded each other through war and then looked to Assyria to "cure" them of their "wound" and "sickness," that is, to help them militarily. Of course, the king of Assyria could not help them. How could he, since Yahweh was the one who had afflicted them?

The king of Assyria is given an obscure title here. As in 10:6, the Hebrew reads, "King Jareb" (cf. ESV mg.); the ESV aptly glosses "the great king."19

<span id="page-210-6"></span>5:14–15 These verses emphasize both the discipline of the Lord and its purpose in turning his people back to him. Previously the images for divine discipline involved putrefaction and decomposition, but here God is the most powerful carnivore, a lion seeking its prey. He promises to tear up his people like a predator would, leaving their carcass exposed to scavengers and vermin. He will then apparently carry the kill to his den, from whence there is no return. No hope remains for a lifeless and torn carcass.

<span id="page-210-10"></span><span id="page-210-2"></span><span id="page-210-1"></span>The phrase "no one shall rescue" can be found eleven times in Scripture, often using the image of a lion or other aggressive species. Isaiah, for instance, declares of the surrounding nations, "Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey; they carry it off, and none can rescue" (Isa. 5:29; cf. Mic. 5:8, which uses the image in a positive light).20 There is finality to this image. It is like Daniel's being cast into the lions' den (Daniel 6)—he had passed the point of no return, into the sphere of death. Humanly speaking, there was no possibility of deliverance. But the situation in Hosea is worse than that. Unlike Daniel, in Hosea the victim is actually ravaged and torn open. Thus a better analogy would be Daniel's accusers, who were thrown into the den after him and crushed (Dan. 6:24). They perished—as Israel will soon perish, when the Lion strikes.

<span id="page-210-5"></span><span id="page-210-3"></span>The first-person pronoun is repeated to emphasize that this is Yahweh himself who promises with a certainty that such judgment will happen: "I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and no one shall rescue" (Hos. 5:14). God will personally and unreservedly ruin them.

<span id="page-210-7"></span>But destruction is not the ultimate goal. All of the discipline God brings on his people is meant to lead them to "acknowledge their guilt" (v. 15). Just as a child sometimes needs severe discipline in order to help him understand the severity of his wrong and to turn from it, so it is with the people of the Lord. In this case, the discipline will be a time of great distress, but the goal is that in this distress they will earnestly seek him.

<span id="page-210-9"></span><span id="page-210-8"></span><span id="page-210-4"></span>6:1–3 The prophet now desperately calls the people to respond in faith to the terrible threat of judgment just unleashed. In language as clear and evocative as the earlier call to "Blow the horn in Gibeah" (5:8), Hosea models the verbiage of a humbled people: "Come, let us return [*shub*] to the Lord" (6:1). Hosea gives voice to a penitential prayer, the proper response to God's final word of warning.

<sup>19</sup> The root of this Hebrew word could be *rib*, "to contend." Thus Cornelis van Leeuwen suggests that Hosea used a nickname, "King Bellicosity." If this is correct, Hosea may be rebuking Israel and Judah for involving the king of Assyria. They are playing with fire by inviting him into their contention ("Meaning and Structure of Hosea X 1–8," *VT* 53/3 [2003]: 375).

<span id="page-210-0"></span><sup>20</sup> See also Judges 18:28; 2 Samuel 14:6; Job 5:4; Psalms 7:2; 50:22; 71:11; Isaiah 42:22; Daniel 8:4.

The prophet makes clear the purpose of their suffering: "He has torn us, that he may heal us." It is clear that Yahweh is the one who brings his punishment to bear, just as he is the one who can bring healing and hope. He is therefore the one to whom they must look.

<span id="page-211-5"></span>The promise of healing and helping to recover from injury blossoms into an expectation of full restoration of life: "He will *revive us*; . . . he will *raise us up*, that we may *live* before him" (v. 2). The phrase "after two days . . . on the third day" follows a common poetic device of naming a certain number of things ("two days") and then in the very next breath adding one to the number ("third day"). Compare Amos 1:3: "For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment" (cf. also Prov. 30:15–31). In this case, the length of time might not refer to two or three actual days but could be a way of saying that Israel can hope for such healing in the very near future—a pattern realized in Jesus Christ, who indeed arose on a literal "third day."

<span id="page-211-4"></span><span id="page-211-0"></span>This section ends with the hoped-for speech of a people who have, in their hearts, returned to their God. "Let us press on," they are imagined as saying (Hos. 6:3). The Lord's coming is as certain as the sunrise and will be life-giving. He will refresh them as showers of rain—exactly what they used to expect from Baal. They are imagined as sweetly returning to the Lord, recognizing in him all they ever wanted from their false gods, especially from Baal, the bringer of rain. But sadly, as the next verses will show, this type of repentance never took place in that era.

### *Response*

<span id="page-211-2"></span>God says that his people "go after filth" (5:11). What Ephraim trusted and invested in was "brrrpt!" How close to home is this indictment for Christians today? Do we, like Ephraim, chase after things that amount to nothing? Are we distracted by nonsense and frivolity from our mission as God's people to reach the lost, build his kingdom, and live as his church? If so, what will it take to wake us up to the seriousness of the times in which we live?

<span id="page-211-1"></span>It was suggested above that God's people, having experienced severe discipline, may someday fully expect to live again. But when? This anticipated national resurrection will happen after two days. On the third day, "He will raise us up, that we may live before him" (6:2). Isaiah 26:19 predicts that Israel's dead shall live again; "their bodies shall rise." Jonah was as good as dead in the heart of the sea, yet on the third day he returned to the land of the living.

<span id="page-211-7"></span><span id="page-211-3"></span>Perhaps Paul had Hosea 6:2 in mind when he wrote that Jesus "was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures" (1 Cor. 15:4). Jesus also said, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead" (Luke 24:46). There is no text more anticipatory of this in all of Scripture than Hosea 6:2.

<span id="page-211-6"></span>Jesus stood in the place of his people and took their punishment. The fury and hurt of God due to his people's infidelity was unleashed in full upon this one man. But, after three days, this one man did literally rise again in the place of the people. Thus the suffering set before Ephraim and Judah due to their sin, and the blessing to follow, did in fact come to pass—in some measure through the Babylonian exile and subsequent restoration but in full measure in Christ. The heartfelt two-sided passions of God find their ultimate resolution not in the history of Judah but in the gospel of Jesus. Jesus puts on display the wisdom of God, who skillfully and masterfully orchestrated such a great salvation for an undeserving people (1 Cor. 1:26–31).

<span id="page-212-1"></span><span id="page-212-0"></span>What should be the response of Christians to this? Let us press on to know the Lord, for his great salvation and blessings to us are as sure as the dawn, as refreshing as the spring rains. Let us also put away any vain thought of finding refuge or security in anything else, be it political alliances or our own pocketbooks. Let us no longer trust in other people for our well-being, but in faith let us look to Jesus.

## HOSEA 6:4–7:16

- **<sup>4</sup>** What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away.
- **<sup>5</sup>** Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light.
- **<sup>6</sup>** For I desire steadfast love*<sup>1</sup>* and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
- **<sup>7</sup>** But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me.
- **<sup>8</sup>** Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood.
- **<sup>9</sup>** As robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together; they murder on the way to Shechem; they commit villainy.
- **<sup>10</sup>** In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's whoredom is there; Israel is defiled.
- **<sup>11</sup>** For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.

When I restore the fortunes of my people,

- 7 when I would heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim is revealed, and the evil deeds of Samaria, for they deal falsely; the thief breaks in,
- and the bandits raid outside.
- **<sup>2</sup>** But they do not consider that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds surround them; they are before my face.
- **<sup>3</sup>** By their evil they make the king glad, and the princes by their treachery.
- **<sup>4</sup>** They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven whose baker ceases to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
- **<sup>5</sup>** On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.
- **<sup>6</sup>** For with hearts like an oven they approach their intrigue; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
- **<sup>7</sup>** All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen, and none of them calls upon me.
- **<sup>8</sup>** Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
- **<sup>9</sup>** Strangers devour his strength, and he knows it not; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knows it not.
- **<sup>10</sup>** The pride of Israel testifies to his face;*<sup>2</sup>* yet they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek him, for all this.
- **<sup>11</sup>** Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria.
- **<sup>12</sup>** As they go, I will spread over them my net; I will bring them down like birds of the heavens; I will discipline them according to the report made to their congregation.
- **<sup>13</sup>** Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them,

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-214-0"></span>Here again the perspective of Hosea toward Judah is on display: together with Israel, Judah is held to account (cf. 5:5, 13–14). Again and again God has tried to get their attention, to no avail. The harsh words from his spokesmen have had no effect (6:5). The extent of their pollution is here spelled out in detail.

<span id="page-214-4"></span><span id="page-214-3"></span><span id="page-214-2"></span>The priests in particular are murderers and robbers, either literally or metaphorically (6:9). As for the people, they have become rotten to the core, from the east (Adam) to the west (Shechem) (6:7, 9), in the nations of both Israel/Ephraim and Judah (6:10–11). God's blessing becomes just another opportunity to commit acts of injustice, from which the establishment profits.

<span id="page-214-5"></span>In desperation Ephraim (Israel), when Assyria ran amok through the land, attempted various political fixes, such as paying tribute or forming alliances to stave off utter destruction. Their kings and leaders did not generally last long, as the throne in Israel had become a prize for opportunists with no thought for God or his people (7:3–7). All the way until the time of their final destruction, they did not turn to the Lord for help. The tragedy is that he was there all along and would have saved them if only they had known him.

<span id="page-214-8"></span><span id="page-214-7"></span><span id="page-214-6"></span>Not only did they not know him; they also spoke lies about him (7:13). In their folly and ignorance they trusted in other things to save them, such as Egypt's help or their ability to pay tribute (7:11). This led directly to Israel's destruction as a nation and their assimilation with pagans. Never again would they be the people of God. In the end, even Egypt—the land from whence they had been redeemed would hold them in contempt (7:16).

### *Comment*

6:4–6 Once again in the book of Hosea the heart of the Lord is revealed as the reader is made privy to the inner deliberations of the infinite God. Despite the fact that he is the Creator who knows the end from the beginning, this depiction of God is intended to convey something true about his dealings with his people <span id="page-215-5"></span>when they sin against him. God's feelings toward Israel are analogous to exasperation toward a faithless spouse: "What shall I do with you?" One thing is certain: even when this people express their love toward God (cf. 6:1–3), he will not put any confidence in their words as long as their deeds betray him.

<span id="page-215-6"></span>"Your love [Hb. *hesed* ] is like a morning cloud," the Lord declares (v. 4). *Hesed*  denotes covenant loyalty or fidelity and thus is most often translated as "steadfast love" in the ESV (cf. v. 6). The trait of *hesed* is the opposite of Israel's spirit of whoredom; their interest in Yahweh lasts only a short time before they break his heart once again. The indictment of verse 4 is thus juxtaposed with the ending of verse 3: the Lord's refreshing goodness is like spring rain watering the earth, but their loyalty is like short-lived dew on the ground.

<span id="page-215-7"></span>In verse 5, the Lord speaks of the harm he will bring to Israel. He does this either to get their attention or to punish them, perhaps even as a final judgment against them. Sometimes he raises up powerful nations against them, who ravage them materially, and literally kill many. At other times he sends natural disasters, such as drought, to shake them up and break the hold of other gods over them. But he also "hews" and "slays" them through the words of the prophets.

<span id="page-215-3"></span>This is more than hyperbole. Jeremiah 1:9–10 claims that, by the word of the prophet, kingdoms rise and fall—they are established or they perish. God pronounces judgment against Israel through his spokesmen, and thus judgment is assured. Note the parallel drawn between the prophets and "the words of my mouth." True prophets speak the very words of God and carry as much weight and force as he does.

<span id="page-215-8"></span>God's judgment is like the sun, which dries up the morning mist, revealing Ephraim's true character. There are numerous areas of corruption in Israel. One is, of course, outright idolatry, worship of Baal and the Canaanite pantheon. Another is the perverted worship of Yahweh at the shrines of the golden calf in Bethel. Yet another is the ethical and moral behavior that renders all forms of worship loathsome to a holy God, even those performed in accordance with the instructions of his Word (Hos. 6:6). Without knowledge of God (a covenant term implying love; cf. 2:20) and steadfast love (*hesed* ), their religious activities are rejected. Their religion is empty, even if they think they are serving Yahweh. In their heart of hearts, they do not want a God who confronts them with their sin. This indictment is a theme throughout the prophets (e.g., Isa. 1:11–17; Amos 5:21).

<span id="page-215-10"></span><span id="page-215-9"></span><span id="page-215-4"></span><span id="page-215-2"></span><span id="page-215-1"></span><span id="page-215-0"></span>6:7–11 The word "Adam" (v. 7) is sometimes understood as a reference to a person, so that "transgressed the covenant" would refer to the action of Adam in Genesis 3. But the use of the word "there" in the second half of verse 7 suggests that a place is in view. "Like Adam" would thus mean "Like [they did at] Adam." The town of Adam was on the east bank of the Jordan River in Gilead, about one-third of the way north between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee, near the Jabbok tributary. It is mentioned in Joshua 3:16 as the place where the waters stood in a heap when the Jordan parted.

<span id="page-216-2"></span>"They transgressed the covenant" is more woodenly translated "they broke covenant," that is, they were treacherous against covenant faithfulness, which the Lord takes as an act of treachery against him. But what is the treachery to which he refers? Hosea 6:8–9 might provide the answer, if we understand verse 8 as referring to Adam—which was in the region of "Gilead"—as the "city of evildoers" and verse 9 as describing the act of evil committed there: priests murdering Israelites on their way to Shechem.21 This would indeed be treachery against the covenant under which Israel lived (Ex. 20:13).

<span id="page-216-3"></span><span id="page-216-0"></span>"Ephraim's whoredom" is in the "house of Israel"—defiling it like a brothel (Hos. 6:10). This is called a "horrible thing," an unthinkable evil, the ultimate revulsion: the house of God's people has become a bordello of idolatry.

This passage ends where it begins, with a passing reference to Judah. Verse 11 can be understood in two different ways. The declaration that a "harvest is appointed" may signal that a judgment awaits Judah as well. Those understanding the verse this way sometimes argue that the second half of the verse goes with 7:1: "When I restore the fortunes of my people [6:11b], when I would heal Israel [7:1a], . . ."

<span id="page-216-7"></span><span id="page-216-5"></span><span id="page-216-4"></span>Alternatively, both halves of 6:11 can be kept together and understood to highlight that, historically, Judah did not suffer the same fate as Israel; rather, a remnant was restored to continue on in covenant with the Lord. Thus the "harvest" would be a blessing, a restoration of fortunes, and the promise of such would be especially meaningful to the people of Judah during the exile.

<span id="page-216-8"></span><span id="page-216-1"></span>7:1–2 These verses contain the first of Hosea's five references to Samaria. Samaria was the capital city of Israel (1 Kings 16:29) and is probably in mind specifically when feminine imagery of God's people is used (Israel and Ephraim are usually portrayed as masculine).

<span id="page-216-6"></span>The picture of Israel here is characterized by unbridled preying on the vulnerable. To "heal" Israel would be to restore some measure of peace and prosperity to the land (Hos. 7:1). If and when God did this, Israel's alter ego, Ephraim, and their capital, Samaria, would merely use it as an opportunity to run wild. But their injustices perpetrated against one another, their lies and perjuries, their thievery and robbery, have all been committed before the face of God, even though they are not aware of it (v. 2). God "remembers" it, that is, he takes note of their evil acts and will do something about it.

<span id="page-216-11"></span><span id="page-216-10"></span><span id="page-216-9"></span>7:3–10 This passage is a parable of a baking oven. It is used here to describe wickedness occurring at a national level (vv. 3–7) and also at an international level (vv. 8–10).

<span id="page-216-12"></span>At the national level, the wickedness appears to center around assassination plots. To understand how the parable applies, it is helpful to note that, in ancient Israel, the type of oven described here would have had a fire inside of it, stoked until the oven was roaring hot. The oven would then have been sealed and its heat would have lasted for hours, with bread baking inside. This is a fitting parable from the perspective of what was going on in Hosea's day, as the faithless and wicked activities of the assassins burned continually and strongly, like the heat of an oven, "baking" their plots until they came to murderous fruition. Stated differently, a hot oven is a fitting image for aroused emotions of "regicidal fury."22 It is also a fitting parable from a linguistic perspective, since the Hebrew word for "baker" (v. 4) sounds like the words for "adulterer" (v. 4) and "anger" (v. 6).

<span id="page-217-6"></span><span id="page-217-5"></span><span id="page-217-4"></span>The word "adulterers" (v. 4) picks up the idea of being faithless to the covenant; the word is used elsewhere in Hosea in the context of idolatry (2:4; 4:13, 14) but perhaps here is used more generally to describe the wickedness of those plotting evil (cf. Jer. 9:2–3). The heat of their wickedness is strong, like the heat of an oven heated so hot that the baker no longer needs to fan the flame; it is hot enough to bake bread, just as the heat of those plotting evil is hot enough to fulfill their murderous plots.

<span id="page-217-7"></span>There is much debate concerning Hosea 7:5. The phrase "heat of wine" continues the metaphor of a baking oven, in this context applied figuratively to the heated drunkenness that results from drinking too much. It is less clear what the "day of our king" refers to, who it is that has "stretched out his hand with mockers," and what exactly that phrase means (it occurs only here in the Bible).

<span id="page-217-9"></span><span id="page-217-8"></span>There is also debate surrounding verses 6–7, although here the overall sense is perhaps clearer. With hearts stoked hot, the plotters draw near to their "intrigue" (or "ambush") (v. 6). They lie in wait, their passion burning blisteringly hot (v. 7). Their political leaders are consumed like fuel in the oven's fire (v. 7).

<span id="page-217-1"></span><span id="page-217-0"></span>Although one particular assassination may have been in mind originally, assassination in general had become the order of the day, encompassing the deaths of most kings of that era. King Zechariah did not call on the Lord. He ruled six months—it took that long for the "bread" (murderous plots) to "rise" against him. Shallum killed him and seized the throne (2 Kings 15:10). Shallum did not call on the Lord. It took only one month for the bread to rise against him. Menahem struck down Shallum in order to rule instead (2 Kings 15:14). Menahem did not call on the Lord. His son Pekahiah ruled after him (2 Kings 15:23). Pekahiah did not call on the Lord. It took two years for the bread to rise against him. Pekahiah's general, Pekah, assassinated him in a power grab (2 Kings 15:25). Thus, at a national level, red-hot wickedness led again and again to kings and rulers being consumed by violent men; during the entire time, no one called on the Lord for help.

<span id="page-217-10"></span><span id="page-217-3"></span><span id="page-217-2"></span>The parable of the oven is then applied to wickedness at an international level (Hos. 7:8–10). Here, Ephraim is "mixed" or "kneaded" among the nations (v. 8). As a baker kneads dough, Ephraim is blended (ethnically or spiritually) with various peoples so as never again to be distinguishable as the people of God. This is not even a judgment God imposed forcibly; they did it to themselves.

They have made themselves an unpalatable mess, like an unturned cake in the oven, one side burned and the other doughy. Despite this failure of cookery,

<sup>22</sup> Shalom Paul, "Image of the Oven and the Cake in Hosea 7:4–10," *VT* 18 (1968): 114–120.

<span id="page-218-5"></span>strangers (Assyria) devour any edible morsel (v. 9). It seems that Israel has made foreign alliances but is unaware of how destructive these alliances will be. This lack of awareness is emphasized by the next metaphor: "Gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knows it not," completely unaware of how weak he has become.

<span id="page-218-3"></span>Such weakness and judgment should have led Israel to return to the Lord and seek him, but pride prevented their doing so (v. 10). As in 5:5, such pride will lead to their downfall.

<span id="page-218-7"></span><span id="page-218-6"></span>7:11–16 These verses continue to describe the Lord's people foolishly looking to the nations for help instead of to the Lord, but the metaphor switches from that of a baking oven to that of a silly dove. Birdbrained Ephraim turns to Egypt instead of the Lord and thus is taken to Assyria (v. 11). The image is of a dove that comes foolishly to the ground for food, unaware of its surroundings, and is captured by a net. Historically, Assyria was the net with which God ensnared Israel—just as he said he would (v. 12; cf. 2 Kings 17:6).23

<span id="page-218-9"></span><span id="page-218-1"></span>God and his spouse suffer from an estranged relationship. Not only have his people wandered from the truth and rebelled; they also perpetrate lies about him (Hos. 7:13). These falsehoods in particular hold God's redemption at bay. Perhaps "lies" is a reference to the golden calves that were supposed to represent God, or to some other corrupted act of worship or wrongheaded belief. Perhaps they flow from the simple and common misunderstanding that God would save them if they followed some religious ritual and outwardly honored him without inwardly conforming to his ethical and moral requirements. Whatever it is, they have slandered their covenant partner and King.

<span id="page-218-10"></span><span id="page-218-0"></span>What is more, they refuse to call out to him in sincerity and truth (v. 14). Desperate for grain and wine, "they gash themselves," imitating the Canaanite method of praying (1 Kings 18:28), and thus rebel against the Lord. He had loved them and taught them as a parent does a child ("trained and strengthened their arms"; cf. Hos. 11:1), but they were utterly disloyal and rebellious (7:15).

<span id="page-218-12"></span><span id="page-218-11"></span><span id="page-218-2"></span>All along, Hosea has been declaring that the Israelites should "return" (*shub*) to the Lord. Here they do "return" (v. 16), but not to their God. They are like an unreliable bow, an image used elsewhere in the context of treachery, describing those who fail to do as they are supposed to (Ps. 78:57). Destruction will result, and their allies in Egypt will despise them for it. Yahweh, and Yahweh alone, could have saved them, but he is the one person on whom they refused to call.

### *Response*

<span id="page-218-4"></span>"What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah?" (Hos. 6:4). The same inner turmoil of the Lord is later echoed in 11:8: "How can I give you up, O Ephraim? . . . My heart recoils within me." This revelation of conflict within

<span id="page-218-8"></span><sup>23</sup> If the Hebrew text is maintained, the meaning of verse 12b is unclear. Others suggest emending the text to read, "I will punish them sevenfold for their evil" (Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 115–116), or, "I will chastise them according to the report of their treaties" (Andersen and Freedman, *Hosea*, 471). Certainty in translation is not possible here.

the heart of God is paradigmatic for the book of Hosea. His people put him in a bind; he is torn between two passions, justice and mercy. But the gospel is that this conflict has been resolved on the cross by Jesus, who willingly took the judgment his people earned so that a just God did not have to "give them up." It is this Jesus who came to reveal the Father, who desires compassion and mercy in his people.

<span id="page-219-0"></span>Some of the most well-respected religious leaders of Jesus' time, those who (in the people's eyes, at least) exemplified how to keep the law and please God, were the sect of the Pharisees. And yet, like the wayward people of God described in Hosea, these spiritual leaders did not sincerely understand or know the true and living God they purported to serve. Hosea 6:6 declares, "I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings." Jesus twice quoted this verse to the Pharisees and told them that they needed to comprehend what it meant.

<span id="page-219-4"></span><span id="page-219-3"></span>On one such occasion, Jesus reclined at table with unsavory members of society—tax collectors and other sinners. The spiritual elites did not understand how a prophet could be friendly with such people (Matt. 9:10–13). On another occasion, Jesus and his disciples were plucking grain to eat on the Sabbath, and the Pharisees condemned them for doing so (Matt. 12:1–8). Both times, Jesus quoted Hosea 6:6 to them, saying that if they had known its meaning, they would have understood his actions. The leaders Jesus rebuked did not grasp the character of God. They did not understand the meaning of righteousness. God desired steadfast love (*hesed* ) from the Pharisees, but all he found was hypocrisy.24 The Father desires mercy in his children. Disciples of Christ are those who, like him, reach out to the unsavory in mercy and bring them along into the fold. He desires not religiosity but love (*hesed* ). This is the proper response to the love of God we have so freely received in Jesus.

<span id="page-219-5"></span>Sadly, Israel did not respond to the Lord's love by showing faithful love toward him. In the parable of the oven, Ephraim had rendered itself indistinguishable from pagan peoples. They had so mixed themselves that they were unrecognizable as the people of God. God's people are always in danger of assimilation and must remind themselves in every generation of who they are. Jesus said that he would rather Christians be either cold or hot. But if they are lukewarm, he will spit them out (Rev. 3:15–16). This is similar to God's declaration that Israel was an unturned cake, half burnt and half uncooked (Hos. 7:8). God desires a people who know him and whose actions are motivated by love for him. Following his warning of spitting out lukewarm Christians, Jesus declares, "You say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked" (Rev. 3:17). His counsel is to be rich in good deeds and not distracted by earthly allurement (v. 18).

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-221-0"></span>"Set the trumpet to your lips!" (8:1) is another clarion call to pay attention and be alert, for the enemy is at the gate, swooping in against the house of the Lord like a bird of prey. Israel has assumed they were on good terms with their Maker, but this was self- deception. Far from being dependent on Yahweh as his faithful servants, they sanctioned kings who did not meet with his approval. Further, they set up idols, which he scorns. Israel put their trust in anything and everything except their one true God.

The difficulty with legitimate biblical faith is that the real God, the living Father of Israel, expects his people to respond in obedience to his gracious favor. Worshipers cannot autonomously ignore his commands forever and be blessed by him. Idols and false gods, on the other hand, do not require an inner change of heart. They do not demand a monogamous relationship. Why would they care how many other gods are worshiped? But Israel's Maker considers all other objects of faith to be rivals for the hearts and minds of his people and thus an evil influence, a source of spiritual adultery.

This includes not only worship of false gods but also looking to other nations for deliverance. These other "lovers" were for hire but were not actually beneficial to Ephraim. The tribute paid to them would ultimately be Israel's undoing. Not content with tribute, Assyria would soon move in and consume the entire kingdom in one gulp. The only savior for Israel, the only possible help, was this one God, who demands moral, ethical, and spiritual compliance. He would have them only on his own terms. But they were pathologically incapable of being faithful to him. They were convinced that salvation was to be found elsewhere—in palaces,

fortified cities, strongholds, political alliances, tribute, and golden calves. They were lost. "Set the trumpet to your lips!" Samaria's end has come.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-222-5"></span><span id="page-222-4"></span>8:1–4a The section begins by invoking an imagined scene of an enemy approaching the walls to besiege it (v. 1). The "trumpet" is thus to be blown in order to warn of an "ominous threat of impending destruction."25 The enemy is compared to a "vulture" (*nesher*), a word that may also be translated "eagle" (as the term is often rendered in the ESV).

<span id="page-222-9"></span>What is the "house of the Lord" (v. 1) in this context? The phrase seems to parallel "the land of the Lord" in 9:3–4. More specifically, Samaria is mentioned in the following verses, as are Israel and Ephraim—seemingly equating both the city of Samaria and the tribe of Ephraim with the northern kingdom. In short, the Lord will bring judgment against this land because they transgressed his covenant and rebelled against his law.

<span id="page-222-7"></span>Ironically, amid such faithlessness, the people claim to "know" the Lord (8:2); in the book of Hosea, this term implies faithful relationship. But they seem unaware of how deeply they have offended him and betrayed their relationship. In reality, Israel has "spurned," or "cast off," the "good" (v. 3), which may be a way of saying that they are disobedient and thus have given up the "good" that comes to the Lord's faithful people (cf. Deut. 6:24; 30:15), although the phrase could also be a reference to the Lord as "the good One." In either case, it suggests a rejection of the Lord and his ways, and for this reason the enemy will pursue Israel like a bird of prey.

<span id="page-222-8"></span><span id="page-222-3"></span><span id="page-222-2"></span><span id="page-222-1"></span><span id="page-222-0"></span>The people's spurning of God extends to their appointment of rulers (Hos. 8:4a). God was to determine who would be their king by appointing the first in a monarchic line. He chose Saul (1 Sam. 9:17), and later appointed David (1 Sam. 16:13). Even among the northern kings he was active, supporting such kings as Jehu (2 Kings 9:6). But in the dark days of assassination, opportunists were not interested in the choice of the living God. Violently seizing political power had nothing to do with justice or righteousness. And the people of Israel seemed to approve. They claimed to "know" God—that is, to acknowledge him as God (Hos. 8:2)—but their approval of such rulers pointed in the opposite direction, and the

<span id="page-222-6"></span><sup>25</sup> Robert D. Bergen, "Calling Forth Yahweh's Curses: Hosea's Judgment of Israel in 8:1–10:15," *CTR* 7 (1993): 42.

Lord makes this clear by stating that he "knew" not their rulers (v. 4)—that is, he did not acknowledge them as legitimate.

<span id="page-223-6"></span><span id="page-223-5"></span><span id="page-223-2"></span><span id="page-223-0"></span>8:4b–6 The people had taken the gold and silver from God (2:8) and made idols of them (8:4b), doing so "for their own destruction." This Hebrew idiom woodenly reads, "therefore, he will be cut off." The phrase "to be cut off" occurs regularly in the OT to describe the sanctions of the covenant (Ex. 31:14; Lev. 7:20; etc.). The verb "to cut" is also used to describe the making of a covenant (Hos. 2:18; 10:4), leading to a potential play on words: the covenant that was cut between Yahweh and Israel had been violated; thus, they will be cut off.

<span id="page-223-4"></span><span id="page-223-3"></span>Israel had "spurned" the good (8:3). Now the same verb is used in relation to Israel and the calf (v. 5). This is the first direct reference to a golden calf in the book of Hosea. Although it is not called "golden" here, it is immediately preceded by God's complaint that gold was used in the construction of idols like it.

There is some question concerning how to translate the phrase rendered "I have spurned your calf, O Samaria." The Hebrew is more woodenly translated, "He has spurned your calf, Samaria" (cf. ESV mg.), as if Hosea himself interjects his own comment. The Greek translation reads, "Get rid of your calf, Samaria!" Yet another option is, "Your calf has spurned you, Samaria." This last reading would, of course, be sarcasm. (It may be noted that "Samaria" here refers to the inhabitants of the land in general, not the city of Samaria in particular, as the calf was not located there; cf. 10:5.) In any case, it is clear that the legitimacy of their calf worship is being denied.

<span id="page-223-11"></span><span id="page-223-8"></span><span id="page-223-7"></span>Hosea's charge continues: Israel is "incapable of innocence" (8:5b). What will it take for this situation to change? Verse 6 may be an insight into the psychology of idolatry. As long as the image remains, it will influence the people in a certain way. The calf had become a universal psychosis: the people imagined that it represented God. They knew that a craftsman made it; they knew it was their own creation. But as long as it remained, they were unable to conceive of God apart from it—they could not be "innocent" before him. The only cure for this spiritual situation was to forcibly remove the idol. Thus, it will be "broken to pieces."

<span id="page-223-13"></span><span id="page-223-10"></span><span id="page-223-9"></span>8:7–10 Hosea next uses a series of metaphors to describe Israel. First, "They sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind" (v. 7). It is a biblical principle that a person reaps what he sows (Gal. 6:7). To "sow wind" is a picture of futility and folly; what can one hope to gain from a harvest of wind? In this context, the image appears to be a way of describing how Israel is playing international politics in vain hopes of security and prosperity. But instead of no harvest whatsoever, the sowing of wind yields a whirlwind, which refers elsewhere to God's judgment (Amos 1:14). For their foolish and rebellious actions, Israel will reap a crop of proverbial storm that blows the wicked away (Job 21:18; Prov. 10:25).

<span id="page-223-12"></span><span id="page-223-1"></span>The next metaphor also involves sowing, picturing planted grain that grows into a malformed stalk, with no edible part. This is an analogy for Israel: God planted and watered the nation, but when it came time for harvest, there was nothing worth <span id="page-224-1"></span>reaping. Isaiah 5:1–7 uses a similar image of Israel as a vineyard yielding only rancid grapes. But Hosea adds that, in the end, it does not matter if the stalks are nourishing; if they were, strangers would only devour them. In other words, nothing in Israel is worth having or wanting, but the little that is there will be taken away (Hos. 8:7b); the political actions Israel has taken to advantage itself have yielded nothing but delusion and loss. Israel has already been swallowed up by the nations (v. 8a). They are a "vessel" desired by none (v. 8b). The nation is fit only to be discarded.

<span id="page-224-5"></span><span id="page-224-4"></span><span id="page-224-3"></span><span id="page-224-0"></span>The people "have gone up to Assyria" (v. 9); that is, they seek help from a pagan nation instead of from the Lord. They are immediately compared to a "wild donkey wandering alone." As similar words in Hebrew, "Ephraim" and "donkey" form a pun; the word "donkey" is used elsewhere as a metaphor to describe those who are hostile to others and living apart from them (Gen. 16:12), which may be the sense here as well. They are alone on the international scene. This could also explain why they have "hired lovers" (Hos. 8:9); that is, why they have paid money for a political alliance with Assyria.

<span id="page-224-12"></span><span id="page-224-7"></span><span id="page-224-6"></span>Their alliance will do no good. No matter whom they hire, the Lord's judgment will come (v. 10). The word for "gather" occurs in the next chapter to refer to those gathered for punishment (9:6), and that understanding fits the context well here also. Their judgment will be the heavy tribute they must pay, causing their leaders to "writhe" in pain.26 In following a course of political alliances and cunning, trusting in their own resources ("hire allies among the nations"), Israel has squandered their substance.

<span id="page-224-9"></span><span id="page-224-8"></span>8:11–13 Ephraim will suffer this burden because they have multiplied "altars for sinning" (v. 11). The thought is repeated to emphasize rhetorically the multiplication. Altars are places of religious devotion and service. One might expect that they evince the people's desire to worship Yahweh, but Hosea calls them "altars for sinning" because God's people are worshiping false gods with them, because they have mixed the worship of the Lord with the worship of other gods, and/ or because they committed evil acts at them. Whatever the reason(s), everything about these altars is offensive to the Lord. The people's religious practices have led to condemnation, not forgiveness.

<span id="page-224-10"></span>Continuing the theme of multiplication, God says that if he were to multiply laws for his people, those laws would be reckoned "strange" (v. 12)—the same word used for the "strangers" who would devour Israel's strength (v. 7). Everything is upside down: Israel is dissolved into what is foreign and strange, so as to be indistinguishable as a people of God, yet if God were to speak to them with volumes and volumes of revelation, they would reckon that revelation as foreign and strange. His word has become alien to them.

<span id="page-224-11"></span>The result of their religion of sacrifices is that Yahweh will return (*shub*) them to Egypt (v. 13). This Hebrew verb is sometimes used in the sense of repentance, turning back to God (e.g., 2:7; 3:5; 5:4; 6:1; 7:10). It is a sad and tragic reversal that

<span id="page-224-2"></span><sup>26</sup> It is also possible to translate, "And they shall soon writhe because of the tribute of the king of princes," that is, because of the tribute imposed upon them by the king of Assyria. The endpoint is the same.

a verb of restoration is used here to convey the opposite result: they will "return" to Egypt, to the land of bondage and harsh servitude. The altars for sinning that they serve with endless religious zeal and ritual will serve only to remind God of their offense until they are banished forever—fulfilling the worst and final aspect of the covenant curses (Deut. 28:68).

<span id="page-225-0"></span>Of course, Egypt would not be the literal place of their exile; the northern tribes were removed to Assyria. Later, the southern kingdom was exiled to Babylon. The name "Egypt" speaks to the character of that banishment: it turns the clock back to the time before the honeymoon between God and Israel, when he rescued her from Egypt (Hos. 2:15). It will be as if they were never his covenant people at all.

<span id="page-225-6"></span><span id="page-225-1"></span>8:14 The section ends with a summary that includes Judah in its scope. In place of their Maker, Israel and Judah have made temples and fortified cities, which provide a false sense of security. But Israel and Judah are not allowed a secular existence. God chose them to play out the history of redemption, to illustrate to the world what a relationship with the living God is like. Thus, the palaces, temples, fortified cities, and strongholds must go, just as surely as the golden calf must go. They have a spiritual grip on the hearts and minds of Yahweh's people, and a jealous God will brook no rivals.

The occasional references to Judah must have helped later Judeans to adopt and own the message of Hosea for themselves. Although almost all of specific complaints and judgments and expressions of affection in the book are directed to Israel/Ephraim, Judah's relationship is governed by the same equation of fidelity and law, and thus the principles expressed in Hosea apply equally to the south.

#### *Response*

Israel did not know the real God, yet they deluded themselves into thinking that he was pleased with them. The real God had revealed himself through his laws (and, of course, in other ways as well). They should have known better. But, because they became worthless to him, God determined that they would cease to exist as a people.

Hosea's generation models anti-repentance. Yahweh had brought an earlier generation out of Egypt. This was salvation for them, and in this they were a picture of the greater salvation Christians experience in Christ. But the judgment on Hosea's generation was that as a nation they would revert to their pre-saved state. They typify those who have felt in some way the graces of salvation and yet fall away, making impossible any return to saving faith (Heb. 6:1–8).

<span id="page-225-7"></span><span id="page-225-5"></span><span id="page-225-2"></span>The text is clear that Israel thought of themselves as very religious. Their cry was mimicked by Yahweh: "My God, we—Israel—know you" (Hos. 8:2). They multiplied altars (v. 13). The prophet has to point out to them that the calf of Samaria was not in fact God (v. 6), yet they thought they were worshiping something real, someone who was pleased with them.

<span id="page-225-4"></span><span id="page-225-3"></span>The true and living God was not impressed with their religiosity. In fact, he was disgusted with it. In the eyes of God, they ignored him (v. 4) and spurned what was <span id="page-226-2"></span><span id="page-226-0"></span>actually good (v. 3). They forgot who their Maker really was (v. 14). They became incapable of knowing him. Even if God were to have revealed tens of thousands of laws, they would not have been moved from their willful ignorance (v. 12). Because of this, they no longer had a unique relationship with God, and thus they were lost.

Like Hosea, Jesus also speaks of the coming judgment for those who are outwardly religious but do not really know the Lord:

Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?" And then will I declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness." (Matt. 7:21–23)

<span id="page-226-5"></span><span id="page-226-1"></span>"Lord, Lord" seems to be the new mantra of self-deceptive religion. It is possible to give Jesus lip service just as surely as it was possible for OT Israel to put its faith in the outward trappings of faith. But without inner conformity to the values of Christ's kingdom, without a transformed heart and a new birth, one's religion is so many altars of sin (Hos. 8:11). What Jesus calls for is a faith that acknowledges him, and him alone, as King—and serves him with joyful and wholehearted obedience. This is the natural response to a King who has saved us in his matchless power and unspeakably great love.

<span id="page-226-4"></span><span id="page-226-3"></span>Samaria—and later, Jerusalem—experienced the final judgment ahead of time in order to foreshadow the end of the world. The prophet's work was to call them to the way of escape from this judgment. Some suggest it is Hosea the prophet who is called by God to blow the trumpet.27 After all, Hosea teaches that prophets are watchmen, commissioned to warn the people (9:8). Today, Christians also proclaim to the world the way of salvation, laboring at this mission until Jesus returns.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-228-1"></span>This section continues the theme of exile for the people of God because of spiritual adultery. Here, Hosea reiterates that Israel is headed for ultimate ruin; in other words, they will be removed from the Promised Land, and their relationship with God will be severed (9:3). He treats their sin as a historic pattern, going back to the days of Gibeah (v. 9). Then Yahweh joins in and argues that he knew something was wrong as far back as the incident at Baal-Peor (v. 10). The judgment on Israel is specifically a failure of fecundity: they will have no progeny. Theirs will be the last generation.

<span id="page-228-3"></span><span id="page-228-2"></span>As shown in table 2.1, two loosely parallel halves can be discerned within the scope of 9:10–17.

<span id="page-228-11"></span><span id="page-228-7"></span>The message is repeated for emphasis. In an attempt to ensure fertility, they had turned to Baal and the Canaanite cult. This will fail them. God will not allow them to be the people of Baal. If they will not be Yahweh's people, they will be no people at all.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-229-5"></span><span id="page-229-4"></span><span id="page-229-3"></span>9:1–2 Having left their one true lover, Israel—whom God still calls "my people" beds every available god and pagan nation (v. 1). Hosea calls on them to stop reveling in the abundance they have enjoyed from their harvest, since the threshing floors, their corn and wine, will not "feed" them (v. 2). They live at the Lord's mercy, and he will soon cause their abundance to disappear.

<span id="page-229-6"></span><span id="page-229-1"></span>9:3–6 In light of such unfaithfulness, the Israelites "shall not remain in the land of the Lord" (v. 3), which was not to be defiled by such wickedness (Lev. 18:24–30). Because they failed to "return" to the Lord (again the verb *shub*, which implies repentance), they will "return" to Egypt—as if they had never left or come to know the Lord. It is a punishment that fits the crime. The same is true with regard to eating "unclean food in Assyria": by failing to be people of purity in the Lord's land, they will be exiled to a land in which they will be forced to eat impure food, becoming just like the nations in their diets (as they had become in their practices as well). Their addiction to deviancy renders them despicable to their divine husband, and he will annul his union with them.

<span id="page-229-7"></span>Nothing they will do in exile will relate to Yahweh (Hos. 9:4). None of the practices they were able to perform to the service of the God who brought them out of Egypt will be allowed. They will not pour out drink offerings for him. They will eat bread because they are hungry, but none will be reserved for "the house of the Lord." Yahweh's "house" (v. 4) could be a reference to the "land of the Lord" (v. 3) or to a religious center in it—the shrine in Bethel, for example. The point is that they will be unable to enjoy whatever "appointed festival" or feast days that previously connected them to God (v. 5). Their end is damnation. They will die unredeemed and be buried in a foreign land devoid of Yahweh (v. 6). The Lord had once saved them from Pharaoh, but now he will give them back to an oppressor, and nature—nettles and thorns—will destroy their property in judgment (v. 6; cf. Isa. 5:6; 7:23–25).

<span id="page-229-12"></span><span id="page-229-11"></span><span id="page-229-10"></span><span id="page-229-9"></span><span id="page-229-8"></span><span id="page-229-2"></span>9:7–9 Hosea proclaims that the "days of punishment have come"—judgment is imminent; the time for repentance is now or never (v. 7a). And what of Israel's response? The text momentarily gives voice to the rebellious people: they accuse Hosea of being out of his mind and at odds with the community (v. 7b). They call him mad.28 They seem to be accusing Hosea of great hatred toward them, and of great sin.

<span id="page-229-13"></span>Prophets are supposed to be watchmen, ready to warn of danger at the behest of God (v. 8). But the people would not listen. Their enmity ("hatred") toward their God and his prophet in the land caused their "ways" to be so ensnared that it is the people of Israel who are revealed in the end as fools and madmen, for they are the ones who embraced a misleading spirit.29

<span id="page-229-14"></span><span id="page-229-0"></span>The word translated "corrupt" (v. 9) first appears in Scripture at Genesis 6:11–13, where we read that the world was corrupt and filled with violence. The

<span id="page-230-3"></span><span id="page-230-2"></span>corruption Hosea mentions is that of Gibeah. Perhaps Hosea alludes to Judges 19– 21, where we read that the Gibean citizenry gang-raped a Levite's concubine to death (Judges 19). The rest of the tribes (except for Benjamin) gathered to bring judgment against the people of Gibeah for this great wrong. Here it is the Lord who will remember the great wrongs the Israelites of Hosea's day have committed and will punish them for their sins.

<span id="page-230-9"></span><span id="page-230-7"></span>9:10–12 The identity of the speaker shifts from Hosea to Yahweh, who speaks again in the first person. God remembers Israel when they first met: she was like a savory, delicious, attractive vine in the desert. Rescuing her was like finding the first fig of the season (v. 10a). His relationship to the previous generation was fondly remembered, as they went together through the wilderness. He was their one God, and they were his people.

<span id="page-230-8"></span><span id="page-230-5"></span><span id="page-230-0"></span>But this monogamous harmony was disrupted when Israel went to the Baal of Peor (the "thing of shame"; v. 10b). Like Hosea's citation of Gibeah, Yahweh now reminisces about an even earlier event. While still led by Moses, Israel encountered Moabites and joined in worship of their god, Baal of Peor (Num. 25:1–3). This took place in Shittim (cf. comment on Hos. 5:1–2). Israel easily and eagerly abandoned the covenant between themselves and Yahweh there, and since that time, says the Lord (9:10), things have never been the same between them. They became as ugly as the thing they loved.

<span id="page-230-10"></span><span id="page-230-6"></span>Thus Ephraim's "glory" will "fly away like a bird" (v. 11). Their glory in this case is primarily their progeny: they will be left childless. This is a fitting judgment, since Baal was credited with, among other things, fertility. They sow to Baal for fecundity, but they reap childlessness. Whatever children they do have will be taken through violence (v. 12). They will die off as a people. If they will not be the people of God, they will be no people at all.

<span id="page-230-13"></span><span id="page-230-12"></span><span id="page-230-11"></span>9:13–17 Verse 13 is difficult. Most commentators follow the ancient Greek translation or assume a transmission error and reword it. McComiskey translates, "Just as I have chosen [judgment] for Tyre, planted in [its] place, so [I have chosen for] Ephraim to lead forth its sons to the murderer"30 (cf. ESV mg.). However the verse is intended, the judgment is clear: the present generation of Ephraim is the final generation.

<span id="page-230-15"></span><span id="page-230-14"></span><span id="page-230-4"></span>Apparently the prophet interjects a prayer in verse 14, asking the Lord to indeed bring the people to an end. The Lord's speech then resumes. Having mentioned their faithlessness at one place in the past (Baal-Peor; v. 10), he now mentions their sin somewhere else in the present: at Gilgal (v. 15), which has already been identified in Hosea with illicit worship (4:15). Their evil is so great that it has led the Lord to "hate" them, a word used elsewhere to describe the attitude of a husband seeking divorce (Deut. 22:13; 24:3), not necessarily because visceral hatred is involved but because he rejects his wife. The point is that God will no longer

<span id="page-230-1"></span><sup>30</sup> Thomas Edward McComiskey, "Hos 9:13 and the Integrity of the Masoretic Tradition in the Prophecy of Hosea," *JETS* 33/2 (1990): 159.

<span id="page-231-2"></span>show his love to Israel. Like a wife he is divorcing, he will "drive them out" of his "house" (the land; cf. Hos. 8:1). He also makes clear that some of the blame rests with Israel's leaders, those who should have been leading them in righteousness but in reality were leading them to rebellion.

<span id="page-231-6"></span>Israel's Lord repeats: whatever children they manage to bear will be killed (9:16). This is the last generation of Israel. Their time is up. It's over.

<span id="page-231-7"></span>Finally, Hosea again clarifies (v. 17). Although not every last child will be killed, and the population will not be completely exterminated, they will be integrated with the nations and will aimlessly wander, banished from the land of Yahweh. They will be lost, as good as dead.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-231-4"></span><span id="page-231-0"></span>God says that Israel has become "detestable like the thing they loved" (Hos. 9:10). Fixating upon something other than the true and living God, organizing one's life around it, will change a person until he or she resembles that thing, that idol. Psalm 115:4–8 (cf. 135:15–18) details how idols are deaf, dumb, blind, immobile, and inanimate. The passage then concludes, "Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them" (Ps. 115:8). From a spiritual perspective, idolaters become as lifeless and impotent as what they serve. This is a strong call and warning to turn from putting our hope in the things of this world to instead placing it in the true and living God.

<span id="page-231-9"></span><span id="page-231-8"></span><span id="page-231-3"></span><span id="page-231-1"></span>When Hosea preached against idolatry, he was mocked for it (cf. Hos. 9:7). Jesus warns that the same will be true for those who are faithful to his word (Matt. 5:11), and Paul explains that "The word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing" (1 Cor. 1:18). But just as Hosea was faithful to the word of the Lord, so too must we be faithful. The apostle Peter reminds Christians, "If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. . . . Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name" (1 Pet. 4:14, 16).

<span id="page-231-12"></span><span id="page-231-11"></span><span id="page-231-10"></span><span id="page-231-5"></span>Hosea 9 ends with a sober warning: Israel's continual refusal to repent of their wicked ways will lead to their rejection as the Lord's people (vv. 10–17). Whether in the OT, as here, or in the NT, as in Hebrews 3–4, the Lord consistently warns that those who continue in full-hearted rebellion and sin should not think of themselves as the people of God who will one day inherit the covenant promises. The Promised Land—whether Canaan or the new heavens and new earth—is not for apostates. For this reason, Christians are commanded to "exhort one another every day" (Heb. 3:13), reminding one another that we follow a faithful High Priest and Savior, Jesus, the one who will lead us finally and safely into God's blessed Promised Land of rest.

## HOSEA 10:1–15

- <span id="page-232-0"></span>10 Israel is a luxuriant vine that yields its fruit. The more his fruit increased, the more altars he built; as his country improved, he improved his pillars. **<sup>2</sup>** Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-233-5"></span><span id="page-233-4"></span><span id="page-233-2"></span>Hosea 10:1–8 is a third-person speech sandwiched between two first-person soliloquies, forming one unit of text (9:17 looks both forward and backward, serving to unite the previous unit with this one). The center of the speech seems to be 10:5–6, which speaks of the golden calf being plundered and taken to Assyria in exile and the people who worshiped it suffering tremendous judgment. This core material is framed by prophecies concerning kings (vv. 3–4, 7), which are likewise enclosed by condemnations of doomed high places and altars (vv. 1b–2, 8a).31 In the opening line, Israel is productive, but the more prosperous they become, the deeper they pursue false religion (v. 1). Thus in the closing line Israel in despair cries to the mountains to fall on them (v. 8).

<span id="page-233-6"></span><span id="page-233-3"></span><span id="page-233-1"></span><span id="page-233-0"></span>After Hosea's speech, the Lord brings up (again) the sin of Gibeah (recorded in Judges 19) (Hos. 10:9–11). That event is paradigmatic for the nation. They have misbehaved but up to now have been spared the full consequences for their actions. However, the time has now come for Ephraim (and Judah) to be spared no longer; they will be disciplined severely as the nations gather against them in judgment.

<sup>31</sup> Leeuwen, "Meaning and Structure of Hosea X 1–8," 377.

The prophet then takes up his burden again and calls upon his kinsmen to turn to Yahweh (vv. 12–15). If they do not begin to live differently, a terrible end is inevitable, including judgment on their children. The house of the golden calf is an ever-present offense before the living God.

## *Comment*

10:1–8 Although there is some question concerning the first half of verse 1,32 the second half is clear: Israel's advancement in prosperity has only furthered their crimes. The more they harvested, the more they built altars for illicit worship; the more the country improved, the more they improved their sacred stones ("pillars") for idolatry.

<span id="page-234-3"></span>Their lifestyle was oriented toward false worship, and it seems there is no motivation to change. "Their heart is false" (v. 2), so God must annihilate what is the product of, and the sustaining force for, their waywardness: the altars and other cultic objects.

The king whom they denounce, do not fear, and dismiss (v. 3) is perhaps Yahweh.33 To paraphrase, "Yahweh is not our king. We do not fear him; as for this King—he would do nothing for us anyway." The Hebrew in verse 3 is definite: "the king"; that is, a specific king is at issue. One may be reminded of the Jews' assertion to Pilate, "We have no king but Caesar" (John 19:15).

<span id="page-234-9"></span><span id="page-234-4"></span>Alternatively, the spurned king of Hosea 10:3 could be the Israelite king as he would be perceived after judgment had fallen and the people exiled. Hosea articulates their imagined speech, perhaps envisioning the thoughts of a people who wake up too late to their true situation. From a foreign land they will recognize that they should have feared the Lord.

<span id="page-234-5"></span>Verse 4 describes different types of faithless behavior. While it is debated whether it is the kings or the people who are being described, the type of behavior is generally clear. The verse begins by describing sin committed with the mouth and concludes by describing sin committed in acts of justice, acts that should have been righteous but in fact have been so wicked that they are more like poisonous weeds (cf. Amos 5:7; 6:12).

<span id="page-234-8"></span><span id="page-234-6"></span><span id="page-234-0"></span>Hosea 10:5 returns to the theme of idolatry, mentioning "the calf of Beth-aven," that is, the golden calf set up by Jeroboam (cf. comment on 4:15–16). This false god, which they considered glorious, will in fact be taken from them into exile by

<sup>32</sup> Most modern translations read "luxuriant vine," following the Greek as well as the meaning of an Arabic word built on the same root. Normally the Hebrew term means "to empty, lay waste, disturb," although this does not seem to fit the context well.

<span id="page-235-4"></span><span id="page-235-3"></span><span id="page-235-1"></span>Assyria (v. 6a; for "the great king," cf. comment on 5:10–13 [at v. 13]). There is no glory in other gods, and those who put their hope in them do not experience glory but only shame (v. 6b). Samaria's king will perish (v. 7) and their cultic centers will be destroyed, becoming wastelands filled only with thorn and thistle (v. 8a). So thorough will be the destruction that Israel will cry out for the mountains to bury them (v. 8b). Death would be preferable to the intense judgment to be unleashed on them.

<span id="page-235-7"></span><span id="page-235-6"></span><span id="page-235-5"></span><span id="page-235-2"></span><span id="page-235-0"></span>10:9–11 Yahweh now resumes his denunciation, again referencing Gibeah (v. 9; cf. comment on 9:7–9). The last part of 10:9 probably refers to the unjust Benjaminites and the terrible judgment that befell them (Judges 20; cf., again, comment on Hos. 9:7–9). Yahweh cites this as a warning that a similar "war against the unjust" is coming; although it has not yet ruined them, it soon will. Perhaps 10:10 continues to reference this war: as the tribes of Israel gathered at God's behest against the original perpetrators in Judges 20, so will the "nations" do the same in order to subject Israel to God's discipline and punishment. The term "double iniquity" (Hos. 10:10) is debated; some suggest that it refers to sins in the past and present or to two different idols worshiped by Israel, or that it is a general way to emphasize the depth of Israel's sin.

<span id="page-235-9"></span><span id="page-235-8"></span>In an earlier and happier time, Ephraim was a domesticated heifer (v. 11), working in harmony with its owner. But now both Ephraim and Judah need stricter discipline (a "yoke"; v. 11).

<span id="page-235-11"></span><span id="page-235-10"></span>10:12–15 Here once again the prophet picks up where Yahweh left off. He calls upon his people to heed the words of the Lord and believe, redeploying agricultural metaphors in new ways. Hosea calls them to sow not literal seed for a harvest of grain but "righteousness"—fidelity to the law, wholehearted love for the God of Israel (v. 12). To sow righteousness is to reap "steadfast love"—in Hebrew, *hesed*, covenanted loyalty or fidelity. The difficult task of breaking up fallow ground symbolizes whatever social change is required to produce a society characterized by righteousness and integrity toward Yahweh.

The prophet urges the people to seek the Lord until he responds by blessing their repentance; he will "rain righteousness upon you." The prophet is perhaps employing a pun, as the Hebrew verb "to rain" can also mean "to teach." To "rain righteousness" may be, in reality, to "teach" or instruct the people in the ways of the law. A way out of their predicament is thus suggested: as they seek the Lord and his righteousness, Yahweh will cooperate with that effort and move it along.

Hosea then reviews the sad reality of Israel's recent history up to this point, as well as the consequences that will follow if they do not turn. In strong contrast to verse 12, Israel has "plowed iniquity" (not "righteousness") and "thus reaped injustice" (not "steadfast love") (v. 13). Their only harvest has been "the fruit of lies," that is, the consequences of their disastrous national agenda. For example, they have placed their trust in their "own way." They have trusted that the size of their army would suffice. They have undervalued the God of their fathers while overestimating their own strength.

<span id="page-236-4"></span>As a result, their military power will inevitably be overrun (v. 14). They have trusted in fortresses just as surely as they trusted in the golden calf—and thus the fortresses have to go. Hosea refers to an event not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible—but surely known to his audience—as a historical template for Israel's vulnerability ("as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel"). What is clear is that the same Hebrew word for "destroy" used in verse 2 in reference to the sacred pillars is used in verse 14 to refer to their fortresses: as the calf was defaced and then carried away, so their strongholds will be breached and atrocities allowed. To trust in fortresses in place of God is to leave one's own infants without protection (v. 14b).

<span id="page-236-6"></span><span id="page-236-5"></span>The center of the problem is located in Bethel (v. 15), the house of the golden calf, the central lie that Israel has internalized, the binding force of their whole alternative religion. The king who patronizes this noxious cult will be "utterly cut off."

### *Response*

Consider the insights concerning idolatry revealed in this chapter. This topic has far-reaching spiritual and psychological ramifications, deeply and profoundly applicable to Christians in the twenty-first century. People's basic motivations and faith commitments have not changed in character over the millennia; the same way of thinking at work in ancient Israel still moves hearts today.

At first, idolatry seems limited to cultic objects: golden calves, altars, and sacred pillars. Of course no Christian, nor most non-Christians, in Western society has ever participated in this sort of religion. But the plethora of self-deceptions goes far beyond mere stone and wood totems. The true test of what a person believes is seen in what he trusts, in what he finds to be his refuge, security, or hope. What is believed to protect the future? What is necessary to be acceptable and at peace? It is here that modern civilization overlaps the ancient world.

<span id="page-236-3"></span><span id="page-236-0"></span>Israel's functional theology is seen in what they trusted. This is not the religion they would have confessed, but it is nevertheless what motivated them. They "trusted" in their "own way" (v. 13). This is reminiscent of the story of Gibeah in Judges 19–21. There, Israel at first did as God instructed in upholding the cause of the victim. But soon they stopped inquiring of God, and as he dropped out of their reckoning their actions went further and further afield, resulting in atrocities even greater than the original offense. A sense of autonomy—of being sufficient in oneself to follow one's own agenda and live by one's own rules—is clearly on display in that narrative.

<span id="page-236-2"></span><span id="page-236-1"></span>Of course, nothing could be more modern than such an attitude. Autonomy from religion—and thus from God—in one's calculations is as natural today as it was for the wayward Israelites. But trusting in oneself has grave consequences. To trust in oneself is to behave as if one had the authority of God; hence the crooked, counterfeit "justice" meted out in Judges 20–21, and also the injustice and iniquity characterizing Israel in Hosea 10. The list of atrocities committed in modern times in the name of atheistic and fascist ideologies need hardly be cataloged here. But

a sense of autonomy from God's moral code has led to unbridled iniquity among the citizenry in every nation that embraces secular humanism. This is the motto of trusting in the self: "I can do anything I want; no God will judge me; I am my own law."

<span id="page-237-3"></span>However, trusting oneself proves to be a false hope. Hosea connects this attitude with shame and loss, finally issuing in a previously self-confident people's crying to the hills to fall on and cover them (10:6, 8). Trusting in oneself leads in the end to despair. The job is too difficult. The task is too great. The sense of being overwhelmed feels like being a twig on the water, helplessly carried into the unknown (v. 7).

<span id="page-237-4"></span>The Israelites also placed their trust in military strength. This likewise characterizes the modern age. Their naive hope in strongholds and numbers of warriors would later fail them, resulting in loss, atrocity, and ruin, says Hosea.

<span id="page-237-1"></span>Israel had taken the fruit of the land, its overflowing produce, and put it to the service of a strange cult (v. 1). To what do people lend the fruits of their labor today? To know what a person spends much money on is to know what that person worships. An idolater invests in his idol. A nation of idolaters supports with their substance the national idol.

<span id="page-237-2"></span>Israel mourned because her national hope had lost its luster (v. 5). Her existence became characterized by fear, shame, hardship, ruin, and separation. Having repudiated Yahweh, Israel substituted for him by making worthless treaties. Utter despair is the natural consequence of losing one's religion. When one's object of trust fails, one is left without recourse.

<span id="page-237-7"></span><span id="page-237-0"></span>The obvious challenge of Hosea 10 is to consider in what way one's own inner assumptions and unexamined motivations are out of accord with the faith that one confesses. Jesus said that one cannot serve both God and money (Luke 16:13). What rules our hearts? Greed? The respect or love of others? Trust in our own abilities and competencies? Whatever it is, it is in competition with the gospel of Jesus and will eventually create a spiritual conflict in our lives.

<span id="page-237-8"></span><span id="page-237-6"></span><span id="page-237-5"></span>The alternative that Hosea presents is to seek God and sow what is right in his sight. "Break up your fallow ground" (Hos. 10:12), and he will shower us with knowledge of how to live rightly before him. This happens today as we heed the call of Jesus to take his yoke upon us and to learn from him, the one who is gentle and lowly in heart, the one who can give us true rest for our souls (Matt. 11:29) and who fills us with the fruit of righteousness, to the glory and praise of God (Phil. 1:11).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-239-10"></span><span id="page-239-3"></span><span id="page-239-2"></span>The great corpus of chapters 4–11 began with the call to "Hear the word of the Lord" (Hos. 4:1) and ends with the statement, "declares the Lord" (11:11). It climaxes with this section, where God's heart is once again revealed clearly. He is emotionally bound to this wayward people and is of two minds about them.

This material "is as tender as any in the Bible"—its intimacy is almost maternal.34 "Hosea 11:1–11 gives as clear and personal [a] picture into the heart of God as any illustration in all of Scripture."35 God loved Ephraim, adopted him, taught him to walk, held him in his arms, healed him, bound himself to him with "cords of kindness," bent down to feed him (vv. 1–4). One could not ask for a more attentive parent. He really loved his boy.

The next two sections address the immediate future situation and God's ambivalence. First, once again God expresses his disappointment and righteous indignation against his people (vv. 5–7). But then, almost miraculously, he reveals how this hurts him more than it does them (vv. 8–9). Yahweh is inwardly conflicted. Israel has offended him to the point that he desires to reject them forever. He wants to punish. He wants to get their attention by whatever harsh means are necessary. But in the end, he just cannot bring himself to do it.

This leads to the final portion of this section of Hosea, which looks to the more distant future (vv. 10–11). With almost rose-colored glasses, in a deeply emotional mood, Hosea envisions the people's return when God roars at them like a lion. They will hear Yahweh's too-deep-for-words utterance and will come trembling to him. The final thought of this great corpus is the Lord's declaration, "I will return them to their homes" (v. 11). God and prophet recognize that Israel's story will have a happy ending after all.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-239-1"></span><span id="page-239-0"></span>11:1–4 God picks up the narrative and again speaks in the first person. "Loved" and "called" (v. 1) is the language of election (Deut. 7:6–8): God is again reminiscing on the early days, when Israel was called from Egypt (Hos. 2:15). But amid this expression of parental affection, recalling Ephraim's infancy and toddler days (11:3–4), a seemingly out-of-place verse is found (v. 2). If this verse were before or after this section, it would not convey the same degree of dissonance and tension.

<span id="page-239-6"></span><sup>34</sup> Frederick Gaiser, "Preaching God: Hosea 11:1–11," *WW* 28/2 (2008): 204.

<sup>35</sup> Richard Lloyd and Debbie Lloyd, "An Example of the Shared Praxis Model Based on Hosea 11:1–11," *RevExp* 107/2 (2010): 239.

But right in the middle of God's looking, as it were, through the photo album of Ephraim's preschooler days, his eyes shining with sentiment, is an ugly and alien verse that mars the loving memories. Israel's response to Yahweh, even back then, was to spurn him and favor Baals and idols.

God is describing the past fully; he is not romanticizing it. From the beginning, Israel was not content with him. Their original sin was that in their hearts they never left Egypt. They did not realize who had "healed" them. All of Yahweh's gifts (including redemption), all of his provision, all of his providential care and pledged love had never moved them to want him.

<span id="page-240-3"></span><span id="page-240-2"></span>11:5–7 While some understand the opening line of verse 5 as declaring that Ephraim will return to Egypt (cf. ESV mg.), the ESV's translation makes perfect sense: Israel will not go back to literal Egypt but will be oppressed in Assyria. This is in full agreement with the idea of 8:13.

<span id="page-240-1"></span><span id="page-240-0"></span>The mood of 11:1–4, despite the discordant verse 2, was positive. In this section, that radically changes. Suddenly, the Lord vents his anger and exasperation, as if he has experienced a sudden shift in emotion. This is part of the imagery of Hosea: the theology that explores God's relationship with his people is communicated using the imagery of a parent at the end of his rope. The time has come for severance and dissolution of the relationship. If Israel will not *act* like the people of God, then they will not *be* the people of God. Let them be disinherited! Give them to the Assyrian king, who will conquer them in terrifying war (v. 6)!

<span id="page-240-5"></span><span id="page-240-4"></span>"Returning/turning" (*shub*) is a leading motif in this section, repeated in various forms three times in three verses. Israel will return not to Egypt but to Assyria (v. 5), for they refused to return to the Lord (v. 5); they are bent on turning away from him (v. 7). Verse 7 presents special difficulties; Ritschl calls it "untranslatable."36 Speiser suggests that the sense of the first few words is something like, "My people are addicted to turning away from me."37 Perhaps the verse continues with this thought: "Together, they call him to the One on high; he will not exalt him." Paraphrased, "Together, the prophets call Ephraim to Yahweh, but Ephraim will not exalt him." Whatever the precise meaning, the overall message is very clear: Israel and God have become irreconcilably estranged.

<span id="page-240-7"></span>11:8–9 Once again God's emotional state abruptly and enormously shifts. Having stated his intended purpose, having served notice, the Lord now has second thoughts. This is imagery drawn from the psychological state of a grieving father, who loves his deviant son even while recognizing that his antisocial behavior requires a just and definitive response. "How can I give you up?" God asks himself (v. 8). "How can I hand you over?" Although justice seems to demand it, the tender heart of God, who remembers Ephraim as an infant and a toddler, seeks another way.

<span id="page-241-2"></span><span id="page-241-1"></span><span id="page-241-0"></span>The cities of Admah and Zeboiim are listed in Genesis 14:2 along with the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their mention in this verse is perhaps a way of saying, "How can I destroy you as I did Sodom and Gomorrah?" These cities were "overthrown" (Gen. 19:25)—the very word used in Hosea 11:8 ("recoils") to speak of God's heart. The verb is used in Jonah's oracle that Nineveh would be "overthrown" (Jonah 3:4), and also in Lamentations 1:20: "My heart is wrung within me." The sense is that God is inwardly conflicted; Israel has put him in a double bind. He is a loving parent whose son has committed a terrible and unforgivable crime. This metaphor conveys something true about how the holy God relates to his criminal and reprobate children.

<span id="page-241-6"></span>The end result of God's inner dialogue is that he has decided—at least for the moment—not to unleash on Israel the full wrath they deserve. Judgments he has determined against them will not fall. Why? Because he is holy (Hos. 11:9), utterly distinct, and thus—unlike humanity—does not simply act out his anger in mean and vindictive ways. He is both a God who has strong emotions and a God who is not ruled by them. He will not simply come and unleash his "wrath" in uncontrollable anger.

<span id="page-241-7"></span>11:10–11 Inspired by Yahweh's speech, Hosea exults in a vision of God's roaring like a lion and the sons of Israel's trembling like birds, returning to the Promised Land from Egypt and Assyria. From wherever God's people will be scattered, Hosea envisions their return.

<span id="page-241-3"></span>The book opened with the fact that Israel had whored "from after" Yahweh (1:2 AT), but here they will "walk after" him (AT). In the eschatological future, in the climax of history, the people of God will do what they should have done all along.

<span id="page-241-4"></span>Finally, Yahweh himself closes the great corpus of chapters 4–11 with the promise, "I will return them to their homes." Instead of destroying them, he will chastise and discipline them until they learn to fear and love him. Then he will call them home.

## *Response*

Early in its history, Israel had for centuries been in bondage in Egypt for no fault of its own. The people originally went down to Egypt as a means of salvation from starvation, God having graciously sent Joseph ahead of them to prepare the way. They were not there as punishment for any sin. They were unjustly enslaved and mistreated, but God identified them as his son, those who inherited the covenant promises made to Abraham, and called them up out of Egypt (11:1).

<span id="page-241-8"></span><span id="page-241-5"></span>Many years later, Jesus would be taken as a young child down to Egypt in order to escape the murderous intentions of King Herod. After relating how Herod died and the Lord told the parents of Jesus to come home, it is this very verse that Matthew quotes and applies to Jesus: "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Matt. 2:15). This is not because Matthew is unaware that the verse is speaking of the nation of

<span id="page-242-1"></span>Sadly, Israel was not at all faithful to such a task, despite all that the Lord did for them. The complaint in Hosea 11:1–4 is that all of God's gifts did not move Israel to want him. This is a challenge for modern-day believers. What is Christianity for? Why do we follow Jesus? Is it for various gifts, such as a ticket to heaven? Or is it because we want to know him and live a life pleasing to him, in his service? After describing all the Lord has done for us in Jesus (Romans 9–11), Paul shows us the proper response: "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship" (Rom. 12:1). Wholehearted obedient love is the proper response to the goodness we have received in Jesus.

<span id="page-242-5"></span><span id="page-242-4"></span><span id="page-242-2"></span><span id="page-242-0"></span>Israel's response to the Lord's goodness in delivering them from Egypt should have been the same, but it was very different, and the Lord describes his response in incredibly human terms. He loves them—so much so that he is like a parent whose heart is torn over a rebellious child, who knows the child needs strong discipline and who will eventually bring it (Hos. 11:5–6). He cannot give up on the child (v. 8). It is thus true that God knows the end from the beginning (Isa. 46:10), and that he operates on an eternal plan conceived in decrees made between the Father and the Son before the foundation of the earth. He is completely holy, not subject to his emotions' controlling him as humans' emotions do (Hos. 11:9). But it is also true that the imagery of Hosea forcefully presents a very impassioned deity, inwardly divided and torn. And he wants his people to know this about him; he wants them to know that the depth of his anger at their rebellion, and the depth of his love despite it, is just like that of a parent toward a child who rebels.

<span id="page-242-3"></span>What this means for Israel is clear. On the one hand, they should learn to avoid sin, so that they might not experience the discipline of the Father. At the same time, they should learn that when they do rebel, the proper response is to come back to him with humble hearts, knowing that their Father will forgive them. And if this is true for Israel, how much truer it is for believers in Jesus today. In Jesus, the Lord has shown not only how seriously he takes sin—his own Son had to die for it on our behalf—he also shows how far he will go to receive us back—his own Son died so that we might become his sons and daughters! And this calls us to avoid sin with all our hearts and, when we have sinned, to return to the Lord with all our hearts—to the One who will take us back into his loving arms.

## HOSEA 11:12–12:1

<span id="page-243-4"></span>**12** *1* Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit, but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One. 12 Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt.

V. Bridge: No, They Won't; Well, Judah Will (11:12–12:1)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-243-3"></span>11:12–12:1 These two verses form a bridge between the climactic end of the great central movement in Hosea and the opening of the next movement. The critique of the northern kingdom (Ephraim) is very strong: they are characterized by "lies" and "deceit" (11:12a) and continue their habit of pursuing alliances with the nations (12:1), having entered into a treaty with Assyria. This is parallel to the obscure idiom that they "carried oil to Egypt," perhaps a reference to tribute they gave in order to secure an alliance. What is clear is that they trusted in Egypt and Assyria, and this is utter folly—like trying to nourish oneself on the wind or catch it in one's hand.

<span id="page-243-0"></span>Judah is also mentioned here (11:12), and there is debate concerning whether the reference should be understood positively or negatively. The ESV translates, "Judah still walks with God." The verb rendered "walk" is quite rare, found only four times in the Bible. One instance is in Genesis 27:40, where Isaac condemns Esau to serve his brother until he grows "restless" (same word) and breaks his yoke. Some understand Hosea 11:12 to carry this same negative nuance, translating the clause, "Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One" (NIV). If so, this would be a way of saying that the Lord is surrounded by the faithless, whether by Israel in the north or by Judah in the south.

<span id="page-243-2"></span><span id="page-243-1"></span>In another instance, however, the verb here rendered as "walk" refers to roaming (cf. Hb. of Jer. 2:31), and the word at the end of Hosea 11:12 ("faithful") can be naturally applied to Judah grammatically (so ESV). This positive perspective of Judah would reflect the historical reality that it displayed periods of faithfulness that the northern kingdom did not. In contrast to Israel, they walked with God.

## <span id="page-244-1"></span>OVERVIEW OF HOSEA 12:2–14:8

Once again, and for the final time, a major movement of Hosea begins with a "charge" or "indictment" against Israel using the Hebrew word *rib*. 38 Using fresh arguments and illustrations, the prophet and his God attempt to get the point across to a recalcitrant audience that times are desperate and change is urgently needed. The metaphors of husband-wife and father-son are finished. To awaken the conscience of the people, chapter 12 recites various well-known and treasured episodes from sacred history. In chapter 13, the Lord reasons with his people. Part of the judgment had already fallen; will they be so stupid as not to act, when God has already shown them what he is willing to do? Death is in store for them if they fail to respond to his last appeal. But then—immediately after final death is assured the mood once again abruptly shifts, and nothing but grace and forgiveness is promised (ch. 14). The book ends on this positive note as one last eloquent appeal is made to Ephraim to turn from idols and political treaties and to the living God.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-245-9"></span><span id="page-245-7"></span>The people of Israel no doubt revered the patriarch Jacob, and Hosea here assumes that they know his story. As Jacob struggled and wrestled with God (12:3) and identified with him (vv. 4–5), so also his descendants should surrender to Yahweh and return to him (v. 6). Using Jacob as an archetype, Hosea constructs a "paradigm of repentance" for Israel.39 But Ephraim is self-satisfied (vv. 7–8); they believe they are faultless and above criticism.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-245-2"></span>12:2 This is the opening verse of the last movement in Hosea, and it includes "Judah" in its indictment. The people of Judah need to understand that the same indictment is warranted against them if they pursue the same idolatrous and unjust path as Israel. Both kingdoms (Judah and Israel/Jacob) will experience the Lord's justice because of their wickedness.

<span id="page-245-5"></span><span id="page-245-3"></span><span id="page-245-0"></span>12:3–6 The name "Jacob," meaning "grasper of the heel," is taken from the verb used here (v. 3). Jacob competed and struggled with his brother from the womb (Gen. 25:26) and as an adult struggled with God (Gen. 32:28).40 The two observations in Hosea 12:3 can be considered a merism, a figure of speech that refers to a totality: e.g., "day and night" means "all the time"; "heaven and earth" means "all creation." Here, "in the womb" and "in his manhood" connote that Jacob was characterized by contention his entire life. In the words of his brother, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated ("jacobed") me these two times" (Gen. 27:36).

<span id="page-245-6"></span><span id="page-245-1"></span>Note that the last word of Hosea 12:4 is "us." This is not a review of patriarchal history for its own sake; it is the history of the people that is at issue. At Bethel God spoke with Jacob, and there he speaks with "us" too—if we are listening.

<span id="page-245-8"></span>There are various questions regarding the translation of verses 4–6. What seems clear is that Jacob's encounters with the Lord are in focus, as is the Lord

This leads to the command of verse 6: listen, then, says Hosea, and turn to Yahweh, as Jacob your father was redirected from encountering his foe, Esau, alone, to meeting him as a servant of God. This turning to God entails a commitment to "love and justice"—covenant fidelity, honest dealings, and waiting on their true God at all times for his favor and blessing. What this "love and justice" looks like is treated in verses 7–8.

<span id="page-246-4"></span><span id="page-246-3"></span><span id="page-246-2"></span>12:7–8 The prophet has called upon the people to turn to God and to hold fast to love and justice (v. 6). Instead, Ephraim is a cheating merchant who does not love Yahweh but loves to oppress (v. 7). Ephraim credits himself with his wealth, claiming to have no culpability and to be above criticism (v. 8). The people have their own positive mantra that lulls them into a false sense of security, and so the prophet's appeal falls on deaf ears. They simply will not hear it.

## *Response*

<span id="page-246-0"></span>The prophet's indictment is that God's people are unfaithful, untrue to their God and treacherous in their dealings with each other—all the while being selfsatisfied and believing themselves to be above criticism. This indictment is against not only Israel, or even Israel and Judah together. It is against the whole world, as all will likewise be judged "according to his deeds" (12:2). Although modern man may go about his life in a secular way, giving no thought to God, there is a lawsuit that awaits him. The court will sit, the charges will be read, and all who have no relationship with God in this life will have no savior in the next.

<span id="page-246-6"></span><span id="page-246-5"></span>It is of vital importance, then, to listen when God speaks, to turn with his help, and to hold fast to his gospel. Christians should not be like Ephraim, who credited himself with his own prosperity and would not accept guilt for any sin. "It is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?" (1 Pet. 4:17).

## HOSEA 12:9–13:3

- **<sup>9</sup>** I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.
- **<sup>10</sup>** I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables.
- **<sup>11</sup>** If there is iniquity in Gilead, they shall surely come to nothing:

 in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field.

- **<sup>12</sup>** Jacob fled to the land of Aram; there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep.
- **<sup>13</sup>** By a prophet the Lord brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.
- **<sup>14</sup>** Ephraim has given bitter provocation; so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds.

13 When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel, but he incurred guilt through Baal and died. **<sup>2</sup>** And now they sin more and more, and make for themselves metal images, idols skillfully made of their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of them, "Those who offer human sacrifice kiss calves!" **<sup>3</sup>** Therefore they shall be like the morning mist or like the dew that goes early away, like the chaff that swirls from the threshing floor or like smoke from a window.

## *Section Overview*

This section exhibits a repeating pattern. In the first part of the section (vv. 9–11), the Lord speaks of his past provision for Israel: he multiplied visions. This sets the contemporary situation in sharp relief: the people multiply illegal altars. In the second part of the section (vv. 12–14), Hosea references how Jacob kept sheep while the Lord kept Jacob. This again highlights the heinousness of the people's current state of affairs and explains the enmity between themselves and their Lord. Finally, Hosea continues in a third part of the section, emphasizing again the evil of the people's idolatry (13:1–3). The result is that Israel as a national entity will evaporate and disappear from the earth.

## *Comment*

12:9–11 The last section ended with Ephraim's assertion, "I am rich" (v. 8). This section begins with an emphatic, "I am the Lord your God." The Lord's presence and greatness eclipses and deflates Ephraim's self-aggrandizing pronouncements. God declares himself to be Yahweh, their God since Egyptian days. In their days before any claim to greatness, they were nomads, tent dwellers. The Feast of Tabernacles ("the appointed feast") celebrated this, but it now also serves as a warning. In response to their self-importance, God will reduce Israel to again being a nation of nomads.

<span id="page-248-4"></span><span id="page-248-2"></span>Ephraim has spoken rebelliously (v. 8) claiming to be autonomously responsible for their prosperity and beyond Yahweh's censure. In contrast, Yahweh spoke to the prophets of old (v. 10). He multiplied visions, while Ephraim multiplied falsehood (v. 1). In the literal idiom, God put parables "in the hand" of the prophets (v. 10). In verse 7, false balances are "in" Ephraim's "hand."41 Thus Yahweh is three times compared with Ephraim, demonstrating both God's loving care and patience and Ephraim's disdain and evil.

<span id="page-248-5"></span><span id="page-248-3"></span>Various other regions besides Ephraim also are cited in order to force the realization that the indictment is against the whole land (v. 11). The Hebrew word for Gilead's "iniquity" was probably pronounced the same as the word for Ephraim's "wealth" in verse 8. They see wealth and power; God sees guilt and punishable idolatry.

Gilgal (v. 11) was the first city occupied by Joshua, and was the staging area for the conquest. To mention it here invites comparisons to this earlier period. In Gilgal, illegal altars were as common as stones piled in "furrows of the field" (cf. 10:4).

<span id="page-248-7"></span><span id="page-248-1"></span><span id="page-248-0"></span>12:12–14 The first verse of this section recites another piece of sacred history. After deceiving his father, Jacob fled to stay with Laban, for whom he worked fourteen years for Rachel by guarding sheep (Genesis 29). In a similar way, the Lord tended to Israel (by means of a prophet) and also did so in a foreign land, bringing Israel up from there. The last word in Hosea 12:13 is the same as the last word in the Hebrew of 12:12 ("guarded"). Jacob kept sheep, and his descendants were kept by Yahweh.

<span id="page-248-8"></span><span id="page-248-6"></span>No doubt the "prophet" that Hosea has in mind here (v. 13) is Moses. But why does he use this cryptic reference to an unnamed prophet instead of specifying Moses as the prophet who brought Israel up from Egypt? Hosea seems to be stressing the similarities between Israel at the time of the exodus and Israel in his own day. As God brought the nation from bondage in the days of Egypt through a prophet, so now he has sent his prophet to them for their good, to save them from being enslaved again and taken to a new Egypt—Assyria. Hosea is then the new Moses to this new generation.

<span id="page-248-9"></span>What is Ephraim's response? He has irritated and exasperated his Lord to the point where nothing is left except bloodguilt and reproach (v. 14). The people celebrate Jacob in their ceremonies and call themselves his descendants, but the God of Jacob will no longer guard Ephraim as he did their patriarch. Instead, he

<sup>41</sup> Robert B. Coote, "Hosea XII," *VT* 21/4 (1971): 397.

<span id="page-249-5"></span><span id="page-249-3"></span>will "repay" them. The Hebrew term translated "repay" is *shub*, the same word that elsewhere carries the sense of "turn, return." Since Israel will not return (*shub*) to the Lord (v. 6), the Lord will return (*shub*) Israel's reproach back onto the nation (v. 14).

<span id="page-249-6"></span><span id="page-249-1"></span>13:1–3 "Ephraim" and "Israel" refer to the same religio-political entity throughout the book (5:3–9; 7:1; 8:8–9; 10:6; etc.), and 13:1 should be read in the same way. The first part of verse 1 is difficult to translate. The ESV faithfully renders the current Hebrew text, but it is not clear why Ephraim's speech would result in trembling. There was never a time in which Ephraim as a tribe was highly regarded. The book of Judges treats the tribe as dangerously foolish, hotheads who are not around when work needs to be done but who complain later that they were left out. Thus some have proposed a very slight change that would result in the speaker of the verse being God: "When [God] spoke, Ephraim trembled. . . . He [God] was exalted in Israel."42

<span id="page-249-0"></span>The phrase "through Baal" can also be read as "in Baal"—i.e., at Baal-peor, the paradigmatic site of Israel's great rebellion.43 Twenty-four thousand Israelites died there (Num. 25:1–9). While Ephraim may have at first revered God, this quickly turned to rejection of him, leading to grave consequences.

If history repeats itself, what sort of death awaits the nation of Israel? The kingdom will fail and the people will be disseminated throughout the earth. This is the death awaiting them. They will be cut down to a nomadic existence, fading away into nonexistence.

<span id="page-249-2"></span>Since Baal-peor, they have added idol to idol and made themselves onerous (Hos. 12:2). Human sacrifice seems to be in view here. This may explain further the motif of death in 13:1: the people continue to die due to idolatry.

Because of this sort of sin, Israel will die as a nation. Four images in rapid succession signify Israel's shortened lifespan (v. 3). They are like dew at daybreak and will evaporate into nothing by midmorning. Like mist or smoke, they will disappear as if they had never been. Just as the smallest breeze blows away chaff (agricultural dust), so it will be with Ephraim.

There is no hope in these verses. The people have made their choice. Between Baal, the calf, and innumerable idols, they have refused to follow the lead of God's prophet. Thus he will not save them when the time of judgment comes.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-249-7"></span><span id="page-249-4"></span>Jacob tended sheep (12:12). Yahweh tended Israel (12:13), eventually sending his Son to be the Great Shepherd for us all. It is because Jesus tends to us that we are not like morning mist or chaff in the wind (13:3). This is true of each one of us personally, but even more so in matters pertaining to the mission of the church. Christ ensures that we will succeed in the end, bringing every thought captive to him and making disciples of all nations.

<sup>42</sup> Cf. Andersen and Freedman, *Hosea*, 629.

<sup>43</sup> Ibid., 630.

<span id="page-250-2"></span><span id="page-250-0"></span>To guide and care for Israel, God sent them prophets, even providing parables to the nation to frame the issues for them (12:10). God saved them from slavery in Egypt through a prophet (12:13). From the time of the patriarch Jacob, God materially and spiritually provided for his people. He guarded them, saved them, spoke to them, and blessed them. It was God's guidance through a prophet that set them free from bondage in Egypt. The same is true for us today. It is Jesus who teaches us and the Bible that guides us. As it was for ancient Israel, so it is for us: all we need do is believe and trust, and all else will follow.

<span id="page-250-7"></span><span id="page-250-5"></span><span id="page-250-1"></span>Israel was led into freedom by the prophet (12:13). Today, the truth of the gospel is what sets us free (John 8:32). Thus we must be careful not to reject this truth, as Israel did and therefore died (Heb. 12:25). In Hosea, Israel is admonished to look to Jacob for inspiration (Hos. 12:12). Today, Christians are admonished to look to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, and follow his example (Heb. 12:2). He endured the cross, despising its shame, and attained the seat at the right hand of God.

<span id="page-250-6"></span><span id="page-250-4"></span><span id="page-250-3"></span>Likewise, Christians should be willing to suffer the loss of pleasures and luxuries, and even be willing to suffer pain and death, for the sake of the gospel. To do this, one must foster a close relationship with Christ, living dependently and worthy of one's calling. Let us not be distracted like Ephraim, messing about with silver and gold while missing out on our glorious Lord (Hos. 13:1–3).

## HOSEA 13:4–16

- **<sup>4</sup>** But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior.
- **<sup>5</sup>** It was I who knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought;
- **<sup>6</sup>** but when they had grazed,*<sup>1</sup>* they became full, they were filled, and their heart was lifted up; therefore they forgot me.
- **<sup>7</sup>** So I am to them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.

**<sup>8</sup>** I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs; I will tear open their breast, and there I will devour them like a lion, as a wild beast would rip them open.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-251-0"></span>This section highlights the impossibility of blessing a faithless people. Every time God gives prosperity and abundance to Israel, they turn it into evil (13:4–6). At the very least, they forget who gave them these good things. No matter what God does, Israel cannot help but bring more judgment upon themselves.

<span id="page-251-4"></span><span id="page-251-3"></span><span id="page-251-2"></span><span id="page-251-1"></span>Thus God's response will be to consume them as a nation. They will be savagely sundered until nothing will remain. God compares himself to no less than four ravenous animals in two verses, leaving Israel without a shred of flesh (vv. 7–8). Their leaders will be no help (vv. 9–11). Ephraim is too foolish to know how to pursue life—like an unborn child too foolish to be born (vv. 12–13). Their end will be destruction (vv. 14–16).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-252-5"></span><span id="page-252-4"></span><span id="page-252-3"></span>13:4–6 This section opens with the same emphatic declaration with which the previous section began (cf. 12:9): "I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt." Since the days of their rescue from Egypt, Israel's only God to whom they could turn has been Yahweh. There has never been a genuine savior besides this God. They "know" none but him, just as he "knew" them in the wilderness (13:5). In the book of Hosea, to "know" involves more than correct theology. It necessarily includes a warm and intimate relationship. Mutual knowing characterized the early days, in which God led them in the desert.

God pastured them, and they ate to satisfaction (v. 6). Yet that is when the relationship took a sour turn. Israel's heart was "lifted up" in pride, and they forgot their benefactor. Once again the dilemma is stated: God cannot bless his people without their turning that blessing into something negative and thereby bringing more judgment on themselves (e.g., 4:7; 10:1; 11:2).

<span id="page-252-6"></span><span id="page-252-2"></span><span id="page-252-1"></span>13:7–8 Once again in Hosea, God is likened to a savage animal (e.g., 5:14; 11:10). Four, in fact: a lion, a leopard, a bear, and a "wild beast." God will lurk, he will stalk, he will fall upon his victim, he will eviscerate, he will devour. The bear is specifically said to be separated from its cubs, meaning it has been roused to absolute fury. God will tear open Israel's "breast." He will brutally rend and tear with claws and teeth until their very beating heart is exposed. Then he will continue to rip them into gobbets and eat them. Once again in Hosea, the imagery used to describe the living God conveys anything but a cool, dispassionate deity.

Israel is depicted as helpless and defenseless before a rampaging God. There is no hope in these verses. Once again, a judgment is predicted that leaves Israel dead and gone. There is no coming back from this. As a people, as a kingdom, they will be devoured.

<span id="page-252-8"></span><span id="page-252-7"></span><span id="page-252-0"></span>13:9–11 Here again the argument is gleaned from sacred history. Moving on from the exodus and the wilderness, the era of the judges ("rulers") is now in review (v. 10), specifically the end of that period, when Israel demanded of Samuel that God give them a king to rule them "like all the nations" (1 Sam. 8:5). This is elucidated in Hosea 13:10 by the addition of the request for "princes," implying that they demanded a ruling dynasty. In 1 Samuel, God declared that this request was a rejection of God as their king — but he gave them one <span id="page-253-1"></span>anyway (1 Sam. 8:7). In Hosea, Yahweh affirms that he did in fact give them a king like they wanted — but he also in righteous anger later removed that king (Hos. 13:11).

<span id="page-253-2"></span>This could mean that the last king of Israel was about to be permanently removed when Israel was disseminated among the nations. Or it might speak of a recent assassination of a specific king. Alternatively, it could refer to Saul, the first king that God gave Israel and whom God later removed. In any case, the point is clear: God is sovereign over the nation. He gives and removes kings as he sees fit. The earthly king, then, is of no help on his own. To look to the human king is worthless. Only their divine King can save them. But they are against him (v. 9b) and thus have foolishly left themselves vulnerable.

<span id="page-253-3"></span>13:12–13 Ephraim's sin and iniquity are bound to him and hidden within him. There is no separating the sin from the sinner. What sin in particular is in mind? Perhaps the sin explicated in the previous verses: Israel's evil request for a king.

The topic of wisdom is introduced briefly here, as it is again in the closing verse of the book; here Ephraim is called an "unwise son." The prophet states that "The pangs of childbirth come for him": Ephraim will feel the sort of pain an infant might experience while being birthed. But, because he is foolish, "at the right time he does not present himself at the opening of the womb." In other words, he is too lamebrained to be born! Of course, an infant who stays in the womb faces certain death. Ephraim is too foolish to know where life is; there is no future, no progeny, for him.

<span id="page-253-5"></span><span id="page-253-4"></span><span id="page-253-0"></span>13:14–16 Samaria (the capital city of Israel) is consigned to the grave. She is already given over to death. The Hebrew word translated "sting" (v. 14) is elsewhere translated in the ESV as "pestilence" (Deut. 32:24) or "destruction" (Ps. 91:6). The plagues of the grave and the sting of death are called into action—they represent Assyria, which was poised to tear into Israel. Plague and destroying pestilence are invoked against Samaria. There will be no compassion from God.

<span id="page-253-6"></span>The plague and sting of death come with Yahweh's east wind, which will dry up Samaria's spring and fountain (Hos. 13:15); in other words, she will be plundered and looted.

<span id="page-253-7"></span>The final thought of this section leaves metaphor behind and speaks clearly and without the need for clarification or interpretation (v. 16). The end will be bad, very bad. When Samaria falls, those pregnant will be "ripped open." Simply put, "They shall fall by the sword." Could the message have been any clearer?

#### *Response*

God is Israel's helper, whether they acknowledge him or not. He is their King and Savior. But they rejected him and asked for a human king and savior instead. As an act of judgment, God gave them Saul, a king who could not save or deliver. As an act of mercy and grace, he then gave them David, a king the Lord blessed and used to rescue and deliver. From David came a line of kings, ultimately ending with Jesus, the great King that God gave to Israel and the world. Paradoxically, however, he is not a political or military king. In Christ, redemptive history has gone full circle to God's again being the people's King.

The challenge to Christians today is to come to terms with Christ as their true King. Are believers able to rest in him, find refuge in him, trust him with their lives, follow him? Or, like ancient Israel, will they also seek some earthly supplement in order to feel secure? God declares that he has always been his people's help, and to look elsewhere than to him and to Christ for security is to miss out on true peace.

<span id="page-254-0"></span>Paul cites Hosea 13:14 in 1 Corinthians 15:55, applying it to a different context. In Hosea 13:14, death and its sting are called into action to punish Israel. In 1 Corinthians 15:55, death and its sting are told they have no power over followers of Jesus, who will be resurrected at the last day.

Paul knew and had experienced what had not yet been revealed in Hosea's time: death itself will roll backward, and the people of God can and will be redeemed even after death temporarily takes them. This is seen in Christ's resurrection, in which believers find the promise that death ultimately will have no sting, because Christ has defeated it once and for all, and thus resurrection will ensue for all who die in faith. Death will have no final victory. The grave is not the last word for Christians. Thus, in confidence, Christians may put aside their trust in other things and press on to live faithfully for this King whom God has given.

## HOSEA 14:1–8

<span id="page-254-1"></span>14 Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God,

for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.

**<sup>2</sup>** Take with you words and return to the Lord; say to him,

"Take away all iniquity;

### *Section Overview*

The previous section of Hosea spoke of Sheol and Death. There God was likened to an animal in blind fury, rending and tearing. With such an animal there is no appeal, no reasoning. The last word in chapter 13 was that Israel would surely fall, and the fall would be brutal. Every citizen would suffer. The nation would be torn to pieces. Such a judgment of hopelessness is how the chapter concluded.

<span id="page-255-1"></span><span id="page-255-0"></span>But the last words of Hosea 13 are not the last words of the book! Once again in Hosea the mood suddenly shifts to its opposite extreme. We must treat chapter 13 as conditional — the events described there will happen if the people do not turn. Hosea in 14:1–3 interprets the Lord's previous prophecies as a warning that is yet avoidable. He appeals one last time for the people to heed and turn. Hosea specifically encourages the people to realize that "Assyria will not save us."

Of course, historically, the judgment did certainly fall. The nation was horrifically dismembered. But in the time between God's threat and its fulfillment, Israel had a brief opportunity to be saved. It seems that a few faithful Israelites did heed the message and fled, carrying the scroll of Hosea south with them (cf. Introduction: Setting and Audience).

<span id="page-255-2"></span>Giving the impression that his emotions have changed, Yahweh now speaks with tenderness of his good intentions toward his people (14:4–8). He will heal and love them. He will bless them so that they will sprout and grow, take deep root, flourish, and blossom. This is a certain promise to those who turn back to him with repentant hearts and lives.

- <span id="page-256-9"></span><span id="page-256-1"></span>3. An Evergreen Cypress (14:8)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-256-2"></span>14:1–3 In the first three verses, Hosea the prophet speaks. Hosea appeals to his audience to "return" (Hb. *shub*) to the Lord (v. 1). This calls for a change of heart and mind, including a conscious recognition that they have erred and have been misled by their sin.

<span id="page-256-3"></span>The translation "We will pay with bulls the vows of our lips" (v. 2) is a good attempt to wrest meaning from the Hebrew, which is obscure. It consists of the verb "Let us pay" followed by the terms for "bulls" and "our lips." Despite the rough syntax, the overall meaning of the phrase is clear: Israel is called upon to give God a proper offering and to serve him.

<span id="page-256-4"></span>Israel must repent of worshiping its own military might and of trusting in Assyria (v. 3). God is the one who saves. He particularly is close to the underprivileged in society, such as the orphan, who here represents all who are disenfranchised and marginalized, helpless and in need of a savior; they will find compassion in Yahweh. In Hosea's time, no one needed a savior more than the nation Israel.

14:4–7 Yahweh now begins to speak again and will do so until the end of the book, with the exception of the closing verse. He confirms the prophet's message, adding a blessed vision of the future, a time when all of these issues will have been satisfactorily dealt with and nothing will be left to hold him back from showering his people with blessing after blessing.

<span id="page-256-5"></span><span id="page-256-0"></span>"I will heal their apostasy" (v. 4), the Lord promises. The word "apostasy" is a form of *shub*, describing a turning away from God (cf. 11:7). This is matched with God's own turning: "My anger has turned from them." God responds to his own turning by healing the people from theirs.

<span id="page-256-8"></span><span id="page-256-7"></span>The God of the universe will be like dew for his people (14:5). Terms such as "lily" and "fragrance," as well as references to Lebanon and other imagery of verses 6–7, bring to mind the Song of Solomon, as if this section were God's love song to Israel. His people will blossom like a lily; they will put down roots like the paradigmatic cedars of Lebanon. Their glory will be like that of the olive tree, a never-ending supply of oil. They will raise corn and make wine; they will be famous and will flourish.

14:8 One last verse summarizes the thought of, perhaps, the whole book. It is Yahweh, not idols, who answers Ephraim's prayers and guards him. The Lord compares himself to a cypress that is evergreen: the Lord is the perpetual source of every blessing Israel has ever experienced as a nation. Because of this, God's people should acknowledge him and be saved.

#### *Response*

These verses are filled with hope. They describe the good news that the Lord receives those who turn to him, and he does so in the most amazing of ways. He heals them of their sin; he turns from the anger of judgment to the love of forgiveness; he is like refreshing dew to those who have been suffering in the wilderness of sin. And those who receive such love and forgiveness cannot help but prosper, blossoming like flowers, placing deep roots like well-established, strong trees, flourishing and being fruitful as they rest under the protective shadow of the Lord, the one who sustains them.

This happens today as people turn to the Lord by following his Son, Jesus, through whom ultimate healing and forgiveness of sin takes place. This is possible only because "He was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed" (Isa. 53:5). His sacrifice is the one that can "take away all iniquity" (Hos. 14:2), if only we heed his call to come and follow him.

<span id="page-257-3"></span><span id="page-257-1"></span><span id="page-257-0"></span>And that is the question: will we heed this call? Hosea called the people of his day to turn back to the Lord before it was too late; he urged them to receive the Lord's forgiveness and love instead of his justice for their wrongs; he desired them to flourish under the Lord's love and care, for this is what they had been created for. In the NT, Peter gives a similar call when he urges people to turn to faith in Jesus: "Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord" (Acts 3:19–20a). Yes, God will take in and heal all who come to Jesus, but the opportunity is now. Why would we wait?

## HOSEA 14:9

<span id="page-257-2"></span>**<sup>9</sup>** Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them.

#### *Section Outline*

VII. Closing (14:9)

### *Comment and Response*

14:9 The final verse provides a proverbial ending to the book. It is a call to stand back, reflect, and consider all the words of Hosea. The sage will discern for himself the truth of the matter, which is that the Lord's "ways . . . are right." This connects the book with Proverbs, where wisdom is conceptualized as a path to follow. The upright walk that path of wisdom, for it is a safe and secure path on which we can flourish. But it is a path that requires a heart submissive to the Lord and his ways. To refuse to submit is to lose our footing, to stumble in the way and fall. In place of flourishing and life, those who avoid the Lord's ways find only destruction and death.

Jesus ends his Sermon on the Mount with similar words. This is no surprise, for he is the ultimate manifestation of the Lord's wisdom and ways; to heed his words and follow him is to walk upon this path of life with the Lord himself, experiencing all of the joy and peace that flow from that obedience. To change the metaphor, heeding Jesus' words and following him provides a secure and stable foundation on which our life can rest solid and secure, come what may.

This is the very metaphor with which Jesus ends his well-known Sermon:

Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (Matt. 7:24–27)

## INTRODUCTION TO

# <span id="page-263-1"></span>JOEL

## *Overview*

<span id="page-263-8"></span><span id="page-263-7"></span><span id="page-263-6"></span><span id="page-263-5"></span><span id="page-263-4"></span><span id="page-263-3"></span><span id="page-263-0"></span>This book is presented as a message from God given to Joel. Although it is not explicitly stated, it seems clear from the content of the book that it was directed to the southern kingdom of Judah and its capital, Jerusalem (Joel 2:1, 15; 3:1, 6). The message begins with a description of a coming plague of locusts (1:2–12; cf. Interpretive Challenges for discussion on understanding these references to locusts). The people are encouraged to meet in corporate worship and cry out to the Lord, for the day of the Lord is at hand (1:15). This day will be a day of darkness and gloom (2:1–2). Joel's encouragement to the people is his repeated call to return to the Lord with all their hearts (2:12–13). The assurance is given that God, who had revealed his character to Moses (cf. Ex. 34:6–7), would show mercy and spare his people (Joel 2:17). The locusts will be removed, the land will again produce in abundance, and the people will realize that the Lord their God is indeed in their midst (2:27). The promise is given of an abundant outpouring of God's Spirit, along with a supernatural revelation of his power in heaven and earth. The final chapter (ch. 3) is devoted to the themes of judgment on the Gentile nations (3:1–16) and expectation of a glorious future for Judah (3:17–21). Judah and Jerusalem are promised blessing, but God will render judgment on their neighbors so that all may know that the Lord who dwells in Zion is a refuge and stronghold for his people (3:16–17, 21).

## <span id="page-263-11"></span><span id="page-263-10"></span><span id="page-263-9"></span>*Title*

The title of the book is simply *yo'el* in Hebrew, which the Septuagint (LXX) transliterated as *Iōēl* and which is rendered in English as Joel.

## *Author*

<span id="page-263-2"></span>The author is named as "Joel, the son of Pethuel" (1:1). Nothing more is known of either man. The name Joel is a combination of an abbreviated form of the covenantal name of God, *Yahweh* ("the Lord"), with the common Hebrew word for God, *'el*, and thus means "Yahweh is God." The prophet Joel shares this name with about twelve other men in the OT but cannot be identified with any of them. The

<span id="page-264-5"></span><span id="page-264-3"></span>name "Pethuel" occurs nowhere else in the OT, and its meaning is uncertain.1 That Joel refers several times to the work of the priests at the temple (cf. 1:9, 13–14; 2:14–17) suggests he came from a priestly family.

### *Date and Occasion*

The book of Joel differs from many of the other Prophetic Books of the OT in that it contains so little information regarding the historical period in which the prophet ministered or the circumstances prompting this message from the Lord. In the Hebrew Bible, the so-called Minor Prophets (Hosea to Malachi) seem to be listed in what was considered a chronological order. Joel follows Hosea, who prophesied in the mid-eighth century BC, and precedes Amos, who ministered in that same period. This ordering should be noted, but it provides no definitive dating for the book, since the process of divine inspiration of the books of the OT surely did not extend to their ordering, which came much later. The LXX exhibits a slightly different order, placing Joel after Micah and thus fourth in the order of the minor prophets.

Any proposed dating must therefore be dependent on information provided in the book of Joel itself or on other factors such as the use of similar content in other Prophetic Books. While it is possible to interpret the book without determining its precise date, dating can influence interpretation of the book as well as affect the understanding of how it was used and received at the time. Two major positions have been adopted on this question of dating. Both assume that the date of composition comes later than the division of the kingdom in 930 BC into Judah and Israel (note the mention of "Judah" in 3:1, 6, etc.) and that Joel's mention of the temple (1:9, 13) means it was in operation (thus excluding the period of 586 to 516 BC).

<span id="page-264-8"></span><span id="page-264-7"></span><span id="page-264-6"></span><span id="page-264-4"></span>Aside from this agreement, however, the positions come to very different conclusions. On one hand, it has long been claimed that various strands of evidence point to an early date. Unlike many of the other Prophetic Books, Joel makes no reference to later enemies of Israel such as Syria, Assyria, and Babylon, while he does mention ancient foes such as the Phoenicians and Philistines (3:4) and the Egyptians and Edomites (3:19). Failure to mention the later enemy nations suggests they were not contemporaneous with Joel's ministry. This and other factors suggest a date as early as the reign of Jehoram (848–841 BC; cf. 2 Chron. 21:16–17 for reference to an invasion of Judah by the Philistines). Others, however, have maintained that the evidence points to a date around the time of the exile. Support for this position includes absence of references to a king or to the northern kingdom, addressing the priests as if they were in control, and hints of parallels with Zephaniah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.

<span id="page-264-2"></span>In light of the evidence, on balance it seems the early date is more probable. The absence of any reference to the later foes of Judah points this way, while the supposed evidence cited by those advocating a late date could be explained in other

<span id="page-264-1"></span><span id="page-264-0"></span><sup>1</sup> The Septuagint rendered it "Bathuel," which is its rendering of the name "Bethuel" in Genesis 22:23 and 1 Chronicles 4:30. This might suggest we should read "Bethuel" here as well, though certainty is difficult.

ways. Moreover, the language, style, and contents of Joel are closest to the eighthcentury-BC prophets—Amos, Hosea, Micah, and Isaiah. This position asserts that similarities with other prophets are the result of their borrowing either from Joel (and not vice versa) or from a common pool of teaching. Further, if Joel had been composed late in OT history, some greater precision, especially concerning the day of the Lord, could have been expected.

## *Genre and Literary Structure*

Joel displays many of the features common to biblical prophecy. For example, it is poetic in form, lacks specific dates either of composition or in relation to the outcome of its messages, and combines warnings and encouragements comparably to other prophets. In addition, it is difficult to be certain about any time gap between the events Joel describes, as it uses phrases like "in that day" and "in those days" that do not reveal whether an event is near at hand or still far off.

<span id="page-265-3"></span>The structure of the book is relatively straightforward. The locust invasion is detailed in 1:1–2:17, while 2:18–3:21, in addition to its warnings, contains pictures of future blessing. Some scholars have postulated that the two sections come from different authors, but no textual or other evidence can substantiate this. Nor is it possible to prove, as some suggest, that the book formed a liturgical text for worshipers in the later years of Judah. Most of Joel lacks the precision of statement necessary for a document to be used frequently in the temple or synagogue.

### *Theology of Joel; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-265-4"></span><span id="page-265-0"></span>Readers of the book of Joel cannot expect it to contain the same wealth of theological content found in larger prophetic books such as Isaiah or Jeremiah. However, its contents bear many similarities to those books, for it is likewise addressed to the covenant people of God. Although the actual word "covenant" (*berit*) does not occur in Joel, there are, nevertheless, several other indicators pointing to the covenantal relationship between God and his people. Thirty-three times in the book God is referred to by his covenantal name "the Lord" (*Yahweh*). From the time of the exodus, that had become the standard name by which to refer to Israel's God (cf. Ex. 3:13–17). In the book of Joel this "Lord" refers to Judah as "my people" (Joel 2:26, 27; 3:2) and "my heritage" (3:2) and calls Palestine "my land" (1:6; 3:2). Joel calls the temple "the house of our God" (1:16) and in addressing God refers to Judah as "your people" and "your heritage" (2:17). The double appearance of the declaration "I am the Lord your God" is significant (2:27; 3:17), for it echoes the opening words of the Decalogue (Ex. 20:2; Deut. 5:6). Furthermore, the double use of the name "Israel" (Joel 2:27; 3:2) to describe the southern kingdom of Judah is also an important indicator, for although the northern kingdom had usurped that name for itself when the kingdom split (cf. 1 Kings 12:16), the Lord still regarded Judah as his own, his Israel.

<span id="page-265-7"></span><span id="page-265-6"></span><span id="page-265-5"></span><span id="page-265-2"></span><span id="page-265-1"></span>The theological message of Joel flows out of this covenantal relationship. God is bringing punishment on his people in the form of a locust plague. This judgment is declared to be "the day of the Lord," a great and awesome day that had no precedent. God, who controls the natural world and utilizes both insect plagues and supernatural events to effect his will, will visit his people because of their sins.

<span id="page-266-0"></span>But mercy is still foremost in God's attitude to his covenantal people. The invitation is given to return in penitence to him and find him to be gracious and compassionate (Joel 2:12–13), using the language of Exodus 34:6 that had virtually become a creedal statement for Israel and Judah. The promise is that days of blessing will come again when the people recognize that the Lord is God and "there is none else" (Joel 2:27). These words are an assertion of God's uniqueness, echoing Deuteronomy 4:35, 39 and paralleling Isaiah (cf. Isa. 43:11; 44:6; 45:6, 14, 22). The God who dwells in Zion (Joel 2:32; 3:16, 21) will be a refuge and a stronghold for them.

<span id="page-266-5"></span><span id="page-266-4"></span><span id="page-266-3"></span>The book of Joel does not contain oracles against the Gentile nations such as those found in Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, but the same teaching as in these books is expressed in Joel. The nations are answerable to God for their misdeeds, especially for how they scattered his people through trade with distant places. God, in his sovereignty, will gather these nations for judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the valley of decision (Joel 3:2, 12, 14).

<span id="page-266-9"></span><span id="page-266-8"></span><span id="page-266-7"></span><span id="page-266-6"></span>Joel's prophecy does not contain any direct messianic teaching, but the NT uses it in three ways. Peter quotes from Joel 2:28–32 in his speech on the day of Pentecost to demonstrate that proclamation of the news of salvation would be the task not of a select few but of many who would receive the Spirit (Acts 2:17–21). Second, Paul in Romans 10:13 quotes from the same passage to which Peter appealed, focusing especially on the words, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Joel 2:32). He applies the title "Lord" to Jesus, and in the context the "calling" spoken of comes from a genuine conviction that salvation is found in him. Then, John in the book of Revelation exhibits knowledge of Joel's prophecy and incorporates ideas from it into his presentation of eschatological events (cf. Rev. 6:17; 9:7; 14:14–16).

## <span id="page-266-10"></span>*Preaching from Joel*

To understand and preach from Joel, one must understand where the book fits into the development of OT biblical theology. It is important to begin by noting that the prophets were God's provision for continuing divine revelation in Israel/Judah. They were not originators of new teaching but rather were called to challenge the commitment of the people to God's covenantal requirements in the Mosaic law. They guarded the relationship between God and his people and applied both the blessings and the curses of the covenant set out in Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 4 and 27–28. This is what Joel is doing here: he is acting as covenant enforcer among the people.

<span id="page-266-2"></span><span id="page-266-1"></span>The second point to emphasize is that a particular prophet like Joel (and especially such a small book) cannot be properly assessed independently of other prophets. Noting the connections among the teachings of the Prophetic Books

<span id="page-267-2"></span><span id="page-267-0"></span>helps us to grasp the significance of their message and renders presentation of it in preaching considerably easier. Smaller books like Joel are illuminated by passages in longer Prophetic Books, enabling us to grasp the breadth of teaching stated much more concisely in the smaller books. In this regard, the teaching of Joel matches many other passages in the other prophets, especially those of the eighth century BC (Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, and Micah). In particular, Joel and Amos seem very close (cf. Joel 1:4 and 2:25 with Amos 4:9, and Joel 3:18 with Amos 9:13). Both books are notable for their presentation of the day of the Lord (Joel 1:15; 2:1–2; Amos 5:18–20). In cases like this, it is impossible to prove which prophet was the earlier one. It is also possible there could have been common teaching shared by several prophets (cf. the almost identical passages in Isa. 2:2–4 and Mic. 4:1–3).

<span id="page-267-4"></span><span id="page-267-3"></span><span id="page-267-1"></span>The task of preaching from Joel is the same as preaching from any other OT Prophetic Book. The prophets were messengers of the covenant, seeking to reclaim people to adherence to it while pointing forward to a new day when the covenant would be refined into something far superior. Joel can be taken as another illustration of the principle that God will hold his own people accountable for their sins. They cannot gloat over the sins of others, for judgment begins with the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). However, when his people are persecuted, he will vindicate them.

<span id="page-267-8"></span><span id="page-267-5"></span>But above all, preaching from this book must include a message of grace and hope. The covenantal God is the God of compassion and mercy. Although that was demonstrated in many ways in the OT, both by sacrificial ritual and by spoken word, in Christ's coming and work it reached its perfection. Two songs in Luke 1, Mary's Magnificat (1:46–55) and Zechariah's Benedictus (1:68–79), are important for demonstrating the covenantal continuity linking the OT and the NT. Both songs rejoice in God's saving work reaching its fulfillment in Christ's coming and ministry. He came to help Israel "in remembrance of his mercy" (1:54), and salvation and forgiveness are grounded upon "the tender mercy of our God" (1:77–78). Anyone preaching from Joel must make the link between his understanding of grace and forgiveness and the fulfillment that his message, and that of his fellow prophets, found in Christ.

### <span id="page-267-7"></span><span id="page-267-6"></span>*Interpretive Challenges*

#### THE POETICAL NATURE OF THE BOOK

If the book of Joel is regarded as early (cf. Date and Occasion), it forms a bridge between the work and ministry of the earlier prophets and the later writing prophets. While the ministry of earlier prophets, such as Elijah and Elisha, was oral, not written, later prophets started to minister God's word by writing as well as speaking their messages. The other significant characteristic of their ministries was the essentially poetic form of this written body of work.

Poetry can be an incredibly powerful way to communicate. It does not speak in abstractions but rather utilizes simile and metaphor to convey truth in concrete forms. Readers or hearers of poetry do not simply listen to or read an abstract idea; they experience the content by means of powerful images to which they can easily relate. Joel's use of imagery, most of it in warning passages, must have brought home to those of his day—in a very dramatic way—the awful reality of God's judgments.2

But the use of imagery also presents challenges. Some of Joel's images are not common today, and it can be difficult to know if a particular image is metaphorical or real (cf. the following discussion on locusts). It is also true that poetry—whether in ancient Hebrew or in modern English—uses language that differs from prose, which presents an additional challenge. While the English text must be an accurate translation, modern interpreters and preachers must search for appropriate present-day equivalents or illustrations to convey the same truths to readers or listeners. This adds to the task of applying biblical poetry to our contemporaries, but it is a necessary part of the interpreter's role.

#### LOCUSTS

Discussion concerning the locusts featuring so prominently in Joel goes back at least to the early church fathers. It was considered probable by early Christian commentators that the locusts had to be interpreted allegorically, representing future world powers opposed to Christ. This view has generally been abandoned. More common today is the view that the locusts were a metaphor for ordinary soldiers. Hence it is asserted that Joel is in fact describing an invading army coming from the north (cf. 2:20), and the picture of locusts is employed by him to portray graphically the drastic consequences for Judah and Jerusalem of such an invasion.

<span id="page-268-4"></span><span id="page-268-3"></span><span id="page-268-2"></span><span id="page-268-1"></span>However, there are several clues in the book itself that an invasion of actual locusts is being described. Joel's descriptions of the invasion involve activities impossible to humans (e.g., the description in 2:8–9), and it seems most unlikely that he would describe an army of real soldiers as "*like* a powerful army" or real horses as "*like* the appearance of horses" (2:4–5). Moreover, the wording concerning the promised restoration (2:14, 18–27) supports this interpretation. Restoration is stated in terms of repair of the country not from the ravages of an invading army but from the results of famine caused by a locust plague.3 Examples of such locust invasions in Palestine can be cited from several occasions in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries; the 1915 plague is particularly well documented. The reference to the north (2:20) fits perfectly with this example, as it is from the north that the locusts of 1915 came. Finally, among the signs and wonders God performed in Egypt at the time of the exodus was a plague of locusts (Ex. 10:1–20). There is no reason to exclude the possibility of another visitation in judgment of a similar kind at this later point in biblical history.

<span id="page-268-0"></span><sup>2</sup> In addition to other discussions on Hebrew poetry, see especially Leland Ryken, "Respect for the Principles of Poetry," in his *The Word of God in English: Criteria and Excellence in Bible Translation* (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2002), 243–256.

<sup>3</sup> A modern parallel is cited by Peter Craigie: when he was writing on Joel in Alberta, western Canada, in 1984, he witnessed from his study window a locust plague. See his *The Old Testament: Its Background, Growth and Content* (Nashville: Abingdon, 2000), 178–189.

## THE DAY OF THE LORD

<span id="page-269-2"></span><span id="page-269-1"></span>The concept of the day of the Lord in Joel has several facets. First, it is used to refer to a day of judgment for Israel, and this may well have been a surprise to the people, who had positive anticipation of such a day (cf. comment on 1:15). The imminence of the judgment may well have added to this surprise. Secondly, the phrase "the day of the Lord" can refer to a special visitation when God's saving power on behalf of his people is demonstrated (cf. comments on 2:28–29; 3:14–16). Moreover, as these passages show, the phrase could refer to both an imminent day of deliverance and such a day in the distant future. This explains why the NT writers at times applied such passages to their own day: they realized that the end-time events were the ultimate demonstration of the concepts of judgment and deliverance spoken of by the prophets. An important parallel can be drawn to the way in which the OT prophets used the exodus concept for the return of the people after exile (Jer. 16:14) and the way in which that concept was used in the NT of Jesus' saving ministry, the ultimate act of "exodus" from exile for God's people (cf. ESV mg. at Luke 9:31).

## JOEL 1:1–12

<span id="page-270-0"></span>1 The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:

- **<sup>2</sup>** Hear this, you elders; give ear, all inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
- **<sup>3</sup>** Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.
- **<sup>4</sup>** What the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten. What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.
- **<sup>5</sup>** Awake, you drunkards, and weep, and wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
- **<sup>6</sup>** For a nation has come up against my land, powerful and beyond number; its teeth are lions' teeth,
- and it has the fangs of a lioness.
- **<sup>7</sup>** It has laid waste my vine and splintered my fig tree; it has stripped off their bark and thrown it down; their branches are made white.
- **<sup>8</sup>** Lament like a virgin*<sup>1</sup>* wearing sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth.
- **<sup>9</sup>** The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the Lord. The priests mourn,
- the ministers of the Lord.
- **<sup>10</sup>** The fields are destroyed, the ground mourns, because the grain is destroyed, the wine dries up, the oil languishes.
- **<sup>11</sup>** Be ashamed,*<sup>2</sup>* O tillers of the soil; wail, O vinedressers,

 for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished. **<sup>12</sup>** The vine dries up; the fig tree languishes. Pomegranate, palm, and apple, all the trees of the field are dried up, and gladness dries up from the children of man.

1Or *young woman* 2The Hebrew words for *dry up* and *be ashamed* in verses 10–12, 17 sound alike

## *Section Overview*

The prophetic word coming to Judah and Jerusalem from Joel begins with a very brief introduction of the prophet himself. The messenger then recedes into the background as he begins to describe the terrifying invasion by locusts, so drastic that it is to be recounted generation after generation. The people are addressed as if they were all drunkards, virgins, and farmers. They are suffering as the locusts have eliminated all food sources, so much so that even offerings in the temple had to be suspended. There can be no joy in the land, for the harvest has failed completely.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-271-3"></span><span id="page-271-0"></span>1:1 The Lord spoke to prophets in different ways. Some prophets declare that God spoke to them in visions (Isa. 1:1; Ezek. 1:1; Amos 1:1), others directly (Hos. 1:1; Jonah 1:1; Mic. 1:1; Zeph. 1:1; Zech. 1:1). Joel belongs to the latter camp, but in both cases the prophets are clear that they are not the initiators of a message of their own making. They are mediators of God's word.

Little is known about Joel. He simply gives his own name (meaning "Yahweh is God") and that of his father, Pethuel (cf. Introduction). He does not mention where he is from or even the location of his ministry. From the context later in the book, however, it is clear his ministry is to the southern kingdom of Judah, with Jerusalem as his main focus.

1:2–3 The first message of Joel is a call to hear the Lord's word. The verb translated "hear" means more than just to "listen," carrying the implication of to "listen *and* 

<span id="page-272-1"></span>*act* " (the same word is translated as "obey" in Deut. 4:30; Josh. 1:17; Ps. 103:20). Those addressed are "the elders," which may denote simply the older men in the Judean community or possibly those who held responsibility as chosen representatives. The second clause in the verse commands, "give ear," a synonym for "hear," and the message is for "all the inhabitants of the land." Clearly the Lord's word was meant for the entire community of Judah.

The message itself is prefaced by two questions and a command. The questions focus the attention of the people on their present calamity by asking if anything similar to this has ever happened in their time or in any time in the past ("in the days of your fathers"). The command is to tell successive generations about the devastation caused by the locust plague. It is so severe that recollection of it should serve as a warning against turning from the Lord.

<span id="page-272-4"></span><span id="page-272-2"></span>1:4 The invasion of locusts, which in this prophetic foretelling has been going on for some considerable time (cf. 2:25, "the *years* that the swarming locust has eaten"), is described in poetic terms, with a parallelism reinforcing the message. The poetry can be set out like this, using transliteration of the Hebrew terms:

 What the *gazam* left, the *'arbeh* has eaten; what the *'arbeh* has left, the *yeleq* has eaten; what the *yeleq* has left, the *hasil* has eaten.

In translation this becomes:

 What the *cutting locust* left, the *swarming locust* has eaten; what the *swarming locust* left, the *hopping locust* has eaten; what the *hopping locust* left, the *destroying locust* has eaten.

The rarity of these four words in Hebrew makes it impossible to give a precise identification of each.4 While many in the past have allegorized this passage, the indications are that it is referring to an actual locust invasion of Palestine (cf. Introduction: Interpretive Challenges). These are well documented from the past history of the region; in particular, invasion by locusts in plague proportions in Palestine in 1865 and 1915 showed how the region could be devastated by them. God the Creator was using his control of nature to bring judgment on Judah in the form of insect plagues. Just as he used invading nations to express his displeasure with his people, so also he used natural phenomenon to do so (cf. the signs and wonders at the time of the exodus recorded in Ex. 7:14–12:30, or God's threats of using fire as his judgment against the nations in Amos 1:1–2:16).

<span id="page-272-5"></span><span id="page-272-3"></span><span id="page-272-0"></span>1:5–12 The prophetic word is now directed against members of society described as "drunkards," "virgin[s]," and "tillers of the soil." Instead of specific, well-defined groups, it is likely Joel is addressing the society at large using these illustrative terms.

<sup>4</sup> Many understand the terms to describe four stages in the life of a swarm, though some understand this as a reference to four types of locust (cf. the translation).

<span id="page-273-6"></span><span id="page-273-5"></span>1:5–7 The people of Judah are first described as "drunkards" (v. 5). They are called upon to weep and wail because their source of drink is gone ("it is cut off from your mouth"). This is because of the "nation" of locusts coming upon what the Lord calls "my land." While Israel and Judah often thought of the land of Canaan as theirs, in reality it was God's land; they were merely its caretakers. The Lord is depicted as allowing innumerable attackers to come against it, with teeth like lions devouring everything in their path—the grape vines are devastated, and the fig trees have lost their bark. The message is clear: God will send his messengers of judgment, and the pleasures of life, such as wine and figs, will be taken away.

<span id="page-273-7"></span><span id="page-273-0"></span>1:8 The next message begins with a call to lament like a "virgin wearing sackcloth." Sackcloth was a form of dark clothing worn during times of mourning (cf. Gen. 37:34; Isa. 22:12; Amos 8:10); in this case, the mourning is for the "bridegroom of her youth." Once a bride was betrothed, she was regarded as legally having a husband. This scene pictures the death of said husband, leaving the betrothed virgin without the protection and support that marriage entailed. The picture displays the intensity of grief that the nation ought to exhibit.

<span id="page-273-8"></span><span id="page-273-4"></span><span id="page-273-2"></span>1:9 The result of the locust plague is insufficient produce to offer even the normal grain and drink offerings. The Hebrew word for "grain offering" (*minkhah*) was the general term for an offering, but it also bore the specialized meaning of "grain offering." It was normally offered daily alongside a "drink offering" (*nesek*), and hence the combination found here is common in the OT (cf. Ex. 29:40–41; Lev. 23:13; Num. 15:1–10). During famine, these prescribed offerings (Lev. 23:13) could not be made at the "house of the Lord." The word "house" was applied not only to domestic dwellings in the Near East but also to temples (cf. "house of Dagon"; 1 Sam. 5:5). It could be used also of the tabernacle (Ex. 23:19) and later was used, as here, to refer to the temple in Jerusalem.

<span id="page-273-11"></span><span id="page-273-3"></span><span id="page-273-1"></span>Since grain offerings were normally consumed by the priests (cf. Lev. 6:14–18), it is not surprising that the priests are described as mourning their loss of sustenance, although doubtless they were also distressed because their priestly role was largely inactive (cf. Joel 1:13, 16). The term "minister" is virtually a synonym for "priest" in contexts such as these; those who had the special status of priesthood, the Levites, could be designated also as ministers.

<span id="page-273-9"></span>1:10 The state of the countryside is described. So desolate are the fields that they are pictured, in a personified way, as mourning. Indeed, this description uses the same verb used of the priests in the previous verse. This verse simply continues the description of the desolation that has come over the land; grain, wine, and oil are all unavailable because of the devastation.

<span id="page-273-10"></span>1:11 Those who labor at tilling the soil or tending the vineyard have nothing to show for their toil. They planted crops of wheat and barley, but they have no harvest of which to boast. Farmers would have suffered dearly at the hands of such a locust pestilence, demonstrating the life-and-death nature of the threat.

<span id="page-274-1"></span><span id="page-274-0"></span>1:12 The verb translated "dries up" (*hobishah*) includes the same consonants as the verb at the beginning of verse 11 ("be ashamed"; *hobishu*). Both vine and fig tree will fail, depriving the community of food from these sources. The verse concludes by noting that the dryness of the land has as its counterpart the drying up of gladness among the people.

## *Response*

Though the exact date of Joel's prophecy is uncertain, it is similar in many respects to other OT prophecies. First of all, it is a word from the Lord. The prophets were not the originators of their messages but merely the means by which the Lord communicated his word to Israel and Judah. They acted as "covenant enforcement mediators,"5 bringing God's word to his people. In the opening sections of this prophecy such a word is spoken mainly in condemnation, while later the element of hope is also presented.

Second, this opening section of Joel speaks of a God who controls all the forces of nature, including insect plagues. The land was desolate because of the army of locusts, so much so that crops and trees were destroyed and no offerings were available for the Lord.

<span id="page-274-4"></span><span id="page-274-3"></span><span id="page-274-2"></span>Third, this passage reinforces the direct connection between sin and its consequent punishment. Rebellion against God brings as its inevitable sequel divine judgment. Jesus makes this clear in the Sermon on the Mount (cf. Matt. 7:19–20), for sin must be avoided lest we bring ourselves under God's wrath. The same truth is emphasized by Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:27–32, where he warns that abuse of the Lord's Supper brings judgment as a result.

## JOEL 1:13–20

**<sup>13</sup>** Put on sackcloth and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Go in, pass the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God! Because grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.

**<sup>14</sup>** Consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land

<sup>5</sup> The phrase is by Douglas Stuart in Gordon D. Fee and Douglas Stuart, *How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth*, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1993), 167.

 to the house of the Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord.

- **<sup>15</sup>** Alas for the day! For the day of the Lord is near, and as destruction from the Almighty*<sup>1</sup>* it comes. **<sup>16</sup>** Is not the food cut off

1*Destruction* sounds like the Hebrew for *Almighty* 2The meaning of the Hebrew line is uncertain 3Or *are made desolate*

## *Section Overview*

As is so often the case in the Prophetic Books, a call is given to the people to repent and, in appropriate ways, show their heartfelt grief. The people are to gather at the temple (the focal point of worship during the monarchy) to demonstrate sorrow for the judgment that has come upon them. Such sorrow would be demonstrated by fasting and by wearing clothes suitable for mourning. Joel also warns of the potential danger of a special day, "the day of the Lord" (v. 15), that will come with destruction from the Almighty. The people are encouraged to seek God by calling upon him in prayer (vv. 14, 19): when people, cattle, and sheep are all brought to extremes, the only course of action is direct address to God, and the section closes with such a prayer.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-276-16"></span><span id="page-276-13"></span>1:13 The leaders of God's people carried heavy responsibilities; in addition to performing rituals associated with sacrifice, the priests were also responsible for instructing the people (cf. Mal. 2:7: "The lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth"). They are called "ministers of the altar" here because of their special responsibilities at the place of sacrifice, where they are to serve the Lord (cf. "ministers of the Lord"; Joel 1:9). The priests are to "put on sackcloth," the traditional clothing of those in mourning (Gen. 37:34; 2 Sam. 3:31; Job 16:15), and are also called to "lament," a verb often associated with weeping in bereavement (Gen. 23:2; 1 Sam. 25:1; 1 Kings 13:29). They are to mourn because of the absence of grain offerings and drink offerings (cf. Joel 1:9). The relationship of the people to God still continues, however, as the Lord is called "*your* God."

<span id="page-276-8"></span><span id="page-276-2"></span><span id="page-276-1"></span><span id="page-276-0"></span>1:14 Deep sorrow was to be shown in other ways as well, including fasting, which implies self-denial in order to encourage deeper devotion to God and his ways. The only obligatory fast in ancient Israel occurred on the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:29–31; however, after the exile four additional fasts were also instituted—cf. Est. 9:1–32; Zech. 7:3; 8:19). To "consecrate a fast" was to set aside a holy day of fasting, and the parallel phrase, "solemn assembly," reinforces the idea of a formal gathering before the Lord. In such an assembly, the elders and all the people were to "cry out" to their God. This verb is used almost exclusively to describe crying out in time of great need and seeking help when in distress (e.g., Judg. 6:6–7; 1 Sam. 4:13; Jer. 47:2). Corporate prayer to God was what was most needed, just as when Israel gathered over Achan's sin (Josh. 7:13–16) or went up to Bethel to ask who was to lead the fight against the Benjaminites (Judg. 20:18).

<span id="page-276-10"></span><span id="page-276-7"></span><span id="page-276-6"></span><span id="page-276-5"></span><span id="page-276-4"></span><span id="page-276-3"></span>1:15 Suddenly Joel introduces a new concept, "the day of the Lord," with a cry of dismay: "Alas." If Joel's date of writing is early (cf. Introduction: Date and Occasion), this may be one of the earliest occurrences of the important concept of "the day of the Lord." Just as the expression "the day of Midian" (Isa. 9:4) referred to victories achieved there (Judges 6–8), so the expression "the day of the Lord" refers to victories the Lord will achieve. He is the warrior king who overcomes his enemies in dramatic fashion. While earlier passages in the OT did not use the term "the day of the Lord," they nevertheless depicted a day in which God's rule would be celebrated and his righteous judgment executed (Pss. 96:7–13; 98:4–9). It seems that people focused on the aspect of joy but neglected the threat of judgment. Joel, however, warns that "as destruction from the Almighty6 it comes" (Joel 1:15; cf. Isa. 13:6). The destroyer, the Lord, is going to bring destruction.

<span id="page-276-15"></span><span id="page-276-11"></span><span id="page-276-9"></span><sup>6</sup> The Hebrew word for God here is *shadday*. Western European languages typically translate with "Almighty," following the pattern of the Greek and Latin translations, although the literal meaning of *shadday* is obscure.

<span id="page-277-5"></span><span id="page-277-4"></span>1:16 Sorrow and grief were not merely possibilities of the future but were in fact already present in the land. The locust plague had devastated the country, and the house of God, which was meant to be a place of joy (cf. Ps. 122:1–4), had become a place of gloom because of the lack of offerings. A dearth of food led to the absence of joy and gladness.

<span id="page-277-6"></span>1:17 The first part of this verse ("The seed shrivels under the clods") is difficult to translate (cf. ESV mg.), as the three main terms appear only here in the OT. The ESV translation fits the context well (although the presence of a Hebrew suffix could yield "*their* clods"; cf. NKJV, NASB). The picture is of a drought so severe that the ground has dried up into clods, seeds have shriveled beneath them, and storehouses and granaries decay because of disuse.

<span id="page-277-7"></span>1:18 The picture of famine continues, although now cattle and sheep, not humans (v. 16) or crops (v. 17), are in focus. Both herds of cattle and flocks of sheep are distressed because their normal pastures provide no feed. Even when there is no grass for cattle, sheep can survive on roots, but now even that source of food is gone. Just as Israel groaned when under bondage in Egypt (cf. Ex. 2:23), so now the beasts groan in their present distress.

<span id="page-277-10"></span><span id="page-277-8"></span><span id="page-277-0"></span>1:19 Amid such distress, Joel directs his prayer to the redeeming God. The word "call" is a common verb indicating approach to God in prayer, often employed in the fuller expression "to call on the name of the Lord" (cf. 2:32). The order of words, "*to you* . . . I call," emphasizes to whom Joel's cry is made: the prophet knows there is only One who can answer his prayer. The reference to "fire" could be a metaphorical expression denoting the severity of the drought and the absence of fodder. However, it could also refer to literal fires that spread over the barren landscape. "Pastures of the wilderness" and "trees of the field" are parallel expressions indicating how widely the distress has covered the land.

<span id="page-277-9"></span><span id="page-277-3"></span>1:20 The concept of appealing to God is continued with personification of the animals, who are pictured as echoing the prayer of the prophet as they too long for the Lord—the language is very close to Psalm 42:1 ("pant," "water brooks," and "for you" echo "pants," "flowing streams," and "for you"). No streams flow, and even the wilderness, whose pastures often provided some nourishment for cattle and sheep, has been consumed by fire.

## *Response*

<span id="page-277-2"></span><span id="page-277-1"></span>Spiritual leaders fill a very important place in a community as they carry out their role as ministers of God. In the biblical text, true spirituality is expressed in times not only of individual devotion but of communal devotion as well. At various occasions in the OT, the leaders assembled the people to worship the Lord and praise his name (examples include David in 1 Chron. 29:10–13; Solomon in 2 Chron. 1:2–6; Hezekiah in 2 Chron. 30:1–27; Ezra in Neh. 8:1–8). Here Joel instructs the priests and elders of his day to demonstrate leadership in addressing the dire situation in Judah. Communal worship at a time of calamity was meant to direct the people back to God; out of deep need the people were to cry to the Lord, a mark of true spirituality.

<span id="page-278-3"></span><span id="page-278-2"></span><span id="page-278-0"></span>The mission of Joel, as he sought to disabuse the people of his day of their false ideas, came to even greater expression in the ministry of Jesus. In answering a question from his disciples about the end of the age, Jesus warned against being deceived (Matt. 24:4; Mark 13:5). He proceeded to teach about the cataclysmic events that would follow his ascension. Some of the same phenomena Joel and other OT prophets mention—such as the trumpet call and dramatic events in heaven and earth (Isa. 24:17–23; 27:13; Jer. 4:5, 19, 21; Amos 2:2; 3:6)—will precede his own return (Matt. 24:29–31; Mark 13:24–27). The warnings given by Joel become even stronger in the NT as the apostles draw attention to the dangers of sin and encourage preparation in order to be "blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints (1 Thess. 3:13).

## JOEL 2:1–11

<span id="page-278-4"></span><span id="page-278-1"></span>2 Blow a trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming; it is near, **<sup>2</sup>** a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness!

 Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations.

## **<sup>3</sup>** Fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them.

**<sup>4</sup>** Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses they run.

**<sup>5</sup>** As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle.

- **<sup>6</sup>** Before them peoples are in anguish; all faces grow pale.
- **<sup>7</sup>** Like warriors they charge; like soldiers they scale the wall. They march each on his way; they do not swerve from their paths.
- **<sup>8</sup>** They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path; they burst through the weapons and are not halted.
- **<sup>9</sup>** They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief.
- **<sup>10</sup>** The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
- **<sup>11</sup>** The Lord utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the Lord is great and very awesome; who can endure it?

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-279-3"></span>This section begins and ends with mention of a special day, "the day of the Lord" (vv. 1 and 11). A trumpet blast from Zion will alert the people to this day and its surprising features: darkness, fire, and an invading "army" of locusts overrunning their houses. These "warriors" will enter the city without any deviation from their route of attack and will carry out their planned approach with military precision. What was like the garden of Eden will be reduced to desolation. Even heaven and earth will respond to these events as part of the demonstration of God's mighty power, for the day of the Lord will be "very awesome."

## *Comment*

<span id="page-279-2"></span><span id="page-279-1"></span><span id="page-279-0"></span>2:1–2 Blowing the trumpet (*shofar*) was a way of signaling to the people some important happening, whether military (e.g., Judg. 3:27; 2 Sam. 20:1; 1 Kings 1:34) or religious (e.g., Lev. 25:9; Pss. 81:3; 98:6). The role of the prophet could thus be likened to the watchman's use of the *shofar* (Isa. 58:1; Jer. 6:17; Ezek. 33:3–6).

<span id="page-280-8"></span><span id="page-280-0"></span>Here the prophet Joel is announcing the Lord's call that goes out from his holy mountain, Zion (Joel 2:1). While "the mountain of God" refers to Mount Sinai (e.g., Ex. 3:1), "holy mountain" refers to Mount Zion (cf. Pss. 3:4; 43:3; 87:1–2; Isa. 27:13), the mountain God chose for his earthly dwelling place (Ps. 132:13).

<span id="page-280-9"></span><span id="page-280-7"></span><span id="page-280-4"></span><span id="page-280-1"></span>The call is for the people to tremble because of the nearness of the day of the Lord (cf. Joel 1:15). The surprise for them is not merely the day's imminence but also its character (2:2). As in Amos 5:18, the message is that instead of light, the day of the Lord will be characterized by darkness. "Clouds and thick darkness" were associated with God's revelation of himself at Sinai (Ex. 20:21) and later in the temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 8:10–12), but what is coming now is a massive invasion of locusts that will darken the face of the land. Never before has such an episode occurred, nor will it again for generations to come. The description is clearly meant to startle the people, for disaster is rapidly approaching.

<span id="page-280-10"></span><span id="page-280-3"></span><span id="page-280-2"></span>2:3 The reference to fire preceding the invading locusts is difficult to interpret but is probably best understood in relation to other passages in the OT that speak of fire going before the Lord (e.g., Ps. 50:3; Zeph. 1:18). The invading army of locusts is, in fact, both preceded and followed by fire. The picture is thus of desolating judgment transforming a place of beauty into wilderness; total destruction is the lasting effect.

<span id="page-280-13"></span><span id="page-280-12"></span><span id="page-280-11"></span><span id="page-280-6"></span>2:4–5 As the locusts advance, they appear like an army of horsemen and chariots (v. 4). The Hebrew terms for "war horses" (often translated "horsemen") and "chariots" are often paired in descriptions of ancient armies (e.g., Isa. 31:1). The locusts not only resemble horses in general; they share other characteristics of cavalry as well (Joel 2:5). It is not surprising that the noisy locusts are compared to the rumbling chariots of an army or to the noise of a fire as it burns dry vegetation, for they are indeed an army arrayed for battle. This description is echoed in Revelation 9:7, where John writes of locusts arising out of the smoke of the great furnace: "In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle."

<span id="page-280-19"></span><span id="page-280-14"></span><span id="page-280-5"></span>2:6 The people dread the outcome of the invasion, realizing its consequences and reacting accordingly. They are like a woman in travail; the Hebrew verb translated "are in anguish" is often used of labor pains (Isa. 13:8; 23:4; 45:10). The "pale" nature of the people's faces is a possible but uncertain translation, as the adjective occurs only here and in Nahum 2:10. It is generally agreed, however, that the adjective describes some sort of negative reaction to the coming onslaught.

<span id="page-280-18"></span><span id="page-280-17"></span><span id="page-280-16"></span><span id="page-280-15"></span>2:7–9 The following portrayals fit descriptions of human armies, emphasized by the repeated "like . . . like" construction. The locusts resemble soldiers running into battle, climbing walls, and keeping doggedly to the path they have chosen. When invading, they maintain battle order and do not interfere with one other, maintaining their places on the path; tight ranks are kept as they advance (v. 7). Verse 8 reiterates the point that the locusts are not easily diverted from their selected paths, nor do defensive weapons or positions hinder them. Their attack <span id="page-281-4"></span>on the walls is characteristic of locusts, not of human soldiers (v. 9). Once they are on the walls of the city, there is no way they can be stopped. Their access into the city resembles the way thieves enter houses by squeezing through windows.

<span id="page-281-5"></span><span id="page-281-3"></span>2:10 The mass of locusts causes an effect almost like an earthquake; heaven and earth are affected. The description then reverts to the theme of the beginning of this prophecy (v. 2), describing the day of darkness and gloom. The darkness Joel describes can clearly be caused by insect plagues, as there are many firsthand accounts of such phenomena.

<span id="page-281-6"></span>2:11 The Hebrew idiom for uttering one's voice (lit., "the Lord gives his voice") can be used of a variety of situations. In this context, it appears to be a reference to the Lord's voice as the commander of his army, thus making clear that this was his judgment. (At least some of those affected by the locust plague would not have been aware it was the Lord who was directing this massive army.) The reference to the execution of his word is ambiguous. The ESV text ascribes it to the Lord ("he [the Lord] . . . executes his word"), which is probably correct, although it is grammatically possible that it should be understood as referring to the army of locusts carrying out the Lord's will ("it [the locust army] . . . executes his [the Lord's] word"). In either case, it is again clear that the Lord is behind the invasion.

<span id="page-281-8"></span><span id="page-281-2"></span><span id="page-281-1"></span><span id="page-281-0"></span>The concluding words of the verse resemble Amos's reaction to Israel's impending judgment (Amos 7:5). Specific mention of the day of the Lord (already referred to in Joel 2:1) is again introduced. God is often described as "great" (e.g., Neh. 8:6; Jer. 10:6) and "awesome" (e.g., Ex. 15:11; Isa. 64:3), and also as "great and awesome" (Deut. 7:21). It is not surprising, therefore, that this special day can be designated "great and very awesome." The final question—"Who can endure it?"—points to the impossibility of enduring God's wrath as it will be displayed on that great day (for similar use of the verb "endure," cf. Amos 7:10; Mal. 3:2; in the NT, cf. Rev. 6:15–17).

Their preconceptions of the day of the Lord were exposed by the prophet's ministry as he set out God's intentions for the nation. He does not act in secret but reveals his will through "his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). Through the teaching of Scripture, God informs the mind so that his people can be challenged by his Word and respond accordingly. There are many examples in both the OT and the NT of those speaking for God having to disabuse their hearers of false ideas. This was so with Jesus himself (cf. esp. Matt. 5:17–48) and with the apostle Paul (cf. 1 Thess. 4:13–5:11). It is also true that God's judgment does not come unannounced in Scripture. He forewarned in OT times and does so in the NT period as well (e.g., 2 Thess. 1:5–12). We must pay attention to God's messages, both those of kindness and those of severity (Rom. 11:22). The consequences of failure to heed his warnings are severe, for "How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?" (Heb. 2:3).

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-282-0"></span>One of the distinctive features of the prophets is the way they constantly call for repentance and faith. That is what Joel is doing here: encouraging his compatriots to repent of their sin and seek God's favor. That God will be gracious is confirmed by reference to his prior self-declaration of his character at Mount Sinai (Ex. 34:6–7). The people are encouraged to gather in worship and pray that God will spare them, with assurance that true sorrow, demonstrated in a return to obedience to him, will be followed by a cessation of judgment. If such does not happen, God himself will be mocked by the Gentiles.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-283-7"></span>2:12–13 The words "yet even now" translate a Hebrew phrase that includes a particle often serving as a transition marker in the text. The words that follow— "declares the Lord"—point unmistakably to this as a message from God, for they are often used in the prophets as an introduction to authoritative declarations (e.g., Hos. 2:16; Amos 2:11; Mic. 4:6).

<span id="page-283-4"></span>The call is for the people to come back to the Lord, not with mere outward display but with an inner change of heart. No other passage in the OT contains such an instruction regarding rending the heart. Such deep repentance would be linked to several practices associated with grief: fasting, weeping, mourning.

<span id="page-283-6"></span><span id="page-283-1"></span>The sinful people are then reminded yet again that their sovereign Savior is indeed the Lord (cf. "your God," Joel 1:14; "our God," v. 16). He is still the God who revealed himself to Moses as "the Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands" (Ex. 34:6–7). This self-revelation of God became enshrined in the minds of his people and is often echoed in OT books (cf. Num. 14:18; Ps. 86:15; Nah. 1:3; and esp. Jonah 4:2). Here and Jonah 4:2 are the only two passages that quote the creedal formulation of God's character taken from Exodus 34 with the addition, "and he relents over disaster." This clause indicates that God will respond to his people's repentance by relenting from the harm he had purposed for them. This is in keeping with what the Lord promises in Jeremiah 18:7–8, where he makes clear that his announcement of judgment is often made for the purpose of spurring his people toward repentance.

<span id="page-283-9"></span><span id="page-283-8"></span><span id="page-283-5"></span><span id="page-283-3"></span><span id="page-283-2"></span><span id="page-283-0"></span>2:14 The question this verse poses is very similar in both form and content to the question raised in Jonah 3:9 (cf. 2 Sam. 12:22). It is likely a rhetorical device intended to draw attention to the hope that, by means of repentance, disaster could be averted and blessing could result instead. Previously Joel has commented on the absence of grain and drink offerings (Joel 1:9, 13), and now such offerings are cited positively as the content of the promised blessing. This particular element of hope is injected here because a cessation of the locust plague is in view; with a new harvest, these offerings will again be possible. Once more God is called "the Lord, your God" (cf. 2:13). It is not some new deity to whom appeal is made, but Israel's covenantal God, who maintains his relationship with them.

<span id="page-284-11"></span><span id="page-284-10"></span><span id="page-284-8"></span><span id="page-284-4"></span>2:15–17 The prophet's response to the situation is to call the people to prayer (v. 15). The trumpet was important because of its use as a signal in religious, civic, and military affairs. The place where this prayer is to take place is Zion, God's chosen abode (Ps. 132:13), the place to which the ark of the covenant was brought and on which the temple was built. A special fast is to be appointed, as the only obligatory fast for Israel occurred on the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:29, 31). The people are to gather together in a special assembly, called both a "solemn assembly" and a "congregation" (Joel 2:15, 16). No exception is to be made for anyone in Israel; elders and children, young men and old men, bridegroom and bride are all to join in this great gathering, and the priests are to gather as well (v. 17). The "vestibule" was the outer porch of the temple (cf. 1 Kings 6:3; Ezek. 40:7–9), while the altar was the place of sacrifice (cf. Ex. 40:26–27), standing opposite the veiled Most Holy Place. It is there, in that public yet sacred space, that the priests are to offer tearful prayers. The priests are designated as "ministers," a term used in the OT of civil servants (e.g., Gen. 39:4, where Joseph "attended" [i.e., ministered to] Potiphar) but also, as here, of those tasked with representing the people before God (cf. Ex. 28:12, 29).

<span id="page-284-12"></span><span id="page-284-6"></span><span id="page-284-5"></span><span id="page-284-3"></span><span id="page-284-2"></span><span id="page-284-1"></span><span id="page-284-0"></span>The prayer focuses on two things. It is a cry for mercy, asking God to act compassionately toward his erring people. It is also an urgent request for God's people not to become a thing of mockery among the Gentiles. One of the special expressions for God's people was "heritage" or "inheritance" (cf. Ex. 34:9; Deut. 4:20), and this became a basis for appeals to God (Deut. 9:26; Ps. 28:9). For Israel to be a "reproach" was to be a "scorn" or "disgrace," and to be a "byword" was to be a public example, an object lesson, for her neighbors. If God did not show compassion to his own people, they would be taunted for their God's absence from their lives and circumstances. The same general attitude is expressed throughout Psalms 74 and 79.

## <span id="page-284-7"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-284-13"></span><span id="page-284-9"></span>Returning to the Lord is a major theme of the OT prophets, one very closely connected with the covenantal relationship. It was especially prominent among the earlier prophets (for the positive command, cf. Hos. 6:1; 14:1–2; for the negative "you did not return," cf. Amos 4:6, 8, 9, 10, 11), while the later ones may not have used it so often because by then they knew that judgment, in the form of exile, was inevitable. The call to repent presupposes a prior turning away from God and consequently the need to reject sin and return to him.

<span id="page-284-16"></span><span id="page-284-15"></span><span id="page-284-14"></span>The NT expresses the same concept using terms related to "repentance." To repent means to start a new life; its presence is a mark of faith. Frequently in the NT repentance and forgiveness of sins are linked together (Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31). The promise underlying the call to repent is that God is gracious and compassionate and will never turn away a repentant sinner. Jesus' ministry was aimed at calling sinners to repentance (Luke 5:32), and the apostles proclaimed the same message, giving assurance that those repenting would find forgiveness for their sins (Acts 2:38; 26:16–18).

## *Section Overview*

This passage presents another stage in Joel's prophecy. The impending crisis has been described in great detail, and now we see the Lord's response to the prayers of his people. In his grace he has intervened, and the effects of the devastation caused by the locusts will be reversed; the land will enjoy his blessing. The army of locusts will be removed, and once again the land will produce abundant food. Whereas the supply of grain, wine, and oil had been stopped (1:10), now again there will be plenty. This will be an exhibition of the "great things" that only God can perform (2:20–21). Abundant provision will make up for "the years the . . . locust has eaten" (v. 25). Not only will the people have plenty to eat, but they will also engage in thankful acknowledgment of the Lord. At that time there will be no doubting that the Lord is truly the only God, and his people will never again suffer shame (vv. 26–27).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-286-4"></span><span id="page-286-3"></span><span id="page-286-0"></span>2:18–19 God is a jealous God (Ex. 20:5) who has particular love and concern for his people. The verb "became jealous" is parallel to "had pity" (Joel 2:18). The first verb points to an attitude that finds its outward expression in the manner indicated by the second. The sinful nation has not been cast off by God, for its people are still "his people." That same thought is repeatedly expressed by other prophets as well (cf. Isa. 49:25–26; 54:4–9; Jer. 30:1–3; 31:1–6). The words of the Lord depict a restoration of the land to its condition before the locust plague, with crops again yielding grain, wine, and oil. The earlier report of famine that described a lack of such produce (Joel 1:10) is reversed, with assurance given of hunger being satisfied. The presence of God's hand in all that happens is emphasized in the final clause of 2:19. The prayer of the people (v. 17) will be answered, for the Lord in his sovereignty will ensure that the people are no longer mocked by the surrounding Gentile nations. His "heritage" will not become a reproach.

<span id="page-286-5"></span><span id="page-286-2"></span><span id="page-286-1"></span>2:20 The Lord's words for the people continue in this verse. The word translated "northerner" occurs only here in the OT. Many writers have suggested that it refers to an army coming from the north. However, if the references to the locusts earlier in this book are taken literally, then this term most likely relates to that plague as well. Well-documented instances of locusts coming from the north support the continuing interpretation of an insect plague, not an actual army. God, who in his sovereignty brought the locusts, is also the one who will remove them from the land. They will be driven away into the eastern (Dead) and western (Mediterranean) seas, and the dead locusts will emit a powerful stench. The last sentence does not

<span id="page-287-9"></span>indicate who it is that has "done great things." While ancient versions made "the army" the subject of this verb, it is better to link this verse with the following one (v. 21) and understand the subject to be "the Lord," who explicitly is named in that verse. The identical expression occurs elsewhere to describe the Lord's mighty deeds (cf. Ps. 126:2–3).

<span id="page-287-10"></span><span id="page-287-2"></span>2:21–22 These two verses begin with the same standardized expression ("Fear not") found approximately seventy-five times in the OT. The expression is normally followed, as here, by an explanation for the reassurance given. The first occurrence of the expression (v. 21) states that the Lord has done great things; God's intervention on behalf of his people calls forth festive joy. The second identical command (v. 22) specifies particular demonstrations of his favor. The animals will no longer be deprived of food (cf. 1:20) and will enjoy abundant pastures, fruitful trees, and vineyards yielding a plentiful crop.

<span id="page-287-11"></span><span id="page-287-6"></span><span id="page-287-5"></span>2:23 The positive commands of verse 21 are repeated in the plural ("Be glad . . . and rejoice"). To the imperatives is added the object in whom they are to rejoice: "the Lord your God." In spite of their sins, God has not cast away his own covenantal people but is reversing the effects of the plague of locusts. The joy and gladness of which the people were deprived (1:16) are to be restored. The following clause, "He has given the early rain7 for your vindication," declares that the covenantal curse of withheld rain and dew (Lev. 26:18–20; Deut. 28:23–24) is to be annulled, and divine blessing will again be displayed (Lev. 26:3–4; Deut. 11:13–14); both early rain (October/November) and latter rain (March/April) will be restored.

<span id="page-287-14"></span><span id="page-287-13"></span><span id="page-287-12"></span><span id="page-287-4"></span><span id="page-287-1"></span><span id="page-287-0"></span>2:24–25 Restoration means full threshing floors and vats (v. 24). What the locust destroyed (1:5–12) will again be present as a result of God's blessing. None of Joel's listeners or readers should misunderstand how such reversal of fortune is to occur. Just as the Lord is removing the locust plague—his army (2:20, 25)—so also is he restoring former blessings ("*I* will restore"; v. 25). Curse and blessing both come from him. The years of the locust are past,8 and renewal for the land is ahead. This is God's answer and his demonstration of pity for his people (cf. 2:18–19).

<span id="page-287-15"></span><span id="page-287-8"></span>2:26–27 With the locusts gone and regular harvests restored, the message to the people is that their food supply is secure into the future (v. 26). Hunger will be satisfied and the people will be led to praise the name of the Lord, "your God, who has dealt wondrously with you." In spite of Judah's sin, they remained God's people (v. 17), and he their God (vv. 23, 26). The covenantal bond held them together even though judgment had come. With the restoration of God's favor, the people can acknowledge his graciousness in acting so "wondrously" toward them. This

<span id="page-287-7"></span><sup>7</sup> The phrase translated "early rain" has spawned various interpretations. Some early versions (Targum, Old Latin, Syriac) understood the Hebrew to refer to a person, "the teacher of righteousness," while others probably had a different Hebrew text, rendering the term using a word denoting "food" (LXX). On balance, the ESV text should stand, an interpretation supported by the NKJV, NASB, NIV, and NRSV.

<span id="page-287-3"></span><sup>8</sup> The reference to specific species of locusts uses the same terms as in 1:4 (cf. comment there), although in a slightly different order.

expression contains a Hebrew term used mainly of God in the OT and conveys the idea that wondrous or surprising things belong to him (for similar passages, cf. Deut. 28:59; Judg. 13:19; Isa. 29:15). Marvels of love are his alone (cf. Ps. 31:21).

<span id="page-288-4"></span><span id="page-288-3"></span>Another effect of the restored fortunes is that Judah will not be forced to suffer shame. This refers not to inner feelings of shame but to public disgrace, parallel to not being a "reproach among the nations" (Joel 2:19). The outcome for Judah will be genuine understanding of the Lord's presence in their midst (v. 27). The declaration "I am the Lord your God and there is none else" is very close to Isaiah 45:22, "I am God, and there is no other." Personal experience of God's grace and power convince that he is unique. The words at the end of the previous verse are repeated exactly at the end of Joel 2:27 to form a refrain exalting the fact that Judah will be subject to derision no longer.

<span id="page-288-12"></span><span id="page-288-1"></span>What compassion God shows to his erring children! "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things" (Heb. 1:1–2). Joel was among those prophets who spoke God's word. With judgment pending, he appealed to the people to repent and turn to God again. The use of Exodus 34:6–7 in Joel 2:13 is a poignant reminder of an incident of grave rebellion against God (the golden calf) that was followed by God's forgiveness. God's people in every age and location are a witness to the world, and repentance is required if they fail to live truly as his people. The call to the church at Ephesus, "Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first" (Rev. 2:5), is a constant reminder to Christian believers that if they fail to meet God's standards, they must confess and seek God's pardoning mercy when confronted by their sin.

<span id="page-288-13"></span><span id="page-288-7"></span><span id="page-288-6"></span><span id="page-288-5"></span>Repentance on the people's part will result in divine intervention on the Lord's part. The stress in this section of Joel's prophecy is on God's mercy to Judah, called here the "children of Zion" (Hb. "sons of Zion"; Joel 2:23). Sorrow is turned to joy when God overturns opposing forces. He assures his people that he is able to do great things for them (v. 21), to act wondrously on behalf of those who trust in him (v. 26). The concluding verse of the section picks up on an important theme from the book of Exodus. The Lord's promise was that he would dwell with Israel and that they would know he was the one who had redeemed them from Egypt (Ex. 29:45–46). Now the assurance is given again that God, their God, the only God, is in their midst (Joel 2:27). Gracious promises from God enable us to enjoy peace of heart and mind and cause us to praise the name of our Savior.

The gospel brings assurance that he is in the midst of his people still (2 Cor. 6:16) and will be so to the end of the age (Matt. 28:20).

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-289-1"></span><span id="page-289-0"></span>Further information is given concerning the coming day of the Lord. The Spirit will be poured out (emphasized by repeated mention in vv. 28 and 29), dispensing transforming power on young and old, man and woman. Again (cf. vv. 1–2, 10), mention is made of the darkness associated with the day of the Lord. Yet, amid such darkness and distress, those who call on the name of the Lord will be saved. The escapees from Zion will be those whom the Lord calls, even as he promised.

## *Section Outline*

IV.C. The Outpouring of the Spirit (2:28–32)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-289-4"></span><span id="page-289-2"></span>2:28–29 The time frame for the coming events is "afterward," a general expression modified to "in the last days" by Peter in his quotation of this passage on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:17). Because the events spoken of in the previous section are near at hand, Joel's use here of "afterward" indicates the events of this section should not be expected until later. This promise will be fulfilled far outside his own time.9

<span id="page-289-5"></span><sup>9</sup> This may also explain why Peter can quote Joel but change "afterward" to "in the last days": that later time has now arrived (Acts 2:19)!

<span id="page-290-5"></span><span id="page-290-1"></span>The promise is that the Spirit will be poured out indiscriminately—"on all flesh" (Joel 2:28). The Hebrew word for "spirit" (*ruakh*) has a range of meaning (wind, breath, spirit), including reference to the Spirit of God/the Lord (e.g., 1 Kings 18:12; 2 Kings 2:16; Ezek. 37:1), the Holy Spirit (Ps. 51:11; Isa. 63:10, 11). This passage should be compared to other Prophetic Books in which notification is given of a coming eschatological day on which God's Spirit will be poured out abundantly (cf. Ezek. 39:29; Zech. 12:10). The effect of this outpouring, says Joel, will be communication of knowledge to young and old, male and female. In contrast to the limited group of people to whom God revealed himself in OT times, he will now reveal himself much more fully to all his people. No one will be left out. In verse 29, Joel speaks for the second time of the Spirit being poured out, this time on male and female servants. These words for "servants" include foreign slaves who were either captured in battle or sold by their captors. Hence even Gentile slaves were to be blessed by a sudden and dramatic outpouring of God's Spirit.

<span id="page-290-10"></span><span id="page-290-8"></span><span id="page-290-2"></span><span id="page-290-0"></span>2:30–31 The coming of supernatural events is described in imagery taken from the account of the signs and wonders at the time of the exodus from Egypt. "Wonders" translates a Hebrew word often used in parallel with another term meaning "signs" or "portents" (Deut. 4:34; 7:19; 29:3) and at times in conjunction with "judgments" (1 Chron. 16:12; Ps. 105:5). The use of the exodus account here is no surprise, as the prophets utilize it both to describe the coming salvation realized in the return from exile (Isa. 43:16–21; 51:9–11; Jer. 16:14–15) and to warn of impending divine judgment (Hos. 13:4–8; Nah. 1:2–5). As at the exodus, the "signs" are not merely demonstrations of God's power but also portents of the salvation he will accomplish for his people.

<span id="page-290-15"></span><span id="page-290-14"></span><span id="page-290-13"></span><span id="page-290-11"></span><span id="page-290-9"></span><span id="page-290-6"></span><span id="page-290-4"></span>Both earth and sky will manifest these wonders (Joel 2:30). In the heavens, the sun will cease to shed light and instead will be dark, while the moon will become blood (v. 31). Possibly, in light of Peter's use of these words on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:16–21), the prophet is predicting the convulsion of nature that began on the day Jesus was crucified (Luke 23:44–45). Jesus also predicted that similar events would occur before the end of the age (Luke 21:11). This verse picks up the earlier description in Joel 2:11 of a "great and very awesome" day; this day is among the events that will manifest the greatness of God and cause spectators to stand in awe of him. In Revelation, John echoes such passages when referring to impending judgment (cf. Rev. 8:12).

<span id="page-290-16"></span><span id="page-290-12"></span><span id="page-290-7"></span><span id="page-290-3"></span>2:32 Two types of calling are mentioned in this verse. The first is that of people calling upon the name of the Lord, resulting in salvation. The catastrophic events set out in the previous verses will be part of God's judgment. Deliverance from such judgment will be shared by those who approach God in prayer, seeking his intervention and help. To "call on the name of the Lord" is a frequent OT expression, especially in the Psalms (e.g., Pss. 105:1; 116:4, 13, 17). The second calling in this verse is the Lord's calling of those who have escaped the coming disaster ("those whom the Lord calls"). At the heart of the kingdom of Judah will be those in Mount Zion and Jerusalem whom the Lord will call. Such a calling by God always brings his purposes to fulfillment.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-291-1"></span><span id="page-291-0"></span>Many of God's statements concerning his future actions are similar to this one, referencing a gap between a prophecy and its fulfillment. The prophet simply states, "It shall come to pass afterward" (2:28). This lack of precision regarding future dates is typical of both OT and NT prophecies (cf. Isa. 7:18–25; Amos 9:13–15; Matt. 24:1–14; 1 Thess. 4:13–18). Expectation is an important element in the lives of believers, but knowing ahead of time the precise date of a future event would lessen such expectation, as well as the resolve to be ready lest we get caught unprepared.

<span id="page-291-4"></span><span id="page-291-3"></span>The imagery of "pouring out" is a reminder that God acts in a bountiful way toward his people. While "pouring" usually refers to inanimate objects as recipients of God's actions, here the objects are people. God does not act in a stingy way but pours out his grace. The promise given through Joel's ministry is that God will lavish his saving grace on those who call upon him, and who then display by their actions that they are those whom God has called. Paul's use of this passage when writing about the proclamation of the gospel (Rom. 10:13) assists our understanding of it. In that context, this calling on the name of the Lord is equated with believing from the heart that Jesus is Lord.

## JOEL 3:1–8

<span id="page-291-2"></span>3 *<sup>1</sup>* "For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, **<sup>2</sup>** I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land, **<sup>3</sup>** and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it.

**<sup>4</sup>** "What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily. **5**For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.*<sup>2</sup>* **<sup>6</sup>**You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own border. **7**Behold, I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will return your payment on your own head. **<sup>8</sup>** I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away, for the Lord has spoken."

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-292-5"></span>Before speaking of wonders in store for Judah and Jerusalem, Joel describes a future judgment of the nations. God's rule over them is a theme often introduced by the prophets, and here Joel depicts the administration of God's justice specifically on the Philistines and on Tyre and Sidon. These two cities were independent but at times allied with the Philistines (Jer. 47:4). This judgment is primarily because of their attitude and actions toward God's people. They had scattered his flock and broken up their unity by dispersing them among the nations. These events had already taken place, but insufficient detail prevents any specific identification of them.

```
1. Forced Exile Repaid (3:1–8)

## *Comment*

<span id="page-292-7"></span><span id="page-292-4"></span>3:1 Joel's presentation begins with a time reference: "For behold, in those days and at that time . . ." These phrases appear also in Jeremiah 33:15; 50:4, 20 and are always linked to future blessing and promised consolation for God's people. The promise is of restoration of fortunes, which in similar contexts implies restoration from captivity (cf. similar expressions in Deut. 30:3; Ps. 126:1; Amos 9:14). Thus this expression is tied to the reference to the scattered people of God in the next verse; the desolation of Judah and Jerusalem is to be reversed.

<span id="page-292-10"></span><span id="page-292-9"></span><span id="page-292-8"></span><span id="page-292-1"></span>3:2–3 The nations are to be assembled for judgment in the "Valley of Jehoshaphat" (v. 2). No known place bearing this name has been identified, but the phrase was clearly understood to refer to a place of judgment. The name "Jehoshaphat" means "Yahweh judges," and the very next phrase—"I will enter into judgment with them"—contains the same verb ("to judge"). What is more, this valley is later called "the valley of decision" (v. 14). The judgment, as God declares, is "on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel" (v. 2). This connects to the prayers of the priests mentioned in 2:17 and the statement in 2:18 that God was jealous for his land and pitied his people Israel. This is essentially an application of the principle stated in the covenant with Abraham: whoever dishonors Abraham and his descendants will be cursed by God (Gen. 12:3).

<span id="page-292-6"></span><span id="page-292-3"></span><span id="page-292-2"></span><span id="page-292-0"></span>Several reasons are given for this judgment against the nations. The first is that they are responsible for the dispersion of Israel. This is not necessarily a reference to the fall of Jerusalem, for at various other times captives were also taken. One such example is the Israelite girl who was taken captive by the Syrians to work for Naaman's wife (2 Kings 5:1–5). A second reason relates to a loss of the territorial integrity of Judah's land, claimed here by God as "my land" but divided up and apportioned among invaders. The casting of lots to apportion the land was clearly acceptable when done by God's people (Joshua 14–19), but not when done

by enemy nations. The third reason is that human life was regarded so lightly that young men could be traded for the use of a prostitute and a young girl sold in payment for wine.

<span id="page-293-3"></span><span id="page-293-1"></span>3:4 The question that begins this verse asks what the peoples of Tyre and Sidon and of Philistia have against the Lord. Tyre and Sidon were Phoenician seaports (situated on the southern Mediterranean coast of present-day Lebanon), while the Philistines (from the Mediterranean coastal strip south of modern Joppa) bedeviled Israel and Judah for centuries, at least to the time of Ahaz (cf. Isa. 9:8–12). Swift retribution is threatened against these groups if their opposition is intended as payback for deeds done by the Lord or his people.

<span id="page-293-10"></span><span id="page-293-4"></span>3:5 The offense of Tyre, Sidon, and the Philistines is their theft of Israelite/Judean gold, silver, and "rich treasures." These belonged to the Lord, though it need not be presumed they were temple valuables, as all the wealth of the land was his (cf. Hag. 2:8). In any case, the invaders took them and placed them in their sacred places, temples, and/or palaces, and the use of the Lord's property in heathen worship or human revelry was a mockery of their intended purpose.

3:6 The enemies of God's people also sold to the Greeks (lit., "the sons of Yavan") captives taken from Judah and Jerusalem. That this was trade *in humans* is brought out in the Hebrew text by the repetition of the word "sons of": "*sons of* Judah and *sons of* Jerusalem" (AT). While there has been much discussion concerning the word "Yavan," the translators of the LXX clearly thought it was a reference to Greece, translating it as *hellas*. The loss of able-bodied Israelites would weaken Judah, and sending them as far away as Greece would ensure they could not return in the future to confront the enemies of God's people. Amos similarly accuses the Philistines and the Phoenicians of being involved in the slave trade (Amos 1:6, 9).

<span id="page-293-9"></span><span id="page-293-7"></span><span id="page-293-2"></span><span id="page-293-0"></span>3:7–8 The good news for Judah and Jerusalem is that God will soon stir up those who have been sold into slavery. The verb "stir" is frequently used of God in the OT, especially to denote his sovereign actions in rousing people to act in ways that fulfill his will (cf. Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, 1 Chron. 5:26; the Babylonians, Ezek. 23:22–23; the Medes, Isa. 13:17). His people will be aroused from their exilic slumber, with the implication that they will be brought home. By doing so, God will recompense the Philistines and the Phoenicians for their action in selling his people to distant lands (Joel 3:7). God's judgment will go further, in fact, as the Philistines and the Phoenicians will lose their sons and daughters (cf. comment on the use of "sons" in 3:6) to the people of Judah, who will in turn sell them to the Sabeans, "a nation far away" (v. 8).

<span id="page-293-8"></span><span id="page-293-6"></span><span id="page-293-5"></span>The term "Sabeans" denotes the people of Sheba, a country probably situated near present-day Yemen. Those who shipped captives far off will themselves be subjected to the same fate. The geographical aspects of this prophecy are significant. While slaves from Judah had been sold off to the north, now men of Judah will be involved in sending off slaves in the opposite direction, to the far southeast, as <span id="page-294-0"></span>fulfillment of the covenantal curse—now applied to Judah's enemies!—of being scattered among the nations (Lev. 26:33; Deut. 28:64).

<span id="page-294-2"></span>This section concludes with the declaration, "for the Lord has spoken." These words, found also in Obadiah 18, are an assertion of the divine origin of Joel's message. Joel was the messenger; the message itself came from the Lord.

## *Response*

God has always been committed to the welfare of his people. In Joel's day the people needed reassurance. They faced a severe crisis in the locust plague and had suffered incursions into their territory and the removal of fellow citizens, men and women, to places as far away as Greece. Displacing conquered people was a cruel process, widely practiced in the ancient Near East. But now Joel's message reminds those of Judah and Jerusalem that their God is sovereign—not only over them and their territory but over other countries as well. He is also a just God who will bring judgment on those who act so unrighteously against his people. This truth is a constant source of comfort to believers who may suffer unjustly; they have the assurance that in the end God's righteous rule will prevail. The song of the twenty-four elders in Revelation is a reminder that God has taken his "great power and begun to reign," and he will both reward his servants and destroy "the destroyers of the earth" (Rev. 11:17–18). The book of Revelation also depicts the role Jesus will have in the judgment process. He will act in righteousness toward the unbelieving nations and in doing so will proclaim that he is "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Rev. 19:11–16).

1Or *Consecrate a war*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-295-6"></span><span id="page-295-0"></span>The confrontation between God and the nations is announced by calling upon the nations' warriors to prepare for battle. Their preparations include making swords from plows and spears from pruning hooks. This is the reversal of the imagery of Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3. The nations are to come to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, twice called "the valley of decision" (Joel 3:14), and face the Lord's justice in full force. The day of the Lord will be marked by darkness, with no light visible from the sun, moon, or stars. Again the Lord will roar from Zion (cf. the earlier reference to the trumpet sound in 2:1), and his thundering voice will cause earth and sky to tremble. However, a marked contrast is drawn concerning the people of God. To his and his people's enemies the Lord will be the supreme judge, while to his own he will be both a refuge and a stronghold.

IV.D.2. The Lord Roars from Zion (3:9–16)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-295-5"></span><span id="page-295-4"></span><span id="page-295-3"></span><span id="page-295-1"></span>3:9–10 The theme of judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat (cf. v. 2) is taken up again, with the call being issued to the Gentile nations to gather together and prepare for war. The term "consecrate" (v. 9) has already been used in 1:14 to call the people together in solemn assembly. Now the Lord again issues a call that may continue to bear religious overtones. All due preparations, perhaps including offering sacrifices, must be completed. Once again the verb "stir" (cf. 3:7) is used, this time of mighty warriors, men of war called to "come up" (v. 9). The nations are to

<span id="page-296-0"></span>prepare for battle, and hence the instruction is given for plowshares and pruning hooks to become weapons of war (v. 10). This is a reversal of the message of Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3. Even the weakling must declare himself ready for battle, asserting, "I am a warrior" (Joel 3:10).

<span id="page-296-10"></span><span id="page-296-9"></span>3:11 No time is to be lost in gathering together "there," a place identified in the following verse as the Valley of Jehoshaphat. This gradual introduction of the place where judgment will be administered is similar to how Isaiah only gradually announces that it will be the Assyrians who come and attack Judah (Isa. 5:26–7:25). In both cases, expectation is aroused before the identification is clarified.

<span id="page-296-11"></span><span id="page-296-1"></span>There is a sudden switch in Joel 3:11b to a call for the Lord to bring his "warriors" down. This is virtually a prayer by the prophet himself. No information is given to enable the reader to discern who these warriors are. It has been suggested that they are the angelic host, but a different interpretation is preferable, as the context (vv. 9–12) suggests a battle of human forces in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. In any case, the Lord is beseeched to bring together his forces, whether human or angelic, to participate in the judgment of the nations.

<span id="page-296-12"></span><span id="page-296-8"></span><span id="page-296-7"></span><span id="page-296-4"></span>3:12 This verse is central to this section of the prophecy. The call to the nations has been given (vv. 9–11). Now the judgment scene is set, similar to that described in Daniel 7:9–10. Though the Gentile nations are assembling their forces, no threat can be made against the Lord and his forces, for he sits on the judgment throne. Once again (cf. v. 7) the verb "stir" is used of the nations as they make their military preparations, but in coming to the Valley of Jehoshaphat they are approaching their own doom.

<span id="page-296-13"></span><span id="page-296-6"></span><span id="page-296-3"></span><span id="page-296-2"></span>3:13 The metaphor changes as the Lord calls his servants, the warriors, to swing the sickle and reap the harvest. Both the OT and the NT use this metaphor to depict divine judgment (cf. Isa. 63:1–6; Matt. 13:36–43; and esp. Rev. 14:14–20). However, only here and in Jeremiah 51:33 does the grain harvest serve as a negative image. Further, as the grain crops are ripe, so are the grapes. Just as the reapers can bring in the sheaves, so treaders can press out the grapes in the overflowing vats. The last line of the verse emphasizes that the iniquity of the nations is great, and for this reason the Lord's judgment is at hand.

<span id="page-296-14"></span><span id="page-296-5"></span>3:14 The scene moves on to the final judgment itself, and although the Valley of Jehoshaphat is not mentioned again (cf. vv. 2, 12), the context requires it to be identified with the new term, "the valley of decision." The Hebrew word for "decision" may contain a play on words; it can mean both a legal judgment and also something dug out or excavated. Perhaps the latter meaning is more to the point here, referring to a deep valley. The word translated "multitudes" can mean a large crowd but also conveys the idea of uproar or commotion. Both ideas are probably intended here, as the nations are jumbled together in this valley as they await the final verdict from the Lord, whose day is "near."

<span id="page-297-6"></span><span id="page-297-3"></span><span id="page-297-2"></span>3:15 No actual description of the destruction of God's enemies is given. Instead, accompanying phenomena are presented to indicate the cosmic dimensions of God's judgment. The wording is identical to 2:10, where it describes the locust plague as the heavenly bodies fail to fulfill their function of giving light. The account in Matthew 27:45 records what happened when Jesus bore the judgment of God for his people on the cross: "Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour." Darkness is an appropriate manifestation of God's judgment.

<span id="page-297-5"></span><span id="page-297-4"></span><span id="page-297-1"></span>3:16 Several OT prophets depict the Lord roaring in judgment to indicate a divine visitation about to take place. This is especially true of those prophesying in the eighth century BC (cf. Isa. 31:4; Hos. 5:14; Amos 3:4, 8; the language here is identical to that in Amos 1:2). Like a lion roaring before it attacks, the Lord is providing a warning from Zion, thundering from Jerusalem. The Hebrew idiom "utters his voice" is to be understood as denoting thunder. Rather than Jerusalem and Zion being places of safety, they are the sources from which the judgments originate.

The latter part of the verse begins with a strong adversative, "*But* the Lord." These descriptions of God as "refuge" and "stronghold" are both common OT expressions; by acting in judgment on behalf of his people, the Lord demonstrates the security he affords them. The use of the divine name, "the Lord" (*Yahweh*), is also noteworthy, for he is speaking to "his people," "the people of Israel." This last term is significant, for although the northern tribes had arrogated to themselves an exclusive claim to the title "Israel," here Judah is recognized as still being part of the true nation.

#### *Response*

The consistent biblical message is that when people turn from the living God and fail to live up to the standards he has set, they can be sure to face a final reckoning with him. Every judgment of God recorded in the OT is a precursor to that final great judgment.

Another significant component of biblical teaching that finds support in Joel's prophecy is the link between God's judgment on sinners and the salvation of his people. Judgment and redemption are two sides of God's intervention on their behalf. The confidence of God's people rests in his character, for he is a "refuge" and a "stronghold" for them. Words such as these convey important concepts of what God is to those who trust in him. He is the keeper of Israel (Ps. 121:4, 5, 7).

<span id="page-297-10"></span><span id="page-297-9"></span><span id="page-297-8"></span><span id="page-297-7"></span><span id="page-297-0"></span>The NT gives us, in Jesus' own words, the confidence that he is the Good Shepherd who knows his sheep and keeps them unto eternal life (John 10:1–18). In his special prayer to his Father he assures all who come to him that they will be protected and kept safe (John 17:12). The NT message is that whenever God begins a good work in the heart and life of a believer, he will carry on and complete that work (Phil. 1:6). That work includes keeping believers from falling and ultimately presenting them without fault before God's presence (Jude 24).

## JOEL 3:17–21

<span id="page-298-2"></span>**<sup>17</sup>** "So you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-298-0"></span>This concluding section of Joel's prophecy focuses on blessing for Judah and Jerusalem. The opening verse picks up on a theme already introduced in 2:27, namely, knowledge of the God of the covenant, and ties it to the thought at the end of the previous section. Having chosen Zion, God will set it apart for himself, and from that mountain blessing will flow like water gushing from a spring. While traditional enemies such as Egypt and Edom will become desolate, Judah will continue to be inhabited, for the Lord has taken up his symbolic presence in Zion.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-298-1"></span>3:17 Earlier in the prophecy (2:27), the Lord had assured the people that they would have certain knowledge of him and would understand that he was in their midst. "I am the Lord your God" is repeated in exactly the same form here as another reaffirmation of self-identification and personal identity. The Lord declares that he "dwells in Zion." This phraseology was significant for the people, and from the verb "to dwell" came the primary name for the tabernacle, *mishkan*. The Lord's holiness was associated with the tabernacle/temple, situated as it was on Mount Zion, the location described by God as "my holy mountain."

<span id="page-299-3"></span>The consequence of this was that Jerusalem as a whole would be regarded as holy. It was the place where God symbolically resided, although foreigners were permitted to come and worship at the temple (1 Kings 8:41–43). The reference to strangers' "never again pass[ing] through it" is probably not a reference to that provision but rather a declaration that foreign armies would never again conquer the city. The unique character of Jerusalem will be protected.

<span id="page-299-7"></span><span id="page-299-6"></span>3:18 A vision of a complete change in the city's physical surroundings is introduced by the phrase "in that day." This is part of the terminology used by the prophets to speak of days to come. "In that day" and "in those days" are indefinite expressions used by the prophets to depict time in the future without giving sufficient details to pinpoint with accuracy the chronology of the events (cf. Response section on 2:28– 32). Joel depicts future blessing for Judah by describing a time when wine and milk will be in abundance and dry streams will again flow. From a fountain in the temple, water will flow to the "Valley of Shittim." This valley cannot be identified today, but as Shittim is elsewhere mentioned as being opposite Jericho, on the eastern bank of the Jordan, it is probably a reference to that area (cf. Num. 33:49; Josh. 2:1; Mic. 6:5).

<span id="page-299-10"></span><span id="page-299-8"></span><span id="page-299-4"></span><span id="page-299-2"></span>3:19 Two old enemies of Judah will be judged. Egypt was the old enslaving enemy, whose treatment of Israel could never be forgotten. Edom's people were descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, and while earlier in the OT Edom and Israel appeared to have been comparatively friendly with each other, in later periods the prophets invoked curses against her, implying she had been hostile to Israel (cf. Jer. 49:7–22; Amos 1:11–12; Obadiah; Mal. 1:2–5). Joel depicts a reversal of fortunes for these nations descended from two brothers. While Judah had become a "desolate wilderness" under the locust plague (Joel 2:3), her enemy will be reduced to the same situation (the Hebrew word is identical in both verses), for they had shed innocent blood during attacks perpetrated against Judah. (Not enough information is given to identify with precision the specific violence against Judah by Egypt and Edom that are in view here.)

<span id="page-299-9"></span><span id="page-299-5"></span>3:20 God's blessing on his people will be shown in the constant habitation of Judah and Jerusalem. The promise is "forever" (*leʻolam*) and "to all generations" (*ledor wador*). Neither of these expressions necessarily means "eternally." "Forever" is used in contexts in the OT that indicate it could mean "for a lifetime" (cf. its use in Ex. 21:6 in reference to a slave who loved his master and did not want to go free).10

<span id="page-299-1"></span><span id="page-299-0"></span><sup>10</sup> Expressions involving the word "generation" also can be used in parallel to "forever" and understood similarly; cf. Exodus 12:14; 27:21; Leviticus 3:17.

<span id="page-300-0"></span>It is also used in at least one covenantal context to refer to a promise that would be continually experienced, provided the one to whom it was made remained faithful to the covenant (1 Sam. 2:30). Here the promise is meant to encourage the Israelites; it is an assurance that the Lord will be continually faithful to his covenant.

<span id="page-300-5"></span>3:21 The first part of this verse has vexed translators as far back as the Greek and Syriac translations. The ESV rendering, "I will avenge their blood, blood I have not avenged," makes good sense in light of the context (cf. v. 19). The assurance is that blood that has not yet been avenged will be avenged in the future, for God ensures that the guilty will not go unpunished.

The final clause, "for the Lord dwells in Zion," ties the section together, echoing the phrase "the Lord your God, who dwells in Zion" in verse 17. The closing section of the prophecy thus focuses on how the dwelling of the Lord in the temple in Jerusalem ought to reassure his people. He is there in their midst and will continue to be a "stronghold to the people of Israel" (v. 16).

## <span id="page-300-4"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-300-2"></span>How comforting this final section of the prophecy would have been for Joel's listeners and readers as he pointed to a glorious future for Judah and Jerusalem, even promising that they would be perpetually inhabited. This is not the only passage in the OT that makes such a statement (cf. Isa. 60:19–22; Jer. 31:38–40). Joel's ministry took place in difficult days for Judah, seemingly without significant events to bring him cheer. We know so little of what was transpiring in the spiritual life of the people to whom he ministered. But the final message of Joel is immensely rich. God had not forgotten his own people but was still in their midst (2:27; 3:17, 21). This was a reassertion of the truth that "the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage" (Ps. 94:14).

<span id="page-300-9"></span><span id="page-300-8"></span><span id="page-300-7"></span><span id="page-300-6"></span><span id="page-300-3"></span><span id="page-300-1"></span>The thought of the Lord dwelling with his people also points forward to a greater fulfillment. The tabernacle was his *mishkan*, his dwelling place, and as such it found fulfillment in the coming of the Lord Jesus. The Word became flesh and tabernacled with us (John 1:14) when Jesus humbled himself and took on human form (Phil. 2:7–8). The message of Joel and other prophets must now be seen in the light of the ministry of our Lord. He came not to be ministered to but to minister to others and "to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45). For those who trust in him, he is the refuge and stronghold of whom Joel and others prophesied.

## INTRODUCTION TO

# AMOS

## *Overview*

<span id="page-303-2"></span><span id="page-303-0"></span>The book of Amos delivers a resounding message from God to Israel regarding judgment coming against the northern kingdom for its sin. The Lord roars like a lion from Zion, declaring through the prophet his message of condemnation of the people. God can no longer tolerate the idolatry, hypocrisy, social injustice, and complacency of his chosen nation. Amos 3:2 sums up the central message of the book: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." The point is clear: the Lord's distinct grace toward Israel makes its infidelity especially reprehensible. The prophet thus preaches a series of messages that both indict Israel for its sin and descriptively convey the impending doom.

<span id="page-303-5"></span><span id="page-303-4"></span>Although Amos preaches a message of destruction, the devastation that God would bring is not the last word. The book ends with a promissory note of mercy and restoration. God loves his people and remains faithful to his covenant, particularly his oath to David (9:11). He promises a day is coming in which he will save a remnant and restore the fortunes of his people (9:11–15). This concluding statement of hope provides assurance to believers: God has not forgotten his promise to be merciful to those who call upon him.

## *Title and Author*

<span id="page-303-3"></span>The name of the book derives from the prophet Amos. He was a shepherd (1:1), a self-professed herdsman and "dresser of sycamore figs" (7:14), with apparently no formal training in the prophetic ministry (7:14). He resided in Tekoa, a town just south of Jerusalem. Though apparently from Judah, he was called to minister in the northern kingdom of Israel. There is no mention of his family or genealogy, and no mention of Amos outside of this book.

### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-303-1"></span>The length of time during which Amos ministered is uncertain, but the superscription of the book provides some information to aid in dating his ministry. Amos 1:1 notes that he served sometime during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (792–740 BC), and Jeroboam II, king of Israel (793–753). This indicates that <span id="page-304-0"></span>Amos was among the earliest of the writing prophets.1 We also know that Amos's ministry occurred "two years before the earthquake" (1:1). Determining when this particular earthquake took place has been a challenge for modern scholars, but the initial audience would apparently have been familiar with this exceptional event.

During the reign of Jeroboam II, the northern kingdom of Israel (as well as Judah) experienced a burgeoning of wealth and success unparalleled by any other period in Israel's history. Much of this growth was due to the political landscape of the time. Between 805 and 796 BC, the Assyrian king Adad-nari III gained control over much of Syria. However, this control was short-lived, as Assyria became occupied on its northern and western borders with other military confrontations. It was not until the ascent of Tiglath-pileser III to the Assyrian throne in 743 BC that the empire's control over the ancient Near East began to grow.2 This allowed great latitude and occasion for Israel during the time of Jeroboam II to flourish in trade and commerce amid the power vacuum formed by Assyria's lack of dominance.

The prosperous economic climate in Israel unfortunately provided fertile ground for apostasy and immorality to flourish. Syncretism became prevalent as Israelite worship mixed with surrounding pagan practices. Other deities were venerated in the belief that the blessings experienced by their worshipers came from these false gods. The material comforts enjoyed by the people led to great complacency, as very little concern was expressed over the immorality and social injustice pervading the nation. Amos addressed and condemned each of these issues as violations of the nation's covenant with God (2:6–8; 5:10–12; 8:4–6). He declared that the Lord's judgment was coming for the northern kingdom of Israel, as God saw their deeds and would bring them to account. Israel would face destruction, and the Assyrian captivity (722 BC) served as the consequence of their unfaithfulness. However, Israel was not the sole object of God's wrath; Judah would also pay for its sins, as would other nations for theirs (1:3–2:3).

<span id="page-304-6"></span><span id="page-304-3"></span><span id="page-304-2"></span><span id="page-304-1"></span>In wrath, however, God remembered mercy (Hab. 3:2). The concluding chapter of Amos highlights the Lord's faithfulness to his covenant promises, even in light of his people's unfaithfulness. Though Israel would be destroyed, God would raise up "the booth of David" and rebuild it (Amos 9:11). A remnant would experience restoration, and eternal blessings would come to Israel (vv. 13–15). The Lord himself would restore the fortunes of his people (v. 14).

### <span id="page-304-5"></span><span id="page-304-4"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

Amos was clearly a gifted preacher and writer. As James Mays notes, "No prophet surpasses him in the combination of purity, clarity, and versatility that charac-

<sup>1</sup> Other writing prophets who began their ministry during the eighth century include Hosea (c. 750 BC), Isaiah (c. 740 BC), and Micah (c. 735 BC).

<sup>2</sup> Assyria would eventually conquer Damascus and Israel (with the fall of Samaria coming in 722 BC) and subjugate Judah to the status of a vassal nation. For further discussion on ancient Near Eastern history as it relates to Israel, cf. John Bright, *A History of Israel* (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2000), 269–309; Eugene H. Merrill, *Kingdom of Priests: A History of Old Testament Israel* (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2008), 405–443; Iain Provan, V. Philips Long, and Tremper Longman III, *A Biblical History of Israel* (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2003), 266–277.

terize his language."3 Even if some of the particulars of the book may be somewhat vague, its overall clarity offers a lucid picture of the overall message of the prophet. Amos functioned as a covenant prosecutor, representing the Lord. He was God's emissary who brought the message of the King to his subjects, a message consisting primarily of charges against Israel for its violations of the covenant.

<span id="page-305-1"></span><span id="page-305-0"></span>The prophetic techniques employed by Amos set the tone for Israel's severe judgment. The book consists primarily of speeches and oracles of judgment for sin. These speeches are poetic in genre and occur in various formats. In the first two chapters, speeches commence with the expression, "For three transgressions of . . . and for four, I will not revoke the punishment . . ." (1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6). This poetic expression builds a somber and grave atmosphere for the accusations and verdicts that follow. Two oracles are introduced with the troubling cry "Woe" (5:18; 6:1). Some scholars refer to these passages as "oracles of woe," viewed as a distinct category within prophetic literature. These passages convey a tenor of impending doom for the recipients in view of their heinous actions. Other speeches contain the imperative "Hear" (3:1, 13; 4:1; 5:1; 8:4), calling for the recipients not only to *listen* to the prophet's message but also to *respond* appropriately.

<span id="page-305-6"></span><span id="page-305-5"></span><span id="page-305-4"></span><span id="page-305-3"></span><span id="page-305-2"></span>Amos also records four visions illustrating the Lord's condemnation of Israel. These passages provide a visible picture of the dire situation that has come upon the nation. The first two visions consist of a locust plague (7:1–3) and a judgment by fire (7:4–6), and from each of these the Lord relents when the prophet intercedes. Not so with the next two: the third vision is of the Lord holding a plumb line beside a wall (7:7–9), revealing that as God measures Israel, he finds them failing to meet the standard — they are crooked! Therefore, he will not withhold his judgment but will destroy the idolatrous places of Israel and the house of Jeroboam. Amos's final vision from the Lord consists simply of a basket of summer fruit (8:1–3). This image may at first seem harmless, even pleasant, until it is realized that the Hebrew root for "summer fruit" (*qayits*) sounds like the Hebrew root for "end" (*qets*), which is exactly the point of the vision: the end has come for Israel (8:2). The devastation will be great, with dead bodies strewn far and wide (8:3).

<span id="page-305-11"></span><span id="page-305-10"></span><span id="page-305-9"></span><span id="page-305-7"></span>The book also contains a brief autobiographical narrative of Amaziah's confrontation with Amos (7:10–17). Amaziah, the priest of the idolatrous shrine at Bethel, reports the words of the prophet to King Jeroboam and then tells the "seer" (Amos) to leave Israel, go back to Judah, and never again prophesy at Bethel. Amos responds by stating that he has come by the Lord's calling and that Amaziah's wife will become a prostitute and his household and possessions will be lost. The priest himself will also die, and the nation will go into exile (7:17). While this narrative section is relatively brief, it (along with the rest of the book) portrays the prophet as a bold messenger of God who has come not on his own initiative but by divine commission.

## *Theology of Amos; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ* THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD

<span id="page-306-9"></span><span id="page-306-8"></span><span id="page-306-7"></span>Amos joins the other writing prophets in declaring the sovereignty of God over everything in creation. He rules over the affairs of the nations and of Israel, including judging them for their sin. Amos emphasizes that God will bring about the coming destruction: "He who made the Pleiades and Orion" (5:8) will "pass through [their] midst" (5:17) and bring "darkness, and not light" (5:18). The coming judgment is an act of God against the wickedness of his people, and while the instrument of wrath will be foreign nations, it is clear that this will be the "day of the Lord" (5:19, 20). The "day of the Lord" appears frequently within prophetic literature, conveying both the negative sense of judgment and the positive sense of making things right (i.e., restoration; cf. 9:11, 13). In Amos, the former sense is primary. The prophet paints the image of God as a roaring lion (1:2; 3:8) preparing to pounce upon its prey. This lion will wreak immeasurable devastation upon Israel, leaving those who remain fearful to even mention "the name of the Lord" (6:10).

<span id="page-306-12"></span><span id="page-306-11"></span><span id="page-306-10"></span><span id="page-306-4"></span>As God is sovereign in judgment, so he is sovereign in salvation. He will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob (9:8) but will remember his steadfast love toward them. He promises to restore and renew them after this time of chastisement (9:13–15). In this way, Amos reveals that God is sovereignly faithful in keeping his covenant with Israel.

<span id="page-306-17"></span><span id="page-306-16"></span><span id="page-306-13"></span>Ultimately, this promise of restoration and renewal has been fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who will bring about the final restoration of all things (i.e., the new heavens and new earth; Revelation 21–22). Having accomplished his work, Christ has been made Lord over all (Phil. 2:9–11). He is building his kingdom, and nothing stands against him (Matt. 16:18). All things are under his kingly rule, and he will be the great Judge on the final day (Acts 17:30–31).

#### <span id="page-306-15"></span><span id="page-306-14"></span>THE COVENANT

<span id="page-306-0"></span>The covenant instituted at Sinai provided the framework for the relationship between the Lord and his people (Exodus 19–24; the book of Deuteronomy). God chose Israel to be his special people, and they were called to serve him by loving him and obeying his commands. The nation willingly entered into this relationship, accepting the stipulations of the covenant (Ex. 19:7–8). Israel's obedience to the covenant would lead to blessing (Deut. 28:1–14), but disobedience (i.e., breaking the covenant) would lead to cursing (Deut. 27:15–26; 28:15–68).

<span id="page-306-6"></span><span id="page-306-5"></span><span id="page-306-3"></span><span id="page-306-2"></span><span id="page-306-1"></span>The covenant provides the backdrop for Amos's message to Israel, as God brings the people to account for their unfaithfulness to him. For instance, Amos 3:2 states, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." Addressing Judah, Amos states that they will be punished "because they have rejected the law of the Lord, and have not kept his statutes, but their lies have led them astray, those after which their fathers walked" (2:4). The Lord brought Israel up out of Egypt (2:10; 3:1) and drove out the inhabitants

<span id="page-307-4"></span>of the land for them (2:9) so that they might live for the Lord and his ways. Since the people failed to do this, they would face the consequences for their infidelity.

<span id="page-307-13"></span><span id="page-307-12"></span><span id="page-307-9"></span><span id="page-307-8"></span><span id="page-307-3"></span>The NT makes it clear that Jesus Christ is the head of the new covenant (Heb. 8:1–13; 10:1–18). He fulfilled the requirements of God by completely obeying God's law (Rom. 5:19; Gal. 3:10–15; Heb. 4:15). Then, in his death and resurrection, both the curses and the blessings of the covenant are displayed. He received the judgment for sin (i.e., the curse of death) at Calvary (Isa. 53:4–6; Rom. 3:25; 1 John 2:2) and, having been raised from the dead, provides salvation (i.e., the blessing of life) to all who believe in him (Rom. 10:9). In short, Jesus accomplished the faithfulness his people lacked, received the consequences they could not bear, and became the ultimate source of blessing from God. As the apostle Paul said, "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor. 5:21).

#### <span id="page-307-11"></span>IDOLATRY AND SOCIAL INJUSTICE

<span id="page-307-5"></span>The book of Amos highlights the covenant unfaithfulness of Israel in two main areas. First, Israel was guilty of idolatry. They turned away from the only true God to worship the false gods of the surrounding pagan society. This is prominently seen in Amos's frequent mention of Bethel (3:14; 4:4; 5:5, 6; 7:10, 13). When Israel broke away from Judah after Solomon's reign, Jeroboam the son of Nebat4 set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan for worship in the northern kingdom (1 Kings 12:25–33). Israel was thus cut off from the worship of God at the temple in Jerusalem, the worship God had commanded. This allowed for syncretism and idolatry to increase throughout the centuries, leading to a society basically indistinguishable from the pagan nations.

<span id="page-307-1"></span>Since idolatry was at the heart of the nation's unfaithfulness, it is not surprising that their turning from God led them away from his moral standards (i.e., his law) of righteousness, goodness, and equity. Since they failed to love God, they inevitably failed to love their fellow man. Thus social injustice is another major issue addressed in the book. The rich were oppressing the poor, corruption was pervasive, self-aggrandizement was the norm, and remarkable indifference to the plight of others and the immoral state of society was common. Amos emphasizes that the injustice occurring in the land revealed the nation's rejection of Yahweh, and the people would be severely judged for it. In this way, Amos reveals the intimate connection between love for God and love for man. When God's people love him, they will love their fellow human beings by treating them according to his word.

<span id="page-307-6"></span>The NT further draws out the connection between true worship and obedience. Jesus says that the law depends upon the two great commandments regarding love for God and love for neighbor (Matt. 22:37–40). He says that if we love him, we will love our neighbor (Luke 10:25–37) and one another (John 15:12–17). Paul says that love is the fulfillment of the law (Rom. 13:10), and James reveals that

<span id="page-307-10"></span><span id="page-307-7"></span><span id="page-307-2"></span><span id="page-307-0"></span><sup>4</sup> This was Jeroboam I, from the tenth century BC (1 Kings 11:26–39), not Jeroboam II, from the eighth century (2 Kings 14:23–29; cf. Amos 1:1).

<span id="page-308-0"></span>true worship of God leads to caring for the poor and the less fortunate of society (James 1:27–2:13), not social injustice (James 5:1–4). In this way, true worship of God in Jesus Christ leads to loving concern for others.

## *Preaching from Amos*

The book of Amos is well suited for exposing congregations to prophetic literature (especially the Minor Prophets) and lends itself well to preaching. It is concise enough (nine chapters) for the preacher to work through it in a consecutive manner without committing to a significantly extensive period of time. Some may even be able to preach on an entire chapter in each sermon. However, it may be best to divide some of the chapters into smaller units in order to draw out some of the distinct themes and issues of a given passage. Alternatively, a preacher may choose to preach on a selection of passages from the book in order to highlight its central points. The overall message of the book is easy to grasp, so an expositor can get at the heart of Amos's message if thoughtful care is used in selecting passages. Single texts may also be chosen for specific messages, especially to address matters of idolatry, social injustice, God's sovereignty, and God's mercy/faithfulness.

However, caution should be taken and careful discernment employed when preaching a series on Amos. It would be easy to fatigue a congregation with the book's heavy and pervasive message of judgment. There remains a great need for the church today to hear the prophet's message in a plain and direct manner. However, the goal of preaching is to let God's word convict of sin so that the good news of Christ will transform those who hear. Without a steady reminder of what God has done through the death and resurrection of Christ for repentant sinners, a tender heart may become distressed, with little sense of hope. Judgment of sin is a serious matter, and it is essential for it to be clearly proclaimed, to which Amos lends itself. Thus care must be given to remind our hearers that God is gracious and merciful, wonderfully proving himself to be so in his Son.

<span id="page-309-0"></span>1 The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds*<sup>1</sup>* of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years*<sup>2</sup>* before the earthquake.

**<sup>2</sup>**And he said:

"The Lord roars from Zion and utters his voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the top of Carmel withers."

**<sup>3</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment,*<sup>3</sup>* because they have threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron.

**<sup>4</sup>** So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.

**<sup>5</sup>** I will break the gate-bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven,*<sup>4</sup>* and him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden; and the people of Syria shall go into exile to Kir," says the Lord.

**<sup>6</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they carried into exile a whole people to deliver them up to Edom.

- **<sup>7</sup>** So I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour her strongholds.
- **<sup>8</sup>** I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon;
- I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish," says the Lord God.

**<sup>9</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they delivered up a whole people to Edom, and did not remember the covenant of brotherhood. **<sup>10</sup>** So I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre,

and it shall devour her strongholds."

**<sup>11</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because he pursued his brother with the sword and cast off all pity, and his anger tore perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever.

**<sup>12</sup>** So I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the strongholds of Bozrah."

**<sup>13</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.

- **<sup>14</sup>** So I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour her strongholds, with shouting on the day of battle,
- with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
- **<sup>15</sup>** and their king shall go into exile, he and his princes*<sup>5</sup>* together,"

says the Lord.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-311-3"></span>As the book of Amos begins, the Lord is introduced in a dramatic manner as he declares his evaluation both of the nations surrounding Judah and Israel and of the covenant people themselves. The Lord roars his judgment from Zion against the wickedness of the prophet's day. By addressing Gentile nations first (1:3–2:3), Amos reveals that God sovereignly oversees and judges all of humanity. Nothing takes place without his knowing, and the One who sees all overlooks nothing. These introductory passages provide brief statements of condemnation leading to messages against the southern kingdom of Judah (2:4–5) and, especially, the northern kingdom of Israel (2:6–16). The remainder of the book then primarily addresses the northern kingdom and its coming destruction.

<span id="page-311-9"></span><span id="page-311-8"></span><span id="page-311-7"></span><span id="page-311-6"></span><span id="page-311-5"></span><span id="page-311-2"></span><span id="page-311-0"></span>As many have noted, the judgment passages in Amos 1–2 follow a distinct geographical pattern. First is Damascus (1:3–5), located northeast of Canaan, then Gaza (1:6–8), situated to the southwest. Next Amos addresses the northwest by condemning Tyre (1:9–10) and the southeast by speaking to Edom (1:11–12). The central east comes next, with the sons of Ammon (1:13–15) and Moab (2:1–3). Last are Judah (2:4–5) in the south and then Israel (2:6–16) in the north. This pattern provides a crescendo effect as God's judgment encircles the Promised Land before climaxing with the nation of Israel.

Connections between the judgment speeches in the first two chapters are many. Each passage is introduced by the phrase "Thus says the Lord." The repeated statement "For three transgressions . . . and for four, I will not revoke . . ." then follows, establishing a clear formulaic structure for each oracle. Every nation addressed (except Israel) receives the same punishment: God will send "fire" to "devour" the guilty (1:4, 7, 10, 12, 14; 2:2, 5). Some of the passages contain further elaboration after this statement of punishment, but they are all relatively concise, moving the reader quickly to the focus of the book—Israel's coming destruction.

#### *Comment*

1:1 The superscription of the book indicates that what follows comes from the prophet Amos. He is the only writing prophet identified as a "shepherd" (or "sheep breeder"; ESV mg.), and later he describes himself as "a herdsman and a <span id="page-312-13"></span>dresser of sycamore figs," with apparently no formal training in the prophetic ministry (7:14). His hometown (Tekoa) was just south of Jerusalem. (Cf. Introduction: Author.)

<span id="page-312-4"></span>Verse 1 also notes that the book concerns what Amos "saw." This connects to the role of the prophet in Israel as a "seer," i.e., one who receives revelation of events before they occur (cf. Isa. 1:1; Mic. 1:1), often in the form of visions (Amos 7:1–9; 8:1–3). (For a discussion of the book's historical setting, cf. Introduction: Date and Occasion.)

<span id="page-312-12"></span><span id="page-312-6"></span>1:2 This verse begins the message of the book by describing the Lord as a roaring lion. This image is used four times in the OT, each time in a different prophetical book (Jer. 25:30; Hos. 11:10; Joel 3:16; Amos 1:2). In this instance, the Lord roars from his den in "Zion," or "Jerusalem." This was the dwelling place of the Lord among his people, and it was only there that the Israelites were to offer sacrifices to their covenant Lord (Deut. 12:5–7; 1 Kings 9:1–9). The Lord roars because the northern kingdom has been offering worship to false gods (golden calves) at false temples (at Dan and Bethel; cf. 1 Kings 12:25–33). Now God has grown angry at their unfaithfulness and roars his warning of coming ruin.

<span id="page-312-1"></span><span id="page-312-0"></span>It is also fitting that this roaring comes from Jerusalem because Amos was from the southern kingdom of Judah, where Jerusalem was located. In other words, the Lord roared his message from Jerusalem in the south to Israel in the north, and did so by calling Amos to take his message from the southern to the northern kingdom. The mention of the "top of Carmel" is in keeping with the rebuke of the idolatrous northern kingdom, since it was at Carmel in the northern kingdom that Elijah defeated the priests of Baal during the reign of Ahaz (1 Kings 18).

<span id="page-312-2"></span>Carmel "withers" at the sound of God's voice, signifying a judgment of drought. The pastures of the shepherds are said to "mourn," which in context would refer to the sorrow to come because of the drought. This term can also be translated "dry up, wither," which is perhaps more likely here, stating even more clearly that they too will suffer drought.5 In either case, it is clear this will come about because of the Lord's roaring voice. The powerful word of Yahweh thunders through the remainder of this book (Amos 3:1; 4:1; 5:1; 7:16); it will prove to be irresistible, accomplishing the goal for which it is sent.

<span id="page-312-11"></span><span id="page-312-9"></span><span id="page-312-7"></span><span id="page-312-5"></span>1:3–5 "Thus says the Lord . . ." establishes that the message to come originates from Yahweh himself. This is a common phrase in prophetic literature (e.g., Isa. 7:7; Jer. 49:1; Ezek. 23:32; Mic. 3:5) and is repeated throughout the book to reiterate divine sanction of the words that follow (Amos 2:1; 3:11; 5:4, 16).

<span id="page-312-10"></span><span id="page-312-8"></span>The first message from the Lord is a declaration of judgment upon Damascus, the capital of Syria. The passage begins with the formula "For three transgressions . . . and for four" (1:3), a pattern of address emphasizing the wrongdoing and thus elevating the severity of the indictment (cf. Job 5:19; Prov. 6:16–19; 30:15,

<span id="page-312-3"></span><sup>5</sup> See *HALOT*, 1:7; this understanding fits well because it would make the phrase parallel to the "withering" of Carmel.

<span id="page-313-5"></span><span id="page-313-3"></span>18, 21, 29). In this case, the wrong committed is so great that God "will not revoke the punishment" (Amos 1:3) that is coming.6

The nature of the wrong is that the Syrians have "threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron" (v. 3), a vivid agricultural metaphor conveying a heinous attack. Gilead was located in the Transjordanian area bordering southern Syria, and the Syrians apparently attacked that land brutally under the direction of their kings Hazael and Ben-hadad, who ruled from Damascus. The Lord will thus punish the Syrian kings (v. 4) and people (v. 5).

<span id="page-313-1"></span><span id="page-313-0"></span>The Lord states that he will send "fire" to destroy "the house of Hazael" and "devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad" (v. 4). Ben-hadad7 was likely a throne-name for the king of Damascus, since more than one Ben-hadad is mentioned in the OT (1 Kings 15:18, 20; 20:1–43; 2 Kings 6:24; 8:7; 13:3). The only Hazael of Damascus in the OT, mentioned in 2 Kings 8:7–15, assassinated the previous Ben-hadad. Notably, he then named his own son "Ben-hadad" (2 Kings 13:3). The image of fire devouring the house and stronghold of these kings signifies the Lord's destructive judgment against them. (Amos will repeat this image in many of the oracles to come; Amos 1:4, 7, 10, 12, 14; 2:2, 5.)

<span id="page-313-7"></span><span id="page-313-6"></span><span id="page-313-2"></span>Moreover, the Lord states in 1:5 that he "will break the gate-bar of Damascus," referring to the bar used to lock the gates of a city under siege. In other words, Yahweh will undo their defenses, and the battle will overtake the city. This destruction will continue as the inhabitants of "the Valley of Aven [or Iniquity]" are cut off. The location of this valley is uncertain. "Beth-eden" probably refers to Bit-adini, located on the Euphrates River and likely under the control of the Syrians. Both the king of Syria and his people will be exiled to Kir, a city with historical significance for Syria. Douglas Stuart explains: "Kir was Aram's country of origin (Amos 9:7) in eastern Mesopotamia just as Egypt was for Israel."8 ("Aram" was another name for Syria.) Thus their exile to Kir will be a return to insignificance. In short, the judgment proclaimed by God in these verses will extend not just to the city of Damascus but to the entire nation of Syria.

<span id="page-313-12"></span><span id="page-313-11"></span><span id="page-313-10"></span>1:6–8 The next Gentile city condemned is Gaza, a Philistine stronghold on the coast of the Mediterranean. Gaza represents the whole of the Philistine territory, as becomes clear in verse 8, which includes three other Philistine cities: Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron. These are four of the principal Philistine cities, standing here for the whole nation. (A fifth principal city was Gath, which is perhaps missing here and in other lists because it had lessened in importance by this time; cf. Jer. 25:20; Zeph. 2:4; Zech. 9:5–7.)

<span id="page-313-8"></span><span id="page-313-4"></span>God reprimands the Philistines for exiling a whole people and delivering them to Edom (Amos 1:6). The actual historical event being referred to remains uncertain. However, the text reveals that the Philistines captured a group of people and apparently handed them over to be enslaved by the Edomites. Therefore, fire

<span id="page-313-9"></span><sup>6</sup> The same phrase is found in 1:6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6.

<sup>7</sup> Ben-hadad literally means "son of Hadad." Hadad was the god of Damascus.

<sup>8</sup> Douglas K. Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, WBC (Waco, TX: Word, 1987), 311.

<span id="page-314-7"></span><span id="page-314-6"></span>will be sent, and "it shall devour [the] strongholds" (v. 7). The punishment against them will be so severe that none of the Philistines will be left (v. 8). The irony is obvious: The Philistines delivered up a whole people, and therefore the Lord will wholly destroy them.

<span id="page-314-8"></span><span id="page-314-5"></span>1:9–10 These two verses address God's judgment against Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city northwest of Israel on the Mediterranean coast. The judgment follows the same formula as the previous two ("for three transgressions . . . and for four"). Verse 9 charges Tyre with the same crime as that of Gaza (v. 6), adding that it did not remember "the covenant of brotherhood" (v. 9). This covenant was perhaps a treaty with a related people (hence "brotherhood"). Or it may refer to a parity treaty between two parties in which the relationship was likened to a "brotherhood" (1 Kings 5:12; 9:12–13). In either case, Tyre broke this covenant in order to benefit its own political and/or financial position. They handed this group of people over to Edom, and God will now repay them for their treachery against those who were (or were like) family.

<span id="page-314-10"></span><span id="page-314-3"></span>1:11–12 Having been mentioned in the previous two passages, Edom now receives focus. Teman and Bozrah were its major southern and northern cities (or regions); thus this judgment comes on the land from one end to the other.

<span id="page-314-9"></span>Edom is judged because "he pursued his brother with the sword." The ferocity of the Edomites in this endeavor is highlighted by their lack of compassion, their perpetual anger, and their abiding wrath (v. 11). In short, the bloodthirsty demeanor of Edom toward his brother was fueled by utter hatred.

<span id="page-314-1"></span>While Amos does not name the nation on the receiving end of this persecution, it is certain that the Israelites were the object of Edom's fury. Israel and Edom are called "brother" elsewhere (Gen. 25:24–26), and the historical animosity between the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and the descendants of Esau (Edom) is well attested (Gen. 25:19–34; Num. 20:14–21; Ps. 137:7; the book of Obadiah). As in previous oracles, the consequence of Edom's aggression will be God's sending fire to devour them (Amos 1:12).

<span id="page-314-14"></span><span id="page-314-13"></span><span id="page-314-12"></span><span id="page-314-11"></span><span id="page-314-4"></span><span id="page-314-2"></span><span id="page-314-0"></span>1:13–15 Ammonite territory lay to the east of the Jordan River, with Gilead to the north. The detestable act of tearing open pregnant women (v. 13) insinuates the genocidal intent of the Ammonites to conquer and obtain foreign territory (i.e., to "enlarge their border"). This pursuit of self-aggrandizement was not uncommon in the ancient Near East (cf. 2 Kings 8:12; 15:16), and the destruction of helpless mothers and unborn children highlights the vicious nature by which it was sometimes carried out. There is no indication of when the specific incident mentioned here took place, but Ammon had a history of attacking Gilead and capturing its territory (Judg. 10:7–11:33; 1 Sam. 11:1–11). Whatever the incident, the Lord is aware of it, and Rabbah (the capital of Ammon) will experience the "fire" that God will "kindle," and its strongholds will be devoured (Amos 1:14). The Ammonites' devouring of a people will lead ultimately to their own devouring. Their judgment will come in battle marked by war cries ("shouting") as their enemies come upon them on that day (v. 14).

The description of this judgment as arriving with a "tempest in the day of the whirlwind" points to its catastrophic nature: it will be an unstoppable storm that will usher the Ammonite king and his princes into "exile," or captivity (v. 15). The images of tempest and whirlwind appear to allude to the presence of God in this judgment, as these elements are often found in reference to the Lord elsewhere in the OT (Job 38:1; 40:6; Isa. 29:6; 66:15; Jer. 4:13; Nah. 1:3). If this is the case here, then the picture of God's executing this retribution further underscores his function as the Judge of all the earth (Gen. 18:25).

### <span id="page-315-2"></span><span id="page-315-0"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-315-1"></span>The sinful nature of mankind is a universal problem, and these first two chapters of Amos reveal that no nation or person is without sin. God's condemnation of sin is also universal, and the world will be held accountable to him. As a just God, the Lord will by no means allow the guilty to go unpunished (Ex. 34:7). While most people today may not be guilty of the crimes of the nations in this chapter (although some undoubtedly are), everyone has sinned and falls short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). The theme of Amos 1–2 is judgment for sin *against all nations*, which speaks loudly to the contemporary world. God will one day bring mankind to account for its rebellion against him and the evil it has done to one another.

<span id="page-315-5"></span><span id="page-315-4"></span>God has chosen to judge the world through a man, Jesus Christ, and has proved this to all mankind by raising him from the dead (Acts 17:31). The King of kings and Lord of lords will bring justice to bear with equity and accuracy, leaving none to escape. Thankfully, this Judge is full of mercy! The very One who judges the earth bled and died in the place of the guilty. His substitution has secured the acquittal of his people and procured their deliverance from the wrath to come. Because Christ has received their punishment, eternal life has been granted to all who repent and believe. Therefore, the Judge of humanity is also its Savior!

<span id="page-315-6"></span><span id="page-315-3"></span>Since we have been given such a great salvation, we should walk in a manner worthy of Christ and love our neighbors as ourselves. In view of the forgiveness of sin, we are able to forgive others and not repay evil with evil (Rom. 12:17). We know firsthand what our sins deserve, but because of God's great mercy to us in Jesus, we receive grace instead of punishment. The theme of judgment in the book of Amos should increase our gratitude to God, for he does not deal with us according to what our sins deserve (Ps. 103:10).

## AMOS 2:1–16

# <span id="page-316-0"></span>2 Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment,*<sup>1</sup>* because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom.

- **<sup>2</sup>** So I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the strongholds of Kerioth, and Moab shall die amid uproar, amid shouting and the sound of the trumpet;
- **<sup>3</sup>** I will cut off the ruler from its midst, and will kill all its princes*<sup>2</sup>* with him,"

says the Lord.

**<sup>4</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have rejected the law of the Lord, and have not kept his statutes, but their lies have led them astray,

those after which their fathers walked.

- **<sup>5</sup>** So I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem."
- **<sup>6</sup>**Thus says the Lord:

"For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals—

- **<sup>7</sup>** those who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth and turn aside the way of the afflicted; a man and his father go in to the same girl, so that my holy name is profaned;
- **<sup>8</sup>** they lay themselves down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge, and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.
- **<sup>9</sup>** "Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars and who was as strong as the oaks;

 I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath.

- **<sup>10</sup>** Also it was I who brought you up out of the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
- **<sup>11</sup>** And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?" declares the Lord.
- **<sup>12</sup>** "But you made the Nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets, saying, 'You shall not prophesy.'
- **<sup>13</sup>** "Behold, I will press you down in your place, as a cart full of sheaves presses down.

- **<sup>16</sup>** and he who is stout of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day,"

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-317-3"></span><span id="page-317-2"></span>The Lord's roar continues into chapter 2 along lines similar to the previous passages. The nations are addressed once more (Moab; 2:1–3), but the focus soon turns toward the chosen people of God (vv. 4–5, 6–16). To this point, the indictments have been encircling the land of Canaan, strategically condemning the surrounding nations, but now the prophet zeroes in on the people of the Promised Land. He has them in his sights, and with precision he unleashes a volley of Yahweh's judgments against them. Judah receives a brief condemnation in verses 4–5 (similar to the nations), but the primary concern of the prophet is the northern kingdom of Israel (vv. 6–16). This chapter begins the barrage of judgments against Israel that continues to the final chapter of the book. God's great concern is the rejection of his word that is manifested in the immoral and idolatrous activity of the northern kingdom, and he will by no means let the guilty go unpunished (Ex. 34:7).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-318-6"></span><span id="page-318-5"></span>2:1–3 God's judgment against Moab follows the same pattern as the passages addressing previous nations. Their transgression, however, pertains to actions taken against Edom: burning to lime the bones of its king (v. 1). This was an act of desecration against their neighbors to the south. It likely points to the utter destruction of this king, although the exact way in which it was accomplished remains unclear. Billy Smith suggests several possibilities: "Either Edom's king was burned to death, or his corpse was burned, or his skeletal remains were exhumed and burned to lime. The last suggestion best fits the wording, since the specific reference is to 'the bones of Edom's king.'"9

<span id="page-318-1"></span>In response to this act of desecration, the Lord will send fire to devour Moab and the "strongholds of Kerioth" (v. 2), an important Moabite city (Jer. 48:24, 41). Kerioth is mentioned in the inscription on the famous Moabite stele—known as the Mesha stele after King Mesha, who set it up—as the site of the sanctuary of the Moabite god Chemosh. For their crime, the people of Moab will perish among war cries and trumpet blasts: their violent destruction will take place in battle (Amos 2:2). Their ruler will be cut off and their princes killed by God himself (v. 3). The language here once again emphasizes Yahweh's sovereignty, as he will personally dispense this punishment.

<span id="page-318-9"></span><span id="page-318-8"></span><span id="page-318-7"></span>2:4–5 The covenant people come into view in these verses as Amos accuses the southern kingdom of Judah of rejecting the Lord's "law" (*torah*; v. 4). The next line parallels this indictment by furthering the charge: they have not kept God's "statutes" (*khoq*). This judgment emphasizes the covenant unfaithfulness of the people. They have not kept God's covenant, and their actions, which are contrary to God's word, yields the evidence of this. A holistic failure to uphold the covenant stipulations is clearly implied by this indictment. The word translated "their lies" perhaps refers specifically to false teaching.10 These "lies" have led them away from God, and the remainder of verse 4 indicates that the present nation has followed in the footsteps of the previous generations ("their fathers") in doing so. This is a continuous and ongoing transgression by God's people.

<span id="page-318-4"></span><span id="page-318-3"></span>It is important to note that the punishment of Judah is the same as that of the nations: God will send "fire" to "devour the strongholds of Jerusalem" (1:4, 7, 10, 12, 14; 2:2). The capital city will be destroyed; the entire nation will fall. This eventually took place at the fall of Jerusalem in 587/586 BC and in the subsequent Babylonian captivity (cf. Jer. 52:13).

<span id="page-318-10"></span><span id="page-318-2"></span>Interestingly, this is the only time Judah is condemned in the book of Amos. The southern kingdom is not mentioned again except when Amaziah the priest tells Amos to go back to Judah (Amos 7:12). While Judah was guilty of the same sins as Israel, the book of Amos pertains predominately to the judgment of the northern kingdom.

<span id="page-318-0"></span><sup>9</sup> Billy K. Smith and Frank S. Page, *Amos, Obadiah, Jonah*, NAC (Nashville: Broadman & Holman, 1995), 57. 10 Francis I. Andersen and David Noel Freedman, *Amos*, AB (New York: Doubleday, 1989), 301–305. They suggest the teaching came from false prophets in particular; cf. Jeremiah 23:30–32.

<span id="page-319-8"></span><span id="page-319-7"></span><span id="page-319-5"></span>2:6–11 Amos 2:6–16 is the first of many sections in the book condemning the nation of Israel for its sins. This passage begins with the same formula present in the previous passages ("For three transgressions . . . and for four . . ."; v. 6) but lacks the mention of God's sending fire to devour its strongholds. However, there is fuller elaboration on the reason for this judgment (vv. 6–8) and also a reminder of God's goodness to the nation in the past (vv. 9–11).

<span id="page-319-11"></span><span id="page-319-9"></span><span id="page-319-6"></span><span id="page-319-2"></span><span id="page-319-1"></span>The first several indictments pertain to social injustices. Selling "the righteous for silver" and "the needy for a pair of sandals" (v. 6) may refer to selling people into slavery (cf. Lev. 25:39–42) and/or receiving bribes from the wealthy in exchange for partiality (Ex. 23:6; Jer. 5:28). This implies corruption in the legal and business dealings of the society, as those who are rich take advantage of the innocent and the poor. The abuse of the lower classes of society is also noted in Amos 2:7, which indicts "those who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth," highlighting the oppression of the needy for self-aggrandizement. Further, the accusation that they were turning "aside the way of the afflicted" reveals intentional opposition to the needy. Amos presents this injustice, along with the people's indifference to it, as a prominent sin in Israel. God challenges the hearers with these indictments, making it clear that they have failed to love their neighbor or protect the less fortunate of society.

<span id="page-319-10"></span><span id="page-319-0"></span>The second half of verse 7 notes the presence of sexual immorality, and verse 8 shows that the immorality may be connected to wrongful forms of worship. A man and his father have sexual relations with the same girl, who may be a cultic prostitute or simply an adulteress. The guilty bed down "beside every altar on garments taken in pledge" (v. 8). The mention of multiple altars reveals unorthodox worship in Israel; furthermore, the Israelites were forbidden by Mosaic law to keep overnight the garments of another as a pledge (Ex. 22:26–27). The worship context continues with the mention of drinking "in the house of their God . . . the wine of those who have been fined." "Wine" refers to goods unjustly acquired, connecting the social crimes with heterodox or syncretistic worship, which further profanes God's "holy name" (Amos 2:7). By their lives and actions, the people have made a mockery of worship and have broken God's covenant. No matter how much worship they offer, it is an offense to God because it violates his word and is full of wickedness.

<span id="page-319-12"></span><span id="page-319-4"></span><span id="page-319-3"></span>In verses 9–11, God recalls his deliverance of Israel out of Egypt and his bringing them into the Promised Land. He highlights the grace and kindness he has shown them, in contrast to their unfaithfulness and iniquity. The Amorites dwelled in Canaan at the time of the conquest, and Yahweh "destroyed" them even though they were great in stature (v. 9). The description of the Amorites in verse 9 recalls the account given by the spies of the exodus generation (Num. 13:27–33). The Lord defeated this formidable foe after forty years of wandering in the wilderness (Amos 2:10; cf. the book of Joshua). Not only did God bless them by making them a new nation and giving them the land of Canaan; he also gave them special gifts to benefit the people. He raised up "prophets" from among them to proclaim God's word so that the people would hear from their God. He also made some to be Nazirites (Num. 6:1–21), who were especially dedicated to God for service

<span id="page-320-1"></span>(e.g., Samson; Judg. 13:7). They served as a reminder of the privileged position that Israel held as God's chosen people.

All of these blessings and gifts came to Israel by the sheer grace of God, which only highlights by way of contrast the wickedness of the nation. The people have spurned God's goodness and trampled underfoot his grace, despite knowing full well how good and gracious he has been to them. The Lord even questions the people regarding the history of his love toward them: "Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?" (Amos 2:11).

<span id="page-320-7"></span><span id="page-320-6"></span><span id="page-320-5"></span><span id="page-320-0"></span>2:12–16 Amos notes the wicked response of Israel to God's gifts (v. 12). The people force the Nazirites to break their vows (abstaining from wine was part of the Nazirite vow; Num. 6:2–3), and they forbid the prophets to preach, which is in essence a rejection of God and his word. They do not desire to hear from Yahweh; they desire instead to walk according to their own designs. This repudiation of God's covenant has incurred his wrath, and the following description reveals that no one will escape the coming judgment.

<span id="page-320-9"></span><span id="page-320-8"></span>Amos 2:13 begins with the interjection "Behold," capturing the hearer's attention for the ensuing punishment. God will "press down" the people like a cart presses down under the weight of sheaves (v. 13). This agricultural picture presents the crushing nature of God's judgment. Next the prophet provides a sevenfold description of the pervasive nature of the coming destruction (as seven represents fullness/completion): (1) The "swift" will not be able to find escape (or "refuge," another possible translation of the Hb. for "flight"; v. 14). (2) The strong will be made weak. (3) The mighty will not deliver his life. (4) The bowman will not stand (meaning he will fall in battle). (5) The "swift of foot" will not escape, another ironic reversal (v. 15). (6) The rider on the horse—far faster than someone on foot—will not be able to deliver his life. (7) Even the bravest among the mighty (i.e., "the stout of heart") will flee away with nothing ("naked") at the time of judgment (v. 16), meaning he will be stripped naked or, more likely, stripped of his armor.11 The scene described in these verses is one of utter pandemonium and chaos as the Lord "presses" down the nation in judgment. No one will escape the coming wrath, which is due to the covenant unfaithfulness of the people.

<span id="page-320-11"></span><span id="page-320-10"></span><span id="page-320-2"></span>In chapters 1–2, the Lion (1:2) has roared his judgments against the nations and his own people, but his indictments against Israel have only begun. The judgments and pictures of the coming destruction only intensify as the book progresses, as the severity of the people's sins becomes visible in the severity of the punishments Amos declares. The Lord's patience with Israel has run out, and the warning cry has begun. The judgment is coming.

## *Response*

<span id="page-320-4"></span><span id="page-320-3"></span>While God judges all nations (1:3–2:3), those who have received his word are held to higher account for their responses to him (2:4–5; 2:6–16). The Lord makes clear

that all the earth has sinned in his sight, but the wickedness of those who have rebelled against the light of his special revelation is even more heinous. Israel's chosen and privileged position as God's people makes their rejection of him and his covenant particularly egregious, especially in light of the exodus and conquest of Canaan (2:9–10).

<span id="page-321-0"></span>The same is true in NT times. The author of Hebrews writes concerning this issue of sinning against the gospel that has been received:

If we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay." And again, "The Lord will judge his people." It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. (Heb. 10:26–31)

<span id="page-321-5"></span><span id="page-321-3"></span>This is a sobering warning to the visible church regarding our response to the message of "Jesus Christ and him crucified" (1 Cor. 2:2). If we do not respond in true faith, which leads to obedience, the Lord will uncover the true conditions of our hearts. Jesus himself said,

Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?" And then will I declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness." (Matt. 7:21–23)

<span id="page-321-6"></span><span id="page-321-1"></span>As the apostle Peter makes clear, judgment begins with the household of God (1 Pet. 4:17), and this judgment will be more severe than what we see in the book of Amos (Rev. 16:1–21; 19:17–21; 20:7–15).

<span id="page-321-7"></span><span id="page-321-4"></span><span id="page-321-2"></span>This truth is not meant to make God's people live in terror, but it does serve to exhort us to live in a manner worthy of the light of the gospel. Christ has saved us and given us great grace; as a result, we are to live in grateful adoration of, and obedience to, the Savior who has bought us with his own precious blood. Therefore, let us not bring shame upon Christ, nor let ungodliness even be named among us, "as is proper among saints" (Eph. 5:3). We have such a great Savior! Let us worship and obey him because we love him (John 14:15).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-323-3"></span><span id="page-323-1"></span><span id="page-323-0"></span>Having addressed the Gentile nations and then turning his attention to the northern kingdom in chapters 1–2, Amos furthers the indictment against Israel in chapters 3–6. The repeated imperative "Hear" occurs in 3:1, 13; 4:1; and 5:1, linking together the message of these chapters. Continuing the exodus theme introduced in 2:9–11, Amos 3 begins by reminding Israel of the special nature of their election (3:1) before announcing their certain demise (vv. 2–15). In light of their covenantal relationship with Yahweh, Israel's crimes seem all the more outrageous (v. 2). Their glaring guilt has induced an inescapable judgment. The Lord continues to roar.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-323-4"></span>3:1–6 This chapter begins with a call for the Israelites to "hear" the word of God against them, a call that will be repeated three more times in the book (3:13; 4:1; 5:1), suggesting an important message is coming.

The Lord describes the Israelites as the people he "brought up out of the land of Egypt." Reference to the exodus recalls the covenantal relationship between God and the people, reiterating the saving acts of God's grace toward them in the past (cf. 2:9–11). The previous chapter noted the egregiousness of the Israelites' sins in light of this grace (2:12), and the present chapter continues this theme.

<span id="page-323-5"></span><span id="page-323-2"></span>God again highlights his special election of Israel: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth" (3:2). The contrast between the "whole family [of Israel]" <span id="page-324-1"></span>(v. 1) and "all the families of the earth" (v. 2) highlights God's special choice of Jacob's descendants. They have a unique relationship with him and a privileged position, which entails greater responsibilities for faithfulness and severer consequences for disobedience. For this reason ("therefore"), the repercussion of Israel's iniquities is punishment (v. 2). The emphasis on the special grace of God toward Israel makes clear that their infidelity is especially reprehensible.

<span id="page-324-5"></span><span id="page-324-4"></span><span id="page-324-2"></span>Verses 3–5 pose a series of rhetorical questions leading the reader to see the inevitability of the coming judgment. Each of these questions highlights two things that go hand in hand—certain outcomes of basic cause and effect. Two companions walk together *because* they have agreed to meet (v. 3). The lion and the young lion roar *because* they have seized their prey (v. 4). Birds are captured *because* snares have been set (v. 5). These illustrations display the certainty of the coming punishment, as the truthfulness of these interrogative statements (i.e., that one thing leads to the other) reveals to the audience that everything the prophet declares is true and will take place.

<span id="page-324-7"></span><span id="page-324-6"></span>The final two questions in verse 6 build upon the previous rhetorical questions, highlighting the certainty of the coming calamity. The trumpet announces the arrival of enemy forces and strikes fear in the people, as the city knows the adversary has come to conquer and overthrow its inhabitants. However, it is not merely the foreign opposition that brings about this destruction; the sovereign Lord determines the outcome of the battle. The disaster that comes upon a city is always from the hand of God, and so the coming catastrophe against Israel is the inevitable result of his covenant arrangement with them—it is the curse for infidelity.

<span id="page-324-8"></span><span id="page-324-3"></span>3:7 This verse breaks the string of questions from verses 3–6 and makes a clear statement of God's way of dealing with mankind. Before the Lord acts, he makes known his "secret" to his prophets, who then declare it to the people. This underscores the prophet's role as the representative of the Lord, the very mouthpiece of God in the world. The authority of the prophet is thereby established as he makes known what has been hidden from others. In this way, God calls the audience to listen to Amos and warns them that his words are true, continuing from verses 3–6 the focus on the truthfulness of the message.

<span id="page-324-9"></span>3:8 Amos returns to his inquiry with two statements, each followed by rhetorical questions. Following the previous verse regarding God's making known his secret counsel to his prophets (v. 7), Amos clearly states, "The lion has roared. . . . The Lord God has spoken." The parallel nature of "lion" and "the Lord God" is clear, connecting with the imagery of God as a roaring lion at the beginning of the book (1:2). Who will not fear, since this "lion" has roared? And who can but prophesy, since this God has spoken? The very voice of God evokes a response of terror and drives his servants to declare his word.

<span id="page-324-10"></span><span id="page-324-0"></span>3:9–10 The call to make this message heard to the "strongholds" of Ashdod (a Philistine city) and of Egypt pictures these foreign nations as an audience bearing witness to the judgment of Samaria (the capital city of Israel's northern kingdom). Those at ease in their citadels in Ashdod and Egypt are summoned to the mountains of Samaria as if they were spectators of the events at hand. In particular, the Philistines and Egyptians are called to "see the great tumults" in the capital city, referring to the chaotic upheaval, and to see "the oppressed" within her, referring to the injustice within Israelite society.

The address to Ashdod and Egypt may be akin to calling witnesses against the accused in a legal setting. Ashdod and Egypt are foreign nations guilty of the same type of wickedness as is Israel (oppression, social injustice, inequity, immorality, idolatry, etc.), but in this case they are called to testify to *the evil of God's covenant people*. The idea of wicked, Gentile nations as observers of the fate of Israel would have been disturbing and detestable, to say the least.

<span id="page-325-1"></span>What these nations will see is that the people of Israel "do not know how to do right" (v. 10). "Right" can also mean "straight," implying a nation that is crooked and does not act correctly. Ironically, Israel was given the law in order to live in a distinctly righteous manner as a beacon of "right" lifestyle in a world surrounded by crooked nations. Now they are no different from the neighboring Gentiles, and perhaps even worse! What follows is a punishment that fits the crime: because they "store up violence and robbery in their strongholds," these strongholds will not protect them from the consequences of their deeds; instead, they will be plundered (v. 11).

<span id="page-325-2"></span>3:11 The covenant Lord reveals the repercussions ("therefore") of the people's "violence and robbery" (v. 10): an "adversary" is coming to lay siege to Samaria and surround Israel. There is no indication in the text regarding the identity of this opposing force, but it is undoubtedly Assyria, the most powerful nation on the earth at that time. The fall of Samaria to Assyria in 722 BC confirms this interpretation.

Even though the people of Israel feel safe in their fortified cities and are complacent with the status quo, this opponent will tear down their defenses and plunder their strongholds. "Strongholds" occurs twelve times in the book of Amos,12 referring to the luxurious fortifications that were places of refuge, comfort, safety, and indulgence, especially for the royal/ruling class of society. However, the violence and robbery Samaria has stored up will now come upon them. As Israel has plundered their own countrymen, so a foreign adversary will now plunder them, and their "strongholds" will no longer offer protection.

<span id="page-325-4"></span><span id="page-325-3"></span><span id="page-325-0"></span>3:12 The illustration in verse 12a refers to an animal that has been torn by a lion. Its shepherd is unable to save the sheep (or some other livestock) but recovers parts of the mangled body. The remnant of the animal is then taken to the owner as proof that the shepherd did not steal or sell the sheep. This custom was common in the ancient Near East and is even recorded in the law of Moses: "If [the animal]

<span id="page-326-2"></span>is torn by beasts, let him bring it as evidence. He shall not make restitution for what has been torn" (Ex. 22:13).

The prophet then compares the mangled remains of the sheep with the mangled remains of Samaria. Far from expressing deliverance or rescue, this verse describes the tattered remains of the people there. Those who have enjoyed the comforts of life, unjustly obtained, will be mangled in the destruction. A "corner of a couch and part13 of a bed" will be the only remaining evidence of the people who reveled in their unrighteous wealth. This imagery points to the vicious attack of the coming adversary (Amos 3:11) upon the complacent strongholds of Samaria.

<span id="page-326-9"></span><span id="page-326-7"></span><span id="page-326-5"></span><span id="page-326-4"></span><span id="page-326-0"></span>3:13–15 The second occurrence of the command to "Hear" begins verse 13 (cf. 3:1; 4:1; 5:1) and offers a general call to an anonymous audience to "testify" against Israel ("the house of Jacob"). This language portrays Israel as on trial for its crimes. Witnesses are called forward to attest to the unfaithfulness of Israel regarding its relationship to God and his law. Referring to the northern kingdom as the "house of Jacob" evokes the historical relationship of their forefather with Yahweh (Gen. 28:13–17). God's promises to Jacob were the heritage of Israel; the people's unfaithfulness reveals a departure from the faith of their forefathers. Notably in Amos 3:13, the Lord is called "the God of hosts," a title occurring also in Amos 6:14 and 9:5. The word for "hosts" (Hb. *tseba'ot*) can refer to the multitudes of an army (a "host" of soldiers) and alludes to the image of God as Divine Warrior-King, an image common throughout the OT (Exodus 15; Isa. 13:4–16; Habakkuk 3). However, instead of fighting for Israel (as was the case in the past), the Lord will now lead a holy war against them!

<span id="page-326-12"></span><span id="page-326-11"></span><span id="page-326-10"></span><span id="page-326-6"></span><span id="page-326-1"></span>Although the phrase "the day of the Lord" is not used here (cf. Amos 5:18, 20), the theme is clearly in view in 3:14, which mentions the "day" on which the Lord will punish Israel's transgressions. The day of the Lord is a rich theme in the OT, especially among the prophets. On this day God's justice is meted out on an offending nation/people. In some instances, the day of the Lord is depicted as coming upon individual nations in the course of history, such as on Israel (Amos 5:18–20) or Edom (Obad. 10–15). However, there is also a future element of universal judgment to this theme, as seen in Obadiah 15: "The day of the Lord is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head." Significantly, the "mini-days" of the Lord (e.g., the fall of Israel, Judah, Egypt, Edom, and Babylon) point forward to the great and final day of the Lord.

<span id="page-326-15"></span><span id="page-326-14"></span><span id="page-326-13"></span><span id="page-326-8"></span><span id="page-326-3"></span>God will punish the "transgressions" of Israel, namely, the "altars of Bethel" (Amos 3:14). Amos mentions Bethel six times in this book (3:14; 4:4; 5:5, 6; 7:10, 13); the city was one of the sites at which Jeroboam son of Nebat set up golden calves for worship in the northern kingdom (1 Kings 12:25–33). The city thus represents the epicenter of Israel's idolatry over the centuries. The mention of "altars" (not just "an altar") may suggest multiple sites for religious ceremonies:

<sup>13</sup> The Hebrew word for "and part" is obscure. Some render it "Damascus." For further discussion, see Shalom M. Paul, *Amos*, Hermeneia (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1991), 120–122.

the indulgence of the people in idolatrous worship has spread throughout Bethel, and even beyond. But God's forbearance of false worship in the land has come to an end, and the altars will now be destroyed (Amos 3:14).

<span id="page-327-4"></span><span id="page-327-1"></span>Along with the destruction of the altars, verse 14 specifies that "the horns of the altar will be cut off." Gary Smith offers insight into what the removal of the "horns of the altar" symbolizes: "The people will no longer be able to put some of the blood from their sacrifices on the horns of the altar (Lev. 4:7; 16:18), so that the possibility of making atonement for their sins is being removed. Nor will they be able to grasp the horns of the altar to gain protection from punishment (Ex. 21:12–14; 1 Kings 1:50; 2:28)."14 There will be no way for Israel to protect itself from God's wrath on that terrible day.15

<span id="page-327-5"></span><span id="page-327-0"></span>The final verse of the chapter pertains to the privileged sector of Israelite society, as the various houses of the wealthy will be destroyed: winter, summer, ivory, and great (or many) houses (Amos 3:15). The prosperity of the wealthy (at the expense of the poor) is employed in extravagant and indulgent living. These homes were the fruit of unrighteous oppression, and now their destruction symbolizes the end of an inequitable society. Notably, social abuses against the poor in Israel are addressed further in the following passage (4:1–3).

### <span id="page-327-6"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-327-7"></span><span id="page-327-3"></span><span id="page-327-2"></span>The privileged position of Israel through sovereign election is highlighted at the beginning of this chapter (3:1–2). In the Bible, election is based not on the worthiness of the people but on the purpose of God's will (Eph. 1:5). Israel never merited this kindness nor was it entitled to this calling. Deuteronomy 7:6–10 clearly states this truth:

You are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the Lord loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations, and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.

God's grace demands a response, and Israel was called to love God and obey his word. They were called to godly living, but instead their wickedness brought

<sup>14</sup> Gary V. Smith, *Hosea, Amos, Micah*, NIVAC (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2001), 286–287.

<sup>15</sup> Ibid., 287.

judgment upon themselves. They spurned the grace of God and did not love the One who chose them.

<span id="page-328-3"></span>Likewise, the apostle Paul makes it abundantly clear that election undergirds every believer's salvation. In Ephesians 1:3–14, he wonderfully elaborates the mystery of God's grace toward those who believe. Paul underscores the sovereign, unmerited, and unconditional nature of God's election of believers, which is according to God's purpose and not determined by man. In the light of this, how should we, as believers, live?

<span id="page-328-6"></span><span id="page-328-5"></span><span id="page-328-4"></span>Electing grace leads to grateful, loving obedience. Note Paul's reasoning in the book of Ephesians: "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them" (Eph. 2:10). "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called" (4:1). "This I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart" (4:17–18). "Be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (5:1–2). Grace demands, motivates, and urges us to a loving and grateful pursuit of godliness. Ultimately, the goal of God's gracious election is to make us holy: "Those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers" (Rom. 8:29).

<span id="page-328-7"></span><span id="page-328-2"></span><span id="page-328-1"></span><span id="page-328-0"></span>In the book of Amos, ancient Israel provides an example of spurning the grace of God, warning professed Christians against neglecting so great a salvation (Heb. 2:3). May the fruit of God's grace in Jesus Christ be evident in our lives. May we love the Lord and keep his commandments (John 14:15).

## AMOS 4:1–13

4 "Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to your husbands, 'Bring, that we may drink!' **<sup>2</sup>** The Lord God has sworn by his holiness that, behold, the days are coming upon you, when they shall take you away with hooks, even the last of you with fishhooks. **<sup>3</sup>** And you shall go out through the breaches, each one straight ahead; and you shall be cast out into Harmon,"

declares the Lord.

**<sup>4</sup>** "Come to Bethel, and transgress; to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days;

**<sup>5</sup>** offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them; for so you love to do, O people of Israel!"

declares the Lord God.

**<sup>6</sup>** "I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, yet you did not return to me,"

declares the Lord.

**<sup>7</sup>** "I also withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest; I would send rain on one city, and send no rain on another city; one field would have rain,

and the field on which it did not rain would wither;

declares the Lord.

**<sup>9</sup>** "I struck you with blight and mildew; your many gardens and your vineyards, your fig trees and your olive trees the locust devoured; yet you did not return to me,"

declares the Lord.

declares the Lord.

**<sup>11</sup>** "I overthrew some of you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a brand*<sup>2</sup>* plucked out of the burning; yet you did not return to me,"

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-330-5"></span><span id="page-330-4"></span>Chapter 4 begins with the imperative "Hear," which occurs throughout chapters 3–5 to indicate the start of a new section (3:1, 13; 4:1; 5:1) and also to link together the message of these chapters. In this case, the indictment of Israel begun in chapter 3 is continuing.

<span id="page-330-9"></span><span id="page-330-8"></span><span id="page-330-3"></span>Chapter 4 begins by highlighting the injustices of privileged members of society toward the poor (vv. 1–3) before turning to address all Israelites, sarcastically calling them to continue in their hypocritical worship (vv. 4–5). The Lord goes on to note that he has already punished and chastised them for their sin (vv. 6–11), but these acts have had relatively no effect upon them ("yet you did not return to me"). As a result, he will no longer simply roar forth in speech. He is coming to meet them in judgment (vv. 12–13).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-330-7"></span>4:1–3 The imperative "Hear" begins the third oracle in a string of three that began in chapter 3 (vv. 1, 13). These oracles incriminate the people of Israel for their mistreatment of fellow countrymen and their idolatrous practices. The speech that begins in 4:1 carries the indictment further by calling attention to a subset of the nation and their callousness and rebelliousness.

The epithet "cows of Bashan" (v. 1) is most likely a reference to wealthy elite women in the city of Samaria. Some have suggested that the phrase refers to the city leaders, while others note an allusion to the Baal fertility cult. However, most commentators interpret this as a reference to the high society women of the capital. "Cow" in Hebrew is feminine in gender, and the Hebrew participles for "oppress" and "crush" occur in feminine form here as well. Along with mention of these cows' "husbands," the evidence suggests that God is singling out this sector of Israelite society. They are not the only guilty party, but Amos employs them as an example of the ruthless disorder among the nation.

<span id="page-330-6"></span><span id="page-330-2"></span><span id="page-330-1"></span><span id="page-330-0"></span>The phrase "cows of Bashan" is a revealing symbol of the rich women of this time. In the OT, Bashan evokes the idea of agricultural prosperity, as it was known for its opulent pastureland (Jer. 50:19; Mic. 7:14). Livestock from this Transjordanian area were known for their fatness and size (Deut. 32:14; Ps. 22:12; Ezek. 39:18) and provided amply for feasts and sacrifices. Thus these affluent women are being compared to cows that graze constantly on the abundance of the land. The women's lives of indulgence have made them voluminous, slothful, and demanding. They "oppress the poor" and "crush the needy" (Amos 4:1), the same

<span id="page-331-12"></span><span id="page-331-5"></span><span id="page-331-3"></span>Notably, these women are guilty of maltreatment not only of inferiors but also of superiors. They command their husbands (lit., "lords"), "Bring, that we may drink!" (4:1). These women defiantly and selfishly take advantage of others, using them for their own ends. Their concern is not for what is morally right or socially acceptable. Instead, they live unto themselves; their god is their belly (cf. Phil. 3:19). It is worth noting how these affluent and domineering women present a picture of Israel as a whole as guilty of oppressing the poor and needy, and defiant of the authority structure of marriage (women to husbands [lit., "lords"] and Israel to Lord Yahweh; cf. Hosea 1–3).

<span id="page-331-6"></span><span id="page-331-2"></span><span id="page-331-1"></span>In response to their callous behavior, Yahweh makes an oath, swearing by "his holiness" (Amos 4:2). This indicates an especially strong oath. For example, in Psalm 89:35 the Lord swears by his "holiness" *never* to violate his covenant with David. This oath formula in Amos 4 thus accentuates God's relentless commitment to bringing about his judgment.

<span id="page-331-11"></span><span id="page-331-10"></span><span id="page-331-4"></span>The phrase "the days are coming" is an eschatological expression pointing forward to the day of the Lord, when God will come in judgment (Amos 8:11; 9:13). The day of the Lord can refer to imminent temporal judgment or to a future final judgment, or both. In this context, an imminent judgment is clearly in view. The "cows of Bashan" will be taken away with "hooks" and "fishhooks."16 Fishing imagery is employed in ancient Near Eastern reliefs to portray one nation's conquering another and leading their captives away like fish on a string. For instance, an Assyrian relief shows captives led into exile with hooks in their lips or noses, connected to each other by rope.17

<span id="page-331-7"></span>The oppression these ruthless women have shown toward the poor and needy will thus come back upon them in the form of oppression by a foreign power. They will be led out of the city (in which they wallowed in their immorality) through "breaches" made in the walls by the enemy (4:3). There will be so many breaches that it will be as if there were no wall, so that "each one" will simply go out "straight ahead"18 as they depart in exile to Harmon. The term "Harmon" occurs only here in the OT, and its meaning is unknown. Many associate it with Mount Hermon and see it as pointing to the regions "beyond Damascus" (5:27). While its meaning may be uncertain, the point of the entire text is clear: the luxurious self-indulgence of these Samarian women will end in horror as they are dragged to a foreign land.

<span id="page-331-9"></span><span id="page-331-8"></span>4:4–5 The preceding oracle is followed by a sarcastic invitation for the people of Israel to continue in their false worship. God had commanded Israel to worship

<sup>16</sup> There is debate on the translation of these words. Their current forms refer elsewhere to "shields" and "pots," though there are related words built on the same roots that refer to "thorns." "By extension from this meaning, many translators render the terms as hooks for dragging away corpses or to fasten captives together" (Smith and Page, *Amos, Obadiah, Jonah*, 86). Cf. Paul, *Amos*, 130–134, for full discussion.

<span id="page-331-0"></span><sup>18</sup> The Hebrew expression is basically equivalent to Joshua 6:5, 20 ("everyone straight before him") regarding the conquering of Jericho. This may suggest a reversal of the roles of Israel as the ones who will now be conquered.

<span id="page-332-8"></span><span id="page-332-7"></span>him in Jerusalem, but Bethel19 and Gilgal20 had become religious centers in the northern kingdom. Now the Lord calls Israel to come to these places to worship to offer morning sacrifices, tithes, thanksgiving sacrifices, and freewill offerings (vv. 4b–5). But he prefaces this by saying, "Come to Bethel, *and transgress*; to Gilgal, *and multiply transgression*" (v. 4a). In other words, their worship was viewed as sinful rebellion. They loved to practice religion ("for so you love to do") but did not do so according to the Lord's commands, nor did they match their worship with obedience. The sarcasm of the Lord's command makes clear that no matter how much they multiply their worship, God will not accept it, nor will he relent from his coming judgment.

<span id="page-332-13"></span><span id="page-332-11"></span><span id="page-332-3"></span>4:6–11 These six verses contain five short descriptions of various punishments Israel has experienced. The repetition of "I" throughout the passage makes clear that the Lord himself has brought these punishments to bear. He has taken away food (v. 6), rain (vv. 7–8), produce (v. 9), and human and animal life (v. 10), overthrowing21 the people like Sodom and Gomorrah (v. 11). Such discipline should have led his people to repentance (Deut. 30:1–10), but Israel did not listen! The Lord ends each of these five descriptions with the blistering assertion "yet you did not return to me"! This is both a critique and an expression of dismay that Israel has remained unrepentant after the various calamities. One would expect human beings to cry out to God when life turns dire, but instead the people persisted in their rebellion against him.

<span id="page-332-9"></span>A few phrases from these verses may be briefly expounded. "Cleanness of teeth" (Amos 4:6) refers to God's withholding food from the people by way of famine. Unable to chew because of lack of food, their teeth remained clean. The "stench of your camp" (v. 10) implies that death from disease and warfare filled their camp with malodor. Finally, to refer to Israel as a "brand plucked out of the burning" demonstrates that even amid punishment, God graciously saved some from certain destruction (cf. Zech. 3:2; Jude 23). In wrath, God continued to remember mercy (Hab. 3:2), but the people still did not return to him.

<span id="page-332-16"></span><span id="page-332-15"></span><span id="page-332-10"></span><span id="page-332-5"></span><span id="page-332-0"></span>Taken together, the punishments of Amos 4:6–11 reflect the curses of the Mosaic covenant (Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 27–28),22 underscoring Israel's violation of the covenant relationship with God and continuing the covenantal motif seen previously in Amos 2:9–11; 3:1–2. The Lord has judged them in the same manner as he did their great enemy, Egypt (4:10). This allusion to the punishment of Egypt places the northern kingdom in the same category as Egypt: they are God's enemy. Israel's stubborn rebelliousness is the central point of this passage. Just like

<sup>20</sup> For the historical significance of Gilgal, see Joshua 4:19–5:10.

<span id="page-332-14"></span><span id="page-332-2"></span><sup>21</sup> Every occurrence of the Hebrew word "overthrow" (v. 11) in the OT appears in a context referring to Sodom and Gomorrah (Deut. 29:23; Isa. 1:7–10; 13:19; Jer. 49:18; 50:40). The comparisons of Israel with Sodom and Gomorrah are meant to be a shocking condemnation of God's people, and help to explain the severity of God's judgment.

<span id="page-332-1"></span><sup>22</sup> See Hans Walter Wolff, *Joel and Amos*, Hermeneia (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1989), 213, for a comparison of the curses of Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 with Amos 4. See also Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, xxxii–xlii, for his list of covenant curses in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-333-2"></span><span id="page-333-1"></span>their forefathers in the wilderness, they remain a "stiff-necked" people (cf. Ex. 32:9; 33:3, 5; 34:9), refusing to learn from God's chastisement. As they have hardened their hearts against God, he now gives them over to their idolatrous ways, which will end in destruction (cf. Rom. 1:18–32).

<span id="page-333-8"></span><span id="page-333-5"></span><span id="page-333-4"></span>4:12–13 The Lord's faithfulness to the covenant requires punitive action against Israel in the fullest measure. Since they have not heeded his warnings ("therefore"; v. 12), God will do "this" to them. "This" refers to his personal visitation: "Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!" This powerfully haunting statement evokes the image of the holy God entering into the midst of Israel in order to destroy them. This appears to be an allusion to Exodus 19, where the nation assembled at Sinai to enter into covenant with the Lord. Before God gave them the law by speaking directly to them, they had to prepare to encounter the Holy One (Ex. 19:7–15). Ironically, Amos indicates that now they are to prepare to meet God for punishment, not blessing. And the previous sample punishments (Amos 4:6–11) do not come close to what is now coming. This time, the Lord's visitation will bring the nation to an end. To quote Stuart, "You haven't seen anything yet."23

<span id="page-333-6"></span><span id="page-333-0"></span>"Your God" is described in verse 13, which has often been called a doxology. He is the Creator who "forms the mountains" and "creates the wind." He reveals who he is ("declares to man what is his thought"), controls everything ("makes the morning darkness") and is everywhere present ("treads on the heights of the earth"). There is no escaping this God, and Yahweh, "the God of hosts, is his name!" "Hosts" (*tseba'ot*) refers to armies (3:13; 5:14, 15, 16, 27; 6:8, 14; 9:5), evoking militaristic imagery regarding God's coming. The coming judgment is seen in the Lord's sovereign employment not merely of earthly armies but, ultimately, of his heavenly armies.

### <span id="page-333-7"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-333-3"></span>Israel's covenantal relationship with God plays out in this chapter as the Lord chastises the people for their unfaithfulness, a chastisement purposed to turn them back to him. The Lord keeps his part of the covenant (e.g., by being faithful and punishing sin), even though the people refuse to repent. God keeps his word, and he will do exactly what he says. His swearing by "his holiness" (4:2) stresses the certainty with which he will act. This is true equally regarding both curses and blessings. God will judge all mankind for sin, but he will also save all who repent and turn to Christ. Wonderfully, the book of Hebrews highlights this very thing:

When God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, *he swore by himself*, saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you." And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise. For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. *So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his*  *purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath*, so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. (Heb. 6:13–20)

<span id="page-334-6"></span>God has sworn by himself to save his people, which he has done fully in Jesus Christ.

<span id="page-334-1"></span>We also see that God's warnings should lead us to repentance. Just as God sent punishment against Israel (Amos 4:6–11) in order to lead them back to himself, so God shows human beings their sins and calls them to turn from the wrath to come. It is the responsibility of men and women to turn to God, for his patience does not last forever. It is possible for people to harden their hearts against God to the extent that he gives them over to their wickedness. Paul speaks of God's giving mankind up "in the lusts of their hearts" (Rom. 1:24), "to dishonorable passions" (1:26), and "to a debased mind" (1:28). Thankfully, the Lord is able to save us out of our depravity, but he may also leave us in it instead. Just as he gave Israel over to their wickedness (Amos 4:4–6), so he may do to those who continue to refuse him.

<span id="page-334-5"></span><span id="page-334-4"></span><span id="page-334-0"></span>Notably, the Israelites frequented shrines in order to offer worship. They were going through the motions—performing rituals, paying tithes, offering praises but it meant nothing because it was not from hearts that loved God and desired to keep his commandments. In contrast, Jesus highlights the nature of true worship when he says to the Samaritan woman, "The hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth" (John 4:23–24).

<span id="page-334-8"></span><span id="page-334-7"></span><span id="page-334-3"></span><span id="page-334-2"></span>The prospect of meeting God while yet in our sin is a sobering thing. When the Lord warned, "Prepare to meet your God, O Israel" (Amos 4:12), terror should have struck their rebellious hearts—and the same is true for us if we are in rebellion against him. As the author of Hebrews states to those who have turned away from Jesus, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:31). But the threat of judgment is removed for those who embrace Christ from the heart. That means putting our trust in him, the One who has taken the judgment that our sin and rebellion deserve. In Christ we meet God and are not undone. We know the blessing of God's presence, not the curse of his judgment. Such a glorious truth leads to true worship: "Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire" (Heb. 12:28–29).

## AMOS 5:1–27

<span id="page-335-0"></span>5 Hear this word that I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:

**<sup>2</sup>** "Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel; forsaken on her land, with none to raise her up."

**<sup>3</sup>**For thus says the Lord God:

"The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went out a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel."

**<sup>4</sup>**For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel:

"Seek me and live;

- **<sup>5</sup>** but do not seek Bethel, and do not enter into Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall come to nothing."
- **<sup>6</sup>** Seek the Lord and live, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,
- **<sup>7</sup>** O you who turn justice to wormwood*<sup>1</sup>* and cast down righteousness to the earth!
- **<sup>8</sup>** He who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens the day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth,
- the Lord is his name;
- **<sup>9</sup>** who makes destruction flash forth against the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
- **<sup>10</sup>** They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks the truth.
- **<sup>11</sup>** Therefore because you trample on*<sup>2</sup>* the poor and you exact taxes of grain from him,

 you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine.

- **<sup>12</sup>** For I know how many are your transgressions and how great are your sins you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and turn aside the needy in the gate.
- **<sup>13</sup>** Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time, for it is an evil time.
- **<sup>14</sup>** Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said.
- **<sup>15</sup>** Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,
- will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
- **<sup>16</sup>**Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord:

"In all the squares there shall be wailing, and in all the streets they shall say, 'Alas! Alas!' They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation,

**<sup>17</sup>** and in all vineyards there shall be wailing, for I will pass through your midst,"

says the Lord.

**<sup>18</sup>** Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord! Why would you have the day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light,

**<sup>19</sup>** as if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him, or went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall, and a serpent bit him.

**<sup>20</sup>** Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light, and gloom with no brightness in it?

## **<sup>21</sup>** "I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.

- **<sup>22</sup>** Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; and the peace offerings of your fattened animals,
- I will not look upon them. **<sup>23</sup>** Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen.
- **<sup>24</sup>** But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

**<sup>25</sup>** "Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? **26**You shall take up Sikkuth your king,

and Kiyyun your star-god—your images that you made for yourselves, **<sup>27</sup>** and I will send you into exile beyond Damascus," says the Lord, whose name is the God of hosts.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-337-1"></span>Amos 5 consists of two main sections. The first comprises 5:1–17, the last oracle that begins with the imperative "Hear!" The unity of this section is especially evident due to its chiastic nature (in which the main points of the passage are repeated in reverse order):

- A. Lamentation (vv. 1–3)
	- B. Call to Seek the Lord (vv. 4–6)
		- C. Indictments (v. 7)
			- D. Hymn (vv. 8–9)
		- C'. Indictments (vv. 10–13)
	- B'. Call to Seek the Lord (vv. 14–15)
- A'. Lamentation (vv. 16–17)

<span id="page-337-4"></span>The second section of this passage is 5:18–27, the first of two "woe" oracles (cf. 6:1–7), consisting of an announcement of the day of the Lord (5:18–20) and the rejection of Israel's hypocritical worship (5:21–27).

<span id="page-337-5"></span>Taken together, the two sections in chapter 5 underscore the certainty of God's judgment. The first section is a lamentation, but an ironic one, since this lamentation is not so much a grieving over the fall of the nation as a denouncement against it. Similarly, the woe oracle of the second section depicts the coming day of the Lord—to which the Israelites were apparently looking forward as a day of deliverance—as a day of darkness, not light, a day in which they would be held accountable for their idolatries and injustices. The judgment in view is exile "beyond Damascus" (v. 27); they had abandoned the covenant and could no longer remain in the covenant land.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-337-3"></span><span id="page-337-2"></span><span id="page-337-0"></span>5:1–3 The imperative "Hear!" begins the chapter (v. 1), linking this passage with the previous two chapters (3:1, 13; 4:1), but it is unclear whether the immediate speaker is Amos or the Lord himself. Regardless, "this word" to which the people must listen is the "lamentation" that follows. A "lamentation" is an elegy or a dirge said or sung upon the death of an individual. It usually conveys grief and sorrow over

<span id="page-338-6"></span>loss (8:10), but this lamentation in 4:1–17 does not. Instead, it functions more as a prophetic denouncement of the nation and an announcement of its coming death.

<span id="page-338-8"></span>The lamentation begins (5:2) by announcing that Israel has fallen as though dying, lacking the strength or ability to get back up. This expression of certain collapse is accentuated by referring to the nation as "the virgin Israel," conveying a sense of tragedy that the nation has fallen in the prime of her life. She is a like a young girl with so much potential and possibility, her life cut short before marriage or childbearing. It is a tragic picture of a people who did not achieve their God-intended purpose in life.

<span id="page-338-9"></span><span id="page-338-2"></span>What is more, she is forsaken in her own "land." Israel's home turf, the divine gift of Canaan, is the very ground upon which she will be destroyed. No one is able to help her ("with none to raise her up"). In verse 3, this "fall" is presented in militaristic terms: multiples of ten are military units (2 Sam. 18:1).24 The diminishing numbers of those who exit the city ("thousand" → "hundred" → "ten") portray a dwindling army, cut down by the enemy, until very few remain. The message of these verses is clear: the defeat of Israel will be devastating.

<span id="page-338-16"></span><span id="page-338-15"></span><span id="page-338-14"></span><span id="page-338-13"></span><span id="page-338-11"></span><span id="page-338-4"></span>5:4–7 The chapter continues with the formulaic expression "For thus says the Lord . . ." (cf. vv. 3, 16). Now the Lord directly addresses "the house of Israel" (v. 4), pleading, "Seek me and live." These terms occur again in verse 6, and a third imperative in verse 14 is synonymous ("Seek good, and not evil, that you may live"). Some interpret this call to "seek God" as contradictory to the certainty of judgment seen in the previous verses.25 Others see the call as addressing not the whole nation but the righteous remnant still faithful to the Lord (cf. 5:15).26 In the light of Jeremiah 18:1–18, etc., others believe that until judgment comes there is always a chance that the Lord might still show mercy to the people.27 Admittedly, there is an inevitability of judgment in the prophetic message of Amos. However, the first two interpretations just summarized appear to be too strong in their view of the certainty of judgment. Verse 4 should be read not as contradictory to verses 1–3 but as complementary. Also, God's call to respond does not appear to be limited to one sector of Israel, the righteous. This call in verse 4 is made to all who would hear and respond. To say that this is a call only to the faithful seems to diminish the compassion of God, who calls all to seek him and live (Isa. 55:6–7; Ezek. 18:23; Jonah 3:4–5, 10; Acts 17:30). He desires mankind to turn to him to avoid his judgment and to experience life under his good pleasure.

<span id="page-338-12"></span><span id="page-338-10"></span><span id="page-338-5"></span><span id="page-338-3"></span>The object of Amos 5:4 stands out: "Seek *me* and live." The people are to seek the Lord himself, which should be understood as knowing God and keeping his word (cf. vv. 14–15). God commands them in verse 5 not to go to Bethel, Gilgal, or Beersheba.28 It is clear from 4:4 that Bethel and Gilgal were places of sinful wor-

<span id="page-338-1"></span><span id="page-338-0"></span><sup>28</sup> For Bethel, see Genesis 12:8; 35:1; for Gilgal, see Joshua 4:19–5:10; for Beersheba, see Genesis 21:33; 26:23–25; 46:1. Beersheba had become a place of religious pilgrimage (2 Kings 23:8; Amos 8:14).

ship, suggesting the same was true of Beersheba. Indeed, Gilgal and Bethel will be destroyed: Gilgal will "go into exile"29 and Bethel will "come to nothing" (lit., "come to disaster/sorrow"). They will not find the Lord by continuing in their sinful ways.

<span id="page-339-8"></span><span id="page-339-6"></span>The second imperative, "Seek the Lord and live" (5:6), provides a rationale for doing so: so that he will not "break out like fire in the house of Joseph." The "house of Joseph" should be viewed as referring not only to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh but to the entire northern kingdom (cf. v. 4, "the house of Israel"). The purpose of this fire is to "devour" Bethel because of the false worship that takes place there. Fire was the recurring judgment declared against the Gentile nations and Judah in the first two chapters (1:4, 7, 10, 12, 14; 2:2, 5). Now the Lord calls Israel to seek him so that this judgment will not come upon them. The mention of Bethel three times in 5:5–6 highlights the central role it played in the aberrant religious practices of the northern kingdom. It has become synonymous with idolatry itself.

<span id="page-339-9"></span><span id="page-339-7"></span><span id="page-339-3"></span>The indictment of verse 7 comes right on the heels of the imperative of verse 6 and should be read as a continuation of the previous verses. In other words, the call to seek the Lord (in v. 6) is directed toward the wicked (in v. 7) "who turn justice to wormwood and cast down righteousness to the earth." Wormwood produces exceptionally bitter oil and functions as a metaphor for bitterness in the OT. Justice should be sweet, but when corrupted it becomes bitter. This verse summons those engaged in injustice and unrighteousness to seek the Lord while he may be found and to turn from their immoral ways.

<span id="page-339-11"></span><span id="page-339-10"></span><span id="page-339-5"></span>5:8–9 These verses form the center of the chiasm of 5:1–17 (cf. Section Overview). Their hymnic nature has led some to suggest that they were originally part of an ancient hymn, adapted by Amos for this passage. These verses exalt the Lord as the maker of the heavenly constellations, the one who controls the waters of the seas and brings destruction upon the land. Verse 8 contributes to this theme by describing the Lord as the creator and sustainer of the universe ("He who made . . . and turns . . ."). The constellations Pleiades and Orion represent the creational work of God (Job 9:9; 38:31; Isa. 40:26), and their mention may also be a polemic against astral worship. If so, the clear implication is that these constellations are not gods but entities created by the Lord.

<span id="page-339-2"></span>The Lord also controls the patterns of time ("turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens the day into night") and nature ("calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth").30 Thus he providentially sustains the events of creation. Functioning like a refrain, "The Lord is his name" stands as the climax of this passage. The Lord is the one with whom the Israelites must reckon (cf. Heb. 4:13). This statement, along with the motifs of creation, light, and darkness, connects this hymnic passage with the doxology in Amos 4:13 and the hymn in 9:5–6.

<span id="page-339-13"></span><span id="page-339-12"></span><span id="page-339-4"></span><span id="page-339-1"></span><span id="page-339-0"></span><sup>29</sup> There is a play on words here in Hebrew, as the words for "Gilgal" and "go into exile" sound very similar. 30 These statements could also be echoes of God's judgments in the ninth plague against Egypt (Ex. 10:21–29) and in the flood (Genesis 6–8), respectively.

<span id="page-340-4"></span>Verse 9 concludes this passage by describing the Lord as the one who destroys "the strong" and "the fortress." The God who created and sustains all things is also the one who judges, and no matter how strong and fortified a nation may appear, it cannot stand in his way.

<span id="page-340-6"></span><span id="page-340-3"></span>5:10–13 The indictments introduced generically in verse 7 become more specific in these four verses. The "gate" (vv. 10, 12) of the city was the place of business and legal transaction. It represented the place where all parties stood on equal footing before the law, and the offended party (often the poor) could expect justice to win the day through the decree of an impartial judge. But the corruption of the legal system had become so great in Amos's day that even honesty in a court of law had become loathsome to people. The unjust are accused of hating and rejecting those who are truthful and stand for righteousness (v. 10). Verse 12 highlights similar abuses: the people "afflict the righteous," "take a bribe," and "turn aside the needy in the gate." Abhorrence of truth and perversion of the legal system are always marks of injustice.

<span id="page-340-8"></span><span id="page-340-7"></span>Verse 11 explains the consequences of their treachery ("Therefore . . ."). Since they have trampled upon the poor and levied unfair taxes on them, these offenders will face ironic justice. The opulent amenities they have purchased with their unjust wealth will be lost. They will not enjoy the "stone" (i.e., luxurious) houses they built or the "wine" from the "pleasant vineyards" they planted. Someone else will rob them of these treasures, and they will experience the afflictions they imposed upon others. These judgments are reminiscent of the covenant curses in Deuteronomy 28:30, 39: "You shall build a house, but you shall not dwell in it. You shall plant a vineyard, but you shall not enjoy its fruit. . . . You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worm shall eat them."

<span id="page-340-13"></span><span id="page-340-9"></span><span id="page-340-5"></span><span id="page-340-0"></span>The final verse of this unit (Amos 5:13) has been understood in different ways. Some view it as a powerful statement of the equity of God's retribution against Israel, that the "prudent" or wise will remain silent when judgment comes because they know that what the nation has sown, it will now reap (Gal. 6:7–10). A different approach is that of Billy Smith, who suggests that, in view of the people's rejection of truth (Amos 5:10), the "point could be that the times were such that wise men, who in better times would be consulted for their wisdom, were silent because no one would listen" (cf. Matt. 7:6). Or, in a related way, it could mean that the wise man "knew how to avoid trouble, in which case silence would be the best policy in such evil times."31

<span id="page-340-12"></span><span id="page-340-11"></span><span id="page-340-2"></span><span id="page-340-1"></span>5:14–15 These verses contain the final call, in the lamentation of 5:1–17, to respond to God. Similarly to verses 4 and 6, God calls his hearers to "seek." In those verses, he exhorted the Israelites, "Seek me and live. . . . Seek the Lord and live!" In verse 14, however, he exhorts, "Seek good [*tob*], and not evil [*raʻ*], that you

<span id="page-340-10"></span><sup>31</sup> Smith and Page, *Amos, Obadiah, Jonah*, 105.

<span id="page-341-6"></span><span id="page-341-4"></span>may live." This is clearly parallel to the earlier commands (cf. Section Overview), underscoring the fact that seeking the Lord (vv. 4, 6) is not a mystical endeavor or a simple engagement in religious ritual but is done by means of righteous living, i.e., loving God and keeping his commands (seeking "good"; v. 14). Sadly, the people were doing the opposite; their evil ways revealed they did not know God or love him. As a result, their worship rituals were futile, and the Lord was not "with" them as they claimed (v. 14). However, if they would truly seek him, "the God of hosts"—the Divine Warrior King (cf. 3:13)—would be in their midst, for their good and not their harm.

<span id="page-341-11"></span><span id="page-341-1"></span>This is further reiterated in 5:15 by the command to "Hate evil [*raʻ*],and love good [*tob*]." Note the reversal of "good" and "evil" from verse 14 to verse 15. To seek "good" means to forsake "evil," and to hate "evil" means to love "good." No middle ground exists between the two. The people are either for God or against him (cf. Matt. 12:30). If they are for him, they will seek to obey his righteous commands. A third imperative in Amos 5:15 shows practically what it means to hate evil and love good: "Establish justice in the gate." God calls the Israelites to turn to him and reform their ways by bringing equity back to the legal system of the land (cf. comment on 5:10–13).

<span id="page-341-7"></span><span id="page-341-5"></span><span id="page-341-2"></span>The possibility of mercy marks the end of this call (v. 15). If they seek the Lord, hate evil, and return justice to "the gate," then "the God of hosts" may show mercy to "the remnant of Joseph." Even at this point, the Lord's graciousness and compassion abounds. In the light of Israel's unfaithfulness and rebellion, Exodus 34:6–7 still rings true:

<span id="page-341-0"></span>The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.

<span id="page-341-9"></span><span id="page-341-3"></span>5:16–17 The final section of the lamentation (5:1–17) begins with the formula, "Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord . . ." Note the threefold reference to God: "the Lord" (Yahweh), "the God of hosts," and "the Lord" (*'adonay*). The fullness of this title seems to underscore the gravity of the message to follow. The title "God of hosts" (*tseba'ot*) occurs for the third time in three consecutive verses (v. 16; cf. vv. 14, 15), accentuating the image of God as military conqueror (cf. comment on 3:13).

<span id="page-341-10"></span><span id="page-341-8"></span>It is so obvious that Israel will reject the plea to seek the Lord (5:14–15) that God announces in verses 16–17 that lamentation will be heard throughout the land. The term "wailing" occurs three times in these verses, along with three additional expressions or terms of lament: "Alas! Alas!," "mourning," and "lamentation" (v. 16). This theme of lamenting in verses 1 and 16–17 frames the entire lamentation of 5:1–17, bringing unity to the passage. The wailing will be heard throughout the land: in town squares, farms (v. 16), and vineyards (v. 17). There <span id="page-342-9"></span>will be so much death that farmers (who usually sing at the harvest) must be summoned to aid professional mourners in their singing of dirges (v. 16).

<span id="page-342-0"></span>God declares that his visitation is the reason for all the lamentation over the dead: "For I will pass through your midst" (v. 17). The Egyptian Passover event in Exodus provides the background for this statement. In Exodus 12:12, the Lord states, "For *I will pass through* the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord." When the Lord "passed through" the midst of Egypt, only those with the blood of the Passover lamb on their doorposts were "passed over" and spared from God's wrath: "The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt" (Ex. 12:13). Now, in Amos, God will not "pass over" the Israelites (cf. Amos 7:8); he will "pass through" their midst, and mourning will follow. This is a devastating picture, once again comparing the northern kingdom to God's ancient enemy—Egypt (4:10).

<span id="page-342-11"></span><span id="page-342-7"></span><span id="page-342-6"></span><span id="page-342-1"></span>5:18–20 God's coming visitation mentioned in 4:13 and 5:17 is now referred to as "the day of the Lord" three times in verses 18 and 20. However, there appears to be a clear misconception regarding this "day" among the Israelites of Amos's time. The prophet pronounces "woe" upon those who expectantly look forward to the day of the Lord. The "woe" of verse 18 begins the first of two woe oracles in the book of Amos (5:18–27; 6:1–7), and it is a threatening cry of grief. The people's "desire" to see this day shows that they believe God will save Israel and deliver her from her enemies on that day. Amos, however, corrects this wrong theology by declaring that the day of the Lord entails Israel's own destruction.

<span id="page-342-12"></span><span id="page-342-5"></span><span id="page-342-4"></span>The day of the Lord has both negative and positive connotations in the OT. It can refer to God's coming salvation (Jer. 30:3; 31:31; Zech. 14:9) or to his coming judgment (Joel 2:1–2; Obad. 15), both temporally and eschatologically. In these verses of Amos the day of the Lord patently refers to God's punishment of the covenant people for their unfaithfulness. Those who long for that day are ironically longing for destruction.

<span id="page-342-13"></span><span id="page-342-10"></span><span id="page-342-3"></span><span id="page-342-2"></span>This passage stresses the nature of that day by contrasting darkness and light. In the OT, "light" points to life and salvation (Pss. 27:1; Isa. 9:2), while "darkness" indicates death and destruction (Ps. 88:18; 91:6; Isa. 8:22). Amos calls this day "darkness, and not light" twice in these verses (Amos 5:18, 20). In between these two statements, he emphasizes the inevitability of the coming judgment (v. 19). It will be like a man who escapes from a lion, only to be confronted by a bear, or like one who goes into the safety of his home, only to be killed by a snake within it. Such pictures point to the certainty of death. There will be no hope for Israel in that day, for the day of the Lord will be the day of reckoning.

<span id="page-342-14"></span><span id="page-342-8"></span>5:21–24 These verses address the unacceptable worship of Israel (cf. vv. 4–5). God vigorously rejects their religious rituals: "I hate, I despise . . . I take no delight . . . <span id="page-343-4"></span><span id="page-343-1"></span>I will not accept . . . I will not look upon . . . Take away from me . . . I will not listen." The people's numerous religious activities may have been vibrant and even commanded by the law (Leviticus 1–3; 23), but they were both mixed with pagan idolatry and undermined by the people's wicked treatment of the poor. Thus the Lord spurns their hypocritical worship and calls them to holiness instead: "But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream" (Amos 5:24). In Israel, wadis or riverbeds would overflow in the rainy seasons and then dry up soon after the rains had ceased. In terms of justice and righteousness, the nation is pictured as a bone-dry wadi; they have been guilty of corrupting "justice" and "righteousness" (5:7; 6:12). So, God calls for a permanent flow of justice and righteousness in Israelite society ("like an ever-flowing stream") rather than a drought of godliness. The Lord desires them to repent of their injustices and live in covenant faithfulness with him and one another. In other words, God seeks not their perpetually vain rituals but their consistent loving obedience.

<span id="page-343-6"></span><span id="page-343-3"></span>5:25–27 These verses have proved to be a great challenge for scholars—both their translation and their interpretation. Two main ways of interpreting verse 25 have been suggested. According to the first, the expected answer to the question of verse 25 is "no," not because Israel never presented sacrifices to the Lord, but because their relationship with God was not solely (or even primarily) about sacrifice; it was about covenant love for the Lord (Jer. 7:21–23).32 Some in this camp understand the sense to be, "Did you *only* bring sacrifices? No! You brought love and faithfulness, justice and righteousness! That is true covenant religion! And that is what you need now!"

<span id="page-343-2"></span><span id="page-343-0"></span>According to the second way of understanding this passage, the expected answer to the question is also "no," but because the sacrifices the Israelites offered were idolatrous and thus not made properly to the Lord (as with the golden calf in Exodus 32 and the incident at Baal-peor in Numbers 25). In other words, the people in the wilderness quickly turned away from the Lord and corrupted the worship he had commanded. This interpretation, which is less common, suggests that Amos 5:25 highlights the covenant unfaithfulness of the nation even from its conception.33

<span id="page-343-7"></span><span id="page-343-5"></span>There are further difficulties in verse 26, especially in terms of translation. With only slight changes, the word "Sikkuth" could be read as "booth/tabernacle," while the word "your king" could be read as "Moloch." This is what the Septuagint translators did: "You took up the tent of Moloch . . ."34

Nevertheless, it seems best to follow the Hebrew text. Kiyyun was an Assyrian god identified with the planet Saturn, and some view Sikkuth as a parallel

<sup>33</sup> See ibid., 326–328, for Smith's discussion on the difficulties and options regarding these verses.

<span id="page-343-8"></span><sup>34</sup> Stephen quotes the Septuagint version in his speech in Acts 7 (vv. 42–43). It was common, however, for the Septuagint—which is in Greek—to be quoted in the Greek NT. NT authors are not necessarily endorsing every translational choice the Septuagint made; sometimes they are simply seeking to get their main point across. In this instance, even though there are differences between the two, both the Septuagint and the Hebrew text are clear in condemning Israel's past pagan worship.

<span id="page-344-5"></span><span id="page-344-2"></span>reference, since he is identified as the Mesopotamian god Ninurta (a god also associated with Saturn).35 The description of Kiyyun as "your star-god" in the text further supports the idea that astral worship is in view. In addition, the possible polemic against astral worship in the mention of God's creation of the Pleiades and Orion (v. 8) further supports the notion that verse 26 refers to the worship of heavenly bodies. The Israelites will take up their idols of astral deities—which they made with their own hands—and carry them on their journey into exile "beyond Damascus" (v. 27). The phrase "beyond Damascus" points to the captivity they will experience in the foreign land of Assyria. It is a punishment fitting the crime: the people will worship their Assyrian astral gods in the land of Assyria! The gravity of the message is underscored by the closing words, where a fairly full title is again used to describe "the Lord," the one "whose name is the God of hosts" and who will thus bring about this defeat of Israel (cf. vv. 16–17).

### <span id="page-344-3"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-344-1"></span>One of the central tenets of this chapter is the need to "seek the Lord and live." Even though Israel had abandoned the Lord, God called them to seek him and thereby find life. The grace and patience of God stand out amid rebellion and wickedness; until judgment finally comes, the Lord receives all who will turn to him. What a wonderful picture of the love of God for sinners in the middle of a prophetic book full of doom! God's mercy is great and his compassion beyond words. As the Lord states in Ezekiel 18:23, "Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord God, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?" Isaiah 55:6–7 similarly declares, "Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord, that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." The Lord Jesus himself said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:12; cf. Amos 5:18–20).

<span id="page-344-4"></span><span id="page-344-0"></span>A second theme in this chapter is the hypocritical and idolatrous worship of Israel. The people did not worship God according to his word, and their disobedience to God's law (especially seen in their mistreatment of their fellow human beings) revealed the emptiness of their worship. Those who truly know God will also seek to live according to his word, in both worship and practice.

<span id="page-344-6"></span>In our present day, emphasis on obedience in the Christian life is often avoided for fear of legalism or moralism. Certainly, emphasis upon obedience apart from the context of grace becomes moralistic and oppressive. But the Scriptures never downplay or mince words concerning the necessity of faithfulness. Obedience is the fruit of true faith, and love for both God and man is the basis of the moral law (Matt. 22:34–40). If we correctly understand justification as being by faith alone, then our pursuit of obedience (i.e., sanctification) becomes the consequence of our <span id="page-345-3"></span><span id="page-345-2"></span><span id="page-345-1"></span>salvation in Christ, not the means of it.36 Faith and obedience are not mutually exclusive: faith without works is a dead faith (James 2:17, 26), and works apart from justifying faith are futile (Gal. 2:16). Those who are truly God's children will look increasingly more like Christ as they grow in the grace and knowledge of him. But those who claim to worship God while living in unfaithful rebellion are actually like the Israelites of Amos's day. The Lord of hosts, whom they claim to worship, is the very one to whom they will give an account (Heb. 4:13).

## AMOS 6:1–14

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-346-1"></span>The dreadful nature of Amos 6 begins with its first word: "Woe!" This initial expression of lament simply introduces what is perhaps the darkest and most terrifying chapter in this prophetic book. Accusation against the complacency of the capital cities (vv. 1–7) leads to an extreme expression of the Lord's hatred of the people's arrogance and an ominous picture of the aftermath of God's wrath (vv. 8–14). The devastation revealed in verses 9–10 will be thorough and will come as a result of the Lord's raising up a foreign nation against Israel to tyrannize them throughout the land (vv. 11–14).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-346-5"></span><span id="page-346-3"></span><span id="page-346-0"></span>6:1–3 As with the previous oracle (5:18), the use of the lament "Woe," as customary in Amos, commences this oracle, which begins by addressing the careless indifference of Israel's elite. While there is a shift in focus from security to complacency in 6:4, the entirety of 6:1–7 should be viewed as a unified passage with two complementary parts. The repetition of the root meaning "first, finest" in verses 6:1 (*re'shit*), 6:6 (*re'shit*), and 6:7 (*ro'sh*) binds the text together as God condemns Israel for its self-confidence and self-indulgence.

<span id="page-346-7"></span><span id="page-346-6"></span><span id="page-346-2"></span>The false sense of security of the people is highlighted in verse 1, which describes "those who are at ease in Zion, . . . who feel secure on the mountain of <span id="page-347-8"></span><span id="page-347-3"></span><span id="page-347-2"></span>Samaria." "Zion" refers to Jerusalem, which seems odd in a book predominately addressing the northern kingdom of Israel. However, the prophets have been known to speak to both the northern and southern kingdoms while nevertheless primarily addressing one kingdom or the other (Hos. 5:12, 14; 6:4–11; Amos 2:4–5). Amos's words apply to the self-confident nobility ("the notable men") of Samaria, and such transgressors in the southern capital of Jerusalem are equally liable to judgment (cf. Mic. 1:2–9). To be "at ease" conveys a sense of careless comfort in the belief that there is no cause for concern. The feeling of being secure on the "mountain of Samaria" underscores this comfort. Both capital cities were built on a mountain, which significantly increased their fortification and sense of security. However, God insinuates that these fortified cities, especially Samaria, will fall.

The people are commanded to look at three cities that were once great, secure places but are no longer so. Calneh and Hamath were eastern cities of Syria, while Gath was formerly one of the great five Philistine strongholds. By Amos's time each had fallen into the hands of other nations. God hypothetically asks if Israel is greater than these previous strongholds. The clearly implied answer is "no." Just as these powerful cities have fallen, so will Israel. Amos 6:3 then addresses the selfassured leadership's rejection of these warnings. They "put far away" the coming judgment by denying its possibility, but the fall of these other great cities bears witness to the pending doom of Israel.

<span id="page-347-4"></span>Denial of the coming disaster actually serves to "bring near the seat of violence." The meaning of this phrase is debated. It could mean that by denying the coming disaster (and refusing to repent), the people hasten the arrival of the day of the Lord (and thus the violence of the judgment they will receive from the nations he sends against them). Alternately, it could mean that by denying the coming disaster (and refusing to repent), the people are encouraging further wicked and unjust behavior (violence). In either case, denying the Lord's coming judgment will have a tremendously negative impact on society.

<span id="page-347-7"></span><span id="page-347-6"></span><span id="page-347-5"></span><span id="page-347-1"></span><span id="page-347-0"></span>6:4–7 In the Hebrew, verse 4 begins simply with a reference to "those who lie on beds," but since this verse is a continuation of the woe oracle, the ESV has added the word "woe" to make the connection clear. The oracle is now directed toward the self-indulgent decadence of Israel's elite. They are pictured as sprawled out on their luxurious furniture ("beds of ivory" and "couches"), feasting on the choicest meats available. Most of the population ate meat only a few times a year, particularly at feasts, because it was so expensive. These privileged few, however, gave themselves to continual feasting and hedonistic pleasure. And since they were extravagantly wealthy, they used their abundant free time to sing "idle songs" and invent "instruments of music," just like the most notable royal of all—David (v. 5). In other words, they partied like the greatest of royalty, but the irony here should not be missed: David employed music to worship the Lord (2 Sam. 23:1; 2 Chron. 7:6), not in order to engage in unrestrained debauchery.

<span id="page-348-6"></span><span id="page-348-0"></span>The people may have had the material blessings of King David, but they did not share his spiritual inclinations toward God (1 Sam. 13:14; 16:7). Furthermore, their engagement in these decadent festivities ("drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the finest oils") occurs without the slightest concern for the condition of their land (Amos 6:6). They are so self-consumed in their revelry that they "are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph"—that is, over their own coming ruin.37 Because of its wanton apathy and narcissistic hedonism, the nobility will lead the way into exile, and their "revelry . . . shall pass away." In this case, the first shall not be last; the first shall be first!38

<span id="page-348-12"></span><span id="page-348-8"></span><span id="page-348-2"></span>6:8–10 These verses provide the exclamation point of the chapter by describing God's abhorrence of Israel's immoral condition and the devastating aftermath of his judgment. In the form of an oath, the Lord declares that he will destroy the city, and the death toll will be catastrophic. Verse 8 ("The Lord God has sworn by himself") is the second of three oath formulas in the book of Amos. In 4:2 God swore by "his holiness," and in 8:7 he will swear by "the pride of Jacob." In order to grasp the monumental message of this verse, the resoluteness with which oaths were taken in the ancient Near East should not be overlooked. As Gary Smith comments, "Oaths were taken seriously. A person was required to carry out an oath no matter how painful it might be."39 And since the "God of hosts" swears by himself, the unchangeable nature of this oath becomes even more explicit (cf. 4:2; Heb. 6:13–20).40

<span id="page-348-13"></span><span id="page-348-7"></span><span id="page-348-5"></span>The Lord abhors and hates (cf. Amos 5:21) the militaristic conceit of Israel. In 6:8, the phrase "the pride of Jacob" (cf. 8:7) is parallel to "his strongholds," indicating that the nation's confidence is not in the God of hosts who fights for them but in their own defensive prowess. The double statement of the Lord's hatred of Israel's arrogance stresses the intensity of his judgment. He promises to shatter their "pride" by delivering up "the city" and everything in it. The city in view is Samaria, but as the capital, its fate reflects that of the entire nation.

<span id="page-348-10"></span><span id="page-348-9"></span><span id="page-348-4"></span>Amos 6:9–10 should be read as a figurative illustration portraying the horrifying outcome of God's visitation in judgment (i.e., the day of the Lord; cf. 5:18–20). The "if" in 6:9 marks these verses as an example of the type of devastation that will be experienced: "If ten men remain in one house, they shall die." These "ten men" could be a reference to the smallest military unit in Israel, implying utter desolation of the army. However, this could refer instead to ordinary citizens who may have made it through part of the disaster but will nonetheless meet their end. In either case, the point is that death will be comprehensive when judgment comes.

<span id="page-348-11"></span>Verse 10 provides a "what is more . . ." elaboration on this outcome. When those responsible for burying the dead come to the house, they will ask, "Is there still anyone with you?" Some commentators have been concerned to identify the

<span id="page-349-7"></span>figure being addressed. Was he already in the house? Or, since verse 9 says that all in the house will die, did he accompany the relative to the house? There is no need, however, to be overly concerned with this question, since the illustration is figurative and not meant to be minutely parsed. The purpose of the imagery is to reveal that death will be extensive, and those who search for the bodies will see its full extent.

The person's response is startling. He says simply, "No." No one remains. Then he interjects, "Silence! We must not mention the name of the Lord." This prohibition is not to imply that saying the actual name of God is forbidden; the responder himself uses the name "the Lord." Instead, it may mean that it is too late to invoke the name of the Lord in the form of lamentation or pleading. The deed has been done. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as a statement of fear of calling out to him in prayer: "Yahweh will have become foe, not friend. Survivors will want him to stay away, not come back."41 Either way, the severity of this calamity provokes a sense of terror in those who witness the aftermath of God's wrath.

<span id="page-349-10"></span><span id="page-349-9"></span><span id="page-349-8"></span><span id="page-349-6"></span>6:11–14 These verses grab our attention ("For behold") following the ruinous portrait of the land in verses 9–10. The devastating fall has clearly come from the Lord, at whose command great and small "houses" alike are shattered into "fragments" and "bits." The term "house" (vv. 9, 10, 11[2x], 14) helps to tie this second half of the chapter together (vv. 8–14). The idea is not merely that judgment will come upon individual houses of every size (vv. 9, 10, 11), but that the nation—the "house" of Israel—will be toppled as well (v. 14). Both scenarios emphasize the same point: the destruction will be complete and overwhelming.

<span id="page-349-13"></span>Two hypothetical questions then follow in verse 12. The idea of horses running on rock or oxen plowing rock is ludicrous—it would be unthinkable to do such things. How much more, implies the Lord, has Israel done the unthinkable: they "have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood" (cf. 5:17).42 It is beyond belief that those who have received both the grace and the law of God would corrupt the legal system to meet their own sinful ends, but such is the case (5:10–13). This is the exact opposite of what should have happened.

<span id="page-349-4"></span><span id="page-349-3"></span><span id="page-349-2"></span><span id="page-349-0"></span>Note that the phrase "fruit of righteousness" (6:12) refers to the outworking of justice in the land, both morally and practically (cf. 5:15). This is what Israel was supposed to do, leading to blessing in society. As Proverbs 11:30 states, "The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life." It may further be noted that the NT actually employs the exact phrase of Amos 6:12 twice in reference to the sanctified lives of believers being filled with "the fruit of righteousness" through Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:11; James 3:18). In both OT and NT times, God calls his people to embody his righteousness.

Even though the nation boasted in achieving these conquests "by our own strength" (v. 13), the Lord actually gave Israel these victories (2 Kings 14:25–28). Their trust in their own strength is misplaced, which will become apparent when the Lord raises up another nation against them (Amos 6:14). "The God of hosts"—the Divine Warrior-King—will employ a foreign military force (i.e., Assyria) to "oppress" them, from their northernmost point (Lebo-hamath) to the southernmost (Brook of the Arabah). In other words, the entire land of the northern kingdom (2 Kings 14:25) will be destroyed.

### <span id="page-350-0"></span>*Response*

The oracles of woe in Amos and other OT prophets present an intimidating and ominous message of God's wrath against sin. The judgments Israel and Judah experienced in the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests, respectively, are nearly impossible to describe and quantify adequately. The temporal punishment they underwent can be read about in specific biblical passages (e.g., Jer. 39:1–10; 52:1– 30; Lam. 4:1–22), but only those who underwent it knew fully its horror.

<span id="page-350-12"></span><span id="page-350-10"></span><span id="page-350-3"></span><span id="page-350-2"></span>Nevertheless, the final punishment to which these conquests ultimately point will far exceed the terrors of the past. And notably, woes do not end with the coming of Jesus Christ. The NT announces "woes" of its own. In the Gospels, Jesus pronounces seven woes on the scribes and Pharisees of his day for their wicked hypocrisy (Matt. 23:1–36; cf. Luke 11:37–54). He pronounces woes on those who love the world and acclimate themselves to it (Luke 6:24–26). He pronounces woes on Chorazin and Bethsaida because they do not heed the signs and wonders done in them (Matt. 11:21). He pronounces woes on those through whom temptation comes (Matt. 18:7). And he pronounces woe on the one who will betray him— Judas (Mark 14:21). As the Great Prophet, Jesus carries on the prophetic role of declaring God's wrath against sin. His words warn every generation to flee from the wrath to come by fleeing to him.43

<span id="page-350-15"></span><span id="page-350-13"></span><span id="page-350-11"></span><span id="page-350-9"></span><span id="page-350-8"></span><span id="page-350-5"></span><span id="page-350-4"></span>The devastation of God's visitation in Amos 6 points to the final day of the Lord, at the end of time. The terrifying picture in verses 9–10 is far surpassed by the imagery of punishment in the book of Revelation. It is worth comparing the pictures of judgment in Revelation with the severity of the Lord's judgment in Amos, so that we might see God's hatred against our sins and those of the world (e.g., Rev. 6:12–17; 9:13–21; 14:17–20; 19:11–21). As the book of Hebrews tells us, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:31). But believers in Jesus Christ may have comfort and assurance that they have fallen into the forgiving hands of the loving Judge who received their judgment upon himself at Calvary. So let the redeemed of the Lord say, "Hallelujah! What a Savior!"

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-352-2"></span><span id="page-352-1"></span>The final section of the book (chs. 7–9) contains a series of visions spread throughout these chapters (7:1–3, 4–6, 7–9; 8:1–3; 9:1–4). Three of these visions constitute the first half of chapter 7, and each reveals a judgment of the Lord against Israel. The first two (vv. 1–3, 4–6) follow the same pattern: introduction, vision of judgment, Amos's intercession, and the Lord's relenting of the judgment revealed. The third vision (vv. 7–9) varies somewhat, with an introduction, vision of judgment, and the Lord's explanation of judgment; Amos does not intercede for Israel, nor does God relent from the judgment. Likewise the fourth vision, in 8:1–3, follows the same arrangement as the third. This suggests that there are two pairs of visions in Amos 7–8 (visions 1 and 2; visions 3 and 4). God relents from the judgments seen in the first two visions but not from the second two. (The fifth and final vision in 9:1–4 stands on its own.)

<span id="page-352-5"></span><span id="page-352-0"></span>Following the first three visions of judgment, 7:10–17 contains the only narrative section of the book. Amaziah, the priest at Bethel, confronts Amos regarding a prophecy against King Jeroboam II. The priest tells Amos to go back south from whence he has come and prophesy there. The prophet is no longer welcome in Bethel. In response to this challenge, Amos prophesies the coming fall of Amaziah's family and Amaziah's own exile and death. This passage provides the only record of response to Amos's ministry, and it is a revealing response indeed.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-353-9"></span><span id="page-353-6"></span>7:1–3 The first two visions in this chapter begin with the introductory phrase "This is what the Lord God showed me" (vv. 1, 4). The word translated "Lord" is a title used for a sovereign or ruler, and the word for "God" is his proper name (Yahweh); together, they highlight his sovereign position and rule: he is Lord Yahweh.

<span id="page-353-4"></span><span id="page-353-3"></span>The vision he shows Amos is not something happening naturally at the time but is a future event of his own making. The participle indicating that God is "forming the locusts" evokes his role as Creator, highlighted also in the doxology of 4:13 (the same Hebrew root for "to form" is present in both passages). The Lord creates the locusts (i.e., the judgment) that will soon overtake the land (cf. Deut. 28:42; Joel 1:4–20). The creation of the locusts is specifically timed to fall around April, in the Israelite growing season. This is just before the "latter growth" (Amos 7:1). The first growth, "the king's mowings," was for the monarchy, providing the royal household with grain for food and hay for livestock. This indicates that the king has gotten his due, but the peasant farmers and the rest of the land will suffer immensely because of the locust plague.

<span id="page-353-7"></span><span id="page-353-5"></span>When Amos sees the destruction the locusts bring in the vision, he cries out to the sovereign Lord, invoking his covenant name and imploring him, "Please forgive!" (v. 2). The Hebrew construction conveys earnestness, as Amos is clearly distraught over what he has seen, and his compassion for the people rises to the foreground: "How can Jacob stand? He is so small!" In a Moses-like manner (cf. Exodus 32–33), Amos intercedes on behalf of the people, asking the Lord to show them forgiveness and not bring about something that would certainly crush them.

<span id="page-353-1"></span>It is important to note that Amos's compassion appears to be toward the farmers and common people of Israel. The leadership will not initially suffer from the locust plague (although they will in the long run, being as theirs is a primarily agricultural economy). Amos laments on behalf of the peasants. In doing so, he refers to Israel as "Jacob," the patriarch to whom God reiterated his covenant (Gen. 28:13–16). It is as though the prophet appeals to the Lord's covenant love toward the forefathers as the basis for forgiveness now.

<span id="page-353-10"></span><span id="page-353-8"></span><span id="page-353-2"></span><span id="page-353-0"></span>The intercession works, and the Lord relents from this judgment, saying, "It shall not be" (Amos 7:3). He chooses not to bring about the punishment portrayed to Amos. The statement that God "relented" describes the Lord in very human terms. Such "anthropomorphisms" occur frequently in the Bible as a way of making God's infinite character understandable to finite human beings. In this case, to say that God has "relented" is to say that he will pursue a different action than the one he has announced, and will do so in response to his prophet's prayer (cf. also Ex. 32:11–14). This does not in any way impugn the doctrine of the immutability of God (Mal. 3:6). It simply communicates the manner in which God relates to his people. He warns, forgives, judges, etc., based on the response of human beings. All of these things take place under his sovereign decrees and providence, which are often a mystery to us. But it is a wonderful truth that the Lord hears the pleas of his people and compassionately responds.

<span id="page-354-7"></span><span id="page-354-6"></span><span id="page-354-4"></span><span id="page-354-3"></span>7:4–6 The second vision follows the same pattern as the first: introduction, vision of judgment, Amos's intercession, the Lord's relenting. In this case, the announced judgment is more terrifying than the first, as the Lord calls for a "judgment by fire" to devour "the great deep" and consume the "land" (lit., "portion") of Israel (v. 4). The punishment of devouring fire is a recurring theme in the book of Amos (1:4, 7, 10, 12, 14; 2:2, 5; 5:6), but here the severity of the penalty is especially strong. The word for "great deep" (*tehom*) in the OT refers to the sea in various ways: the primeval ocean (Gen. 1:2), the abyss (Job 38:16), subterranean waters (Gen. 7:11), and the sea (Ex. 15:5). Taken together with mention of "the land," the picture is of a comprehensive consumption of the created order, particularly the "portion" of Israel (cf. 2 Pet. 3:10).

<span id="page-354-12"></span><span id="page-354-5"></span><span id="page-354-2"></span><span id="page-354-1"></span><span id="page-354-0"></span>Note the Lord's prophetic statement regarding Israel's future unfaithfulness in Deuteronomy 32:22: "A fire is kindled by my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol, devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains." A similar horror leads Amos to intercede on behalf of the nation a second time. This intercession has the same earnestness as that in Amos 7:2, but here the request is not to "forgive" but to "cease." Amos appears to be so overwhelmed that he can only cry to God, "Stop, please!" The compassion of the prophet comes forth again: "How can Jacob stand? He is so small!" Mercifully, the Lord hears Amos's intercession and chooses to relent concerning this calamity: "This also shall not be" (v. 6).

<span id="page-354-10"></span><span id="page-354-9"></span><span id="page-354-8"></span>7:7–9 The third vision and response do not contain an intercession by the prophet or a relenting from the Lord, signifying the certainty of fulfillment. Amos sees the Lord "standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand" (v. 7). The exact form of the Lord's appearance goes unmentioned; the main focus of this picture is on what the Lord is holding. The word translated "plumb line" is rare, appearing only here in the OT. This has led to much discussion regarding its meaning.44 In context, however, the term indeed seems best translated as "plumb line."45 Amos sees a wall constructed with the use of a plumb line—it was initially built level and straight. The Lord now stands next to the wall with a plumb line in his hand to measure its present condition.

<span id="page-354-11"></span>This becomes clear in verse 8, where the Lord explains that he is measuring the condition of Israel—and the implication is that they have become totally misaligned. Even though he established his covenant with the nation and gave them his law, they have turned from him and become corrupt. The Lord finds that Israel is crooked and cannot be fixed. The remedy, or rather the consequence, is to destroy it. He communicates this with another allusion to the Passover (v. 8; cf.

<sup>44</sup> Cf., e.g., Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 374–373; Jeffrey J. Niehaus, "Amos," in Thomas Edward McComiskey, ed., *The Minor Prophets: An Exegetical and Expository Commentary* (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2009), 455–457; Paul, *Amos*, 233–234; Smith and Page, *Amos, Obadiah, Jonah*, 132.

"High places" were shrines on hilltops at which the people engaged in syncretistic worship, while "sanctuaries" were temples in the cities, like those in Bethel and Dan. God will reduce their religious sites to rubble (cf. Lev. 26:30–31).

<span id="page-355-2"></span><span id="page-355-0"></span>In addition, the monarchic dynasty of Jeroboam II will fall "with the sword" (cf. 2 Kings 15:8–10). This is the only reference in the book to Jeroboam II with regard to judgment, but it prepares the reader for the confrontation between Amaziah and the prophet in the immediately following verses (Amos 7:10–17).

<span id="page-355-7"></span><span id="page-355-6"></span>7:10–13 The narrative of verses 10–17 contains an account of Amos's confrontation with Amaziah the priest. Even though this account is written from the thirdperson point of view, it seems best to understand it as autobiographical. As the "priest of Bethel," Amaziah was likely the high priest there, as he apparently held a position of prominence in that religiopolitical environment. He "sent" word to King Jeroboam regarding the prophecy of Amos, revealing his political allegiance to the monarchy and his desire to bring an end to the prophet's mischief (v. 10). The message sent to the king shows that Amaziah knew the prophecy of Amos, especially regarding God's judgment against the house of Jeroboam (v. 13).

<span id="page-355-11"></span><span id="page-355-5"></span>However, Amaziah's words exhibit manipulative intent. He charges the prophet with conspiring against the king within his own kingdom ("in the midst of the house of Israel"). The word translated "conspired" has the sense of plotting against someone. In this context, it is clearly political. Additionally, by saying that the "land" cannot "bear" Amos's words, Amaziah communicates that the economic and political stability of Israel is under threat. This rabble-rousing "seer" is a menace to society.

<span id="page-355-8"></span>The priest accuses Amos of scheming against the king, quoting the prophet as saying that "Jeroboam shall die by the sword" (v. 11). Technically, the earlier prophecy only stated that "the *house* of Jeroboam" would face "the sword" (v. 9). Nothing was directed toward the king himself, but the priest alters Amos's words to suit his own political ends. And, while Amaziah's summary of the prophet's message of Israel's coming exile from the "land" more accurately reflects the truth, the conveying of this information to Jeroboam comes from the priest's own political motivations. This is seen in Amaziah's command to Amos to leave Israel (v. 12). He addresses Amos as "seer," which is not necessarily a derogatory term. Amos has seen visions (vv. 1–9), and other prophets are given this title as well (1 Sam. 9:9).

<span id="page-355-12"></span><span id="page-355-10"></span><span id="page-355-9"></span><span id="page-355-1"></span>However, by telling Amos to go back to Judah, "eat bread there," "prophesy there," and "never again prophesy at Bethel" (Amos 7:12–13), Amaziah impugns the motivations of the prophet. The priest insinuates that Amos is a careerist prophet who prophesies in order to make a living (as becomes clearer in Amos's response, in vv. 14–15). Here, Amaziah tells him to go back to his own land (Judah) to make his living. There is no mention as to whether this command comes on the authority of King Jeroboam, but the priest obviously sees himself as a protector of both "church and state" ("it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom").

<span id="page-356-6"></span>7:14–17 In Hebrew, the beginning of Amos's response is very tersely worded, leading to different understandings of the particulars of what he is saying. In terms of the general point, however, it seems best to understand Amos's words in the context of Amaziah's insinuation that he is a career prophet, i.e., a prophet for hire. He is not "a prophet" in the sense of being a prophet paid to prophesy good or ill, nor is he "a prophet's son," carrying on the family business. He is an *actual* prophet called by God.

<span id="page-356-3"></span>Amos shows this by noting his agricultural background as "a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs." This is underscored by the superscription at the beginning of the book, where he is called "a shepherd" (1:1). In short, he is not among the professional prophets of Israel or Judah. He disassociates himself further from this category by highlighting God's election of him to this ministry: the Lord "took me from following the flock" (7:15). The Lord commanded him, "Go, prophesy to my people Israel." It was not Amos's choice to engage in this prophetic endeavor. The covenant Lord chose him and has given him authority to speak. Therefore, Amos will not flee from Amaziah's opposition.

<span id="page-356-10"></span><span id="page-356-9"></span><span id="page-356-8"></span><span id="page-356-7"></span>Amos follows this self-vindication with a personal message from the Lord to Amaziah (vv. 16–17). The priest has not merely challenged Amos; he has challenged the Lord himself. By rejecting the prophet and his message (v. 16), the priest reveals his rejection of God and his authority. "Therefore" God will judge him and his household, and the judgment is extensive (v. 17). Without a husband, his wife will have to make her living as a prostitute, which is a degrading and unthinkable fall for the wife of the prominent high priest at Bethel. His sons and daughters "shall fall by the sword" (cf. v. 9), and his land will be divided up. He himself will "die in an unclean land," that is, outside the land of Israel, and the nation itself will also go into exile. Rejecting God's word always leads to destruction, no matter how prominent one's position or political connections.

<span id="page-356-2"></span><span id="page-356-0"></span>The visions in this chapter present a fearful picture of God's wrath against the wickedness of humanity. The Holy One of Israel is completely righteous in his evaluation of human beings (Gen. 18:25), and his condemnation and punishment of sinners cannot be questioned (Job 9:12: "Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'"). In the end, ". . . every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God" (Rom. 3:19). Nevertheless, two things stand out in the first two visions that should bring us encouragement and peace if our hearts are turned toward him.

<span id="page-356-11"></span><span id="page-356-4"></span><span id="page-356-1"></span>First, the Lord may relent from his judgment (Amos 7:3, 6), in perfect keeping with his character as "the Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin" (Ex. 34:6–7). It is this same mercy and grace he has now shown in the profoundest of ways by sending Jesus, the One in whom full and final forgiveness of sins is possible. Those who put their trust in him have the joy of knowing that the justice due their sins has been fully satisfied at the cross. Paul writes, "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor. 5:21).

<span id="page-357-2"></span>Second, the compassionate intercession of the Lord's prophet on behalf of the people shows that God listens to the mediatory prayers of his people. For both ministers and church members, prayer on behalf of others is an essential means of ministry. Because the Lord has chosen to accomplish his purposes through the prayers of his people, we must never believe that our intercessory prayers are offered in vain. We should instead be encouraged to pray boldly for the lost as we plead with God on behalf of those who need to turn to him.

<span id="page-357-5"></span><span id="page-357-4"></span><span id="page-357-3"></span><span id="page-357-1"></span>The confrontation between Amos and Amaziah provides encouragement as well, and even exhortation. Those who are called by God to proclaim his word are not "professional prophets." They may make their living from gospel ministry (1 Cor. 9:14), but they always do so as servants of Christ, not of themselves. Those who minister out of selfish ambition will compromise God's word (Phil. 1:15–17; 1 Tim. 6:3–5), but those who like Amos serve because they have so great a Master will stand upon his word in the face of challenge (2 Tim. 4:1–5). In a day of much compromise, let us be faithful to the word of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-358-3"></span><span id="page-358-2"></span><span id="page-358-1"></span>Amos 8 begins with the fourth vision (vv. 1–3) of this final section of the book (chs. 7–9), and it, along with the remainder of the chapter (vv. 4–14), pronounces the end of Israel. The "day of the Lord" motif (cf. 5:18–20) continues in Amos 8, and the chapter itself is bound together by the recurring word "day(s)" (vv. 3, 9, 10, 11). The day(s) is coming when the Lord will visit the nation in judgment for its unfaithfulness and will terminate its existence.

<span id="page-358-4"></span>The indictments against Israel in this chapter largely reflect the social injustices previously mentioned in the book. However, Amos is more specific in his application, such as in his charge against businessmen who hypocritically observe feasts <span id="page-359-12"></span><span id="page-359-11"></span><span id="page-359-4"></span>and Sabbaths while longing for their quick completion so that they might get back to their work of swindling the poor (vv. 4–6). However, the Lord "will turn their feasts into mourning" and bring a bitter end to life as they know it (v. 10). Consequently, the nation shall "never rise again" (v. 14). As the book nears its close, the inescapable nature of Israel's fall becomes more evident, and the mood of the text becomes more dismal. The dark destiny of the nation is imminent as the coming of the Lord draws near (9:1–6).

	- F. Judgment for Sin (8:4–14)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-359-6"></span><span id="page-359-3"></span>8:1–3 The fourth vision passage follows the same pattern as the third vision (7:7–9), thereby making them a pair (cf. comments on Amos 7). Unlike the first two visions, neither of these latter visions mentions the prophet's intercession or God's relenting from judgment (7:1–3; 4–6); the judgment revealed in these final two visions is inescapable. In 8:1 the Lord shows Amos a "basket of summer fruit." This was a basket used to harvest ripened produce, and it symbolizes that the "end" (v. 2) of the nation has come. The play on words in the Hebrew text is important to note: the words "summer fruit" (*qayits*) and "end" (*qets*) closely resemble each other, even sounding alike. The use of these terms immediately associates the image of harvest with destruction.

<span id="page-359-9"></span><span id="page-359-8"></span>The Lord describes this destruction in verses 2–3. He explains, "The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass by them"; that is, he will not pass them by when it comes to judgment. They will certainly experience it! Note how God calls them "my people," highlighting their covenantal relationship, and note that Passover imagery again occurs in this judgment context. God already stated in the third vision that he would "never again pass" them by in judgment (7:8; cf. comment on 7:7–9). He also declared earlier that he would "pass through" their midst in judgment (5:17; cf. comment on 5:16–17). This latest allusion to the Passover/exodus shows the reversal of Israel from being a blessed people to now being cursed, once again comparing the northern kingdom to God's ancient enemy, Egypt (cf. 4:10; 5:17; 7:8).

<span id="page-359-10"></span><span id="page-359-5"></span><span id="page-359-2"></span><span id="page-359-1"></span><span id="page-359-0"></span>The songs sung in worship will become "wailings in that day" (8:3). This reference to "wailing" when the day of the Lord comes (cf. 5:18–20) should be understood in the sense of "howling," or an "inarticulate, shattering scream such as is found in primitive funerary laments and in the face of sudden catastrophe."46 The irony should not be missed. The people who engage in false worship, of which singing was apparently a part, will instead cry out at the visitation of the Lord of <span id="page-360-11"></span><span id="page-360-7"></span>hosts (cf. 4:13). They will wail over the mass of dead bodies piled up and scattered everywhere (8:3). At such a traumatic sight they will howl, "Silence!" This interjection conveys a sense of awe and terror in light of the aftermath of God's wrath (cf. 6:10). The Lord has come, and there is nothing else that can be said.

<span id="page-360-18"></span><span id="page-360-13"></span><span id="page-360-10"></span><span id="page-360-8"></span><span id="page-360-4"></span>8:4–6 After the vision in verses 1–3, the remainder of the chapter functions as a unified speech, noting both the reasons for (vv. 4–6) and the outcome of (vv. 7–14) the coming destruction. Social injustice is again the indictment against Israel (cf. 3:6–8; 4:1; 5:10–12). The imperatival statement "Hear this" (cf. 3:1, 13, 4:1; 5:1) addresses those who mistreat the "poor" and "needy" (8:4), i.e., the vulnerable members of society. In particular, the guilty parties are merchants who are anxious for religious observances (e.g., the "new moon" festival and the Sabbath) to end so that they can resume increasing their wealth unfairly (vv. 5–6).47

<span id="page-360-19"></span><span id="page-360-15"></span>Their worship is superficial as they are consumed with greed on these holy days, and their greed is evidence of their idolatrous hearts (Col. 3:5). They desire to sell "grain" and "wheat," and in so doing they "make the ephah small." An ephah is a measurement of volume, and by decreasing its size, a merchant can cheat the buyer on the amount sold.

<span id="page-360-2"></span>A second expression similarly conveys the swindling of consumers: the evildoers make "the shekel great." A shekel is a measurement of weight. By increasing the size of a shekel—e.g., by writing "5 shekels" on a weight that is only 3 shekels—a seller can mislead a buyer into thinking that the shekel being used to measure weighs more than it actually does, and the buyer is charged more than the material is worth. Similarly, the merchants seek to deceive their customers by using false balances (Prov. 11:1) in order to increase their wealth. In doing so, they "buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals" (Amos 8:6; cf. also 2:6). They even propose to sell "the chaff" (lit., "the refuse") of the wheat as though it were pure grain itself. By doing so, they rob the poor while increasing their own fortune. God's laws are very specific regarding the generous and fair treatment of the poor (Deut. 10:17–26; 24:19–22), but these businessmen overtly disregard God's concern for the weak members of society.

<span id="page-360-17"></span><span id="page-360-16"></span><span id="page-360-9"></span><span id="page-360-6"></span><span id="page-360-3"></span><span id="page-360-1"></span><span id="page-360-0"></span>8:7–10 The previous indictment leads to another oath by the Lord, who swears "by the pride of Jacob" (v. 7). Scholarly debate surrounds this phrase. It could refer to the land of Israel (Ps. 47:4) as a prized possession, or to the city of Samaria (as a fortified power), as in Amos 6:8.48 It seems best, however, to interpret "the pride of Jacob" as a reference to God himself. In 4:2 the Lord swore "by his holiness," and in 6:8 he swore "by himself" (cf. comments on 4:1–3; 6:8–10). These two previous occurrences of the Lord's swearing by his own person suggest the same here. In addition, when the Lord swore by himself in 6:8, "the pride of Jacob" referred to

<span id="page-360-14"></span><span id="page-360-12"></span><span id="page-360-5"></span><sup>47</sup> The verb translated "bring . . . to an end" in verse 4 is likely a play on the word "Sabbath" that follows in verse 5.

<sup>48</sup> If the latter, it is an ironic statement: just as surely as they are proud of their might (the pride of Jacob), God will act to destroy it!

Samaria in terms of its military prowess. Now God is given this title because ultimately he has been the true pride/majesty of Jacob all along.

<span id="page-361-16"></span><span id="page-361-10"></span><span id="page-361-9"></span><span id="page-361-2"></span>The Lord swears he will "never forget" the wicked actions of the people, their persecution and oppression of the needy among them (8:4–6). This promise heightens the seriousness of God's judgment. He "will by no means clear the guilty" (Ex. 34:7); every unjust action will be brought to account (2 Cor. 5:10). The tenacity of God's pursuit of justice continues as he asks a rhetorical question in Amos 8:8: Since God will never forget, "shall not the land tremble"—natural language to describe an earthquake of judgment (cf. Nah. 1:5)—and shall not all its inhabitants "mourn" in response? Of course they will. Just as the Nile rises and falls each season in Egypt—and does so under the Lord's sovereign control (Amos 9:5)—so will God's wrath against Israel certainly flow upon the land, causing it to heave up and down when the earthquake of judgment strikes. (For other references and allusions to Egypt in the book of Amos, cf. 2:9–11; 3:1, 9; 4:10; 5:17; 7:8; 8:2; 9:5, 7.)

<span id="page-361-15"></span><span id="page-361-11"></span><span id="page-361-7"></span><span id="page-361-6"></span><span id="page-361-5"></span><span id="page-361-1"></span>"And on that day" (8:9) is another reference to the day of the Lord, and the remainder of verses 9–10 largely echoes the imagery of 5:18–20. Light will turn to darkness as the sun sets at "noon," and the earth will darken when there should instead be "broad daylight." Darkness signifies God's coming in judgment, which leads ultimately to death. In light of the Passover allusions in Amos discussed above, the ninth plague upon Egypt is a fitting illustration of the day of the Lord (Ex. 10:21–29). The sheer terror the Egyptians experienced over three days of darkness symbolized the death of their chief deity (the sun god Amun-Re) and their own descent into the abyss. Death symbolically encompassed the land of Egypt, and then the final plague came as God struck all the firstborn of Egypt (Ex. 11:1–10; 12:29–32). Notably, Egypt's judgment has now become Israel's judgment. God's own covenant people have become his enemy.

<span id="page-361-12"></span><span id="page-361-8"></span><span id="page-361-4"></span><span id="page-361-3"></span><span id="page-361-0"></span>In that day, the Lord himself will turn Israel's idolatrous religious festivals into "mourning" and their "songs" into "lamentation" (Amos 8:10). This theme of mourning replacing religious singing was introduced in verse 3 and continues in verse 10 with the imagery of "sackcloth" and "baldness." These elements were traditional expressions of grief and lament in the ancient Near East (Ezra 9:3; Isa. 22:12; Joel 1:8, 13; Jonah 3:5–9), employed as outward expressions of the misery a person felt within. The word "mourning" occurs again as Amos 8:10 concludes, likening Israel's grief to that of losing an "only son." A son represented the posterity of one's house and hope for those who would depend upon him for support and provision (e.g., wife, children, and aged parents). To lose one's only son would not only cause grief but would also signify the extinction of the entire family. The "end" of God's wrath will be like a "bitter day." As opposed to the sweetness of the Lord's covenant blessings, Israel will experience the bitterness of his covenant curses.

<span id="page-361-14"></span><span id="page-361-13"></span>8:11–14 The final section of the chapter has two parts (vv. 11–12 and vv. 13–14), each introduced by references to the day of the Lord: "Behold, the days are coming" (v. 11) and "In that day" (v. 13). Together, these verses round out the message of the nation's coming end.

<span id="page-362-6"></span><span id="page-362-3"></span>The "days are coming" when God will bring a "famine on the land" (v. 11), implying a lack of the essentials basic for survival. The Lord had previously sent famine to bring Israel to repentance, but they did not return to him (4:6). Yet this famine in 8:11 is not typical; it is not a lack of grain or water. Rather, it is the absence of "the words of the Lord" from the people's midst. The people of the land will long to hear from the Lord and will "wander" (or "stagger") "from sea to sea, and from north to east," searching for God (v. 12).

<span id="page-362-7"></span><span id="page-362-0"></span>In other words, they will look everywhere, but without success. They will "run to and fro, to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it." This statement reveals the epitome of judgment (1 Sam. 14:37; 28:6, 15–16). The Lord makes his will and his presence known through his word, namely by means of his prophets. But there will be silence from the Lord in that day, the ultimate sign of his displeasure. This famine will lead the people to search everywhere for God and his word, like searching for food and water in order to live. Yet they will find no sign of the Lord but will instead be left in despair.49

<span id="page-362-9"></span><span id="page-362-8"></span>When this famine comes, the weak members of society will not be the only ones to "faint for thirst" (Amos 8:13). "In that day," even the strongest and healthiest members of society ("lovely virgins" and "young men") will collapse under the judgment. Those who swear by idols will "fall, and never rise again" (v. 14). The judgment will be final. The oath takers in this verse may refer to the hypocritical worshipers of verses 4–6 or may simply be all who bind themselves to false deities. The "Guilt of Samaria" evidently contrasts with the "pride of Jacob" in verse 7. This contrast suggests that "Guilt" refers to the false god(s) worshiped in Samaria.

<span id="page-362-5"></span>This conclusion is further supported by the parallel oaths in verse 14: "As your god lives, O Dan," and "As the Way of Beersheba lives." The words "Guilt" and "Way" in verse 14 are parallel to "god," suggesting that all three terms refer to deities and that Israel was making oaths and promises in the name of pagan gods. The uses of "Samaria" the capital, "Dan" in the north, and "Beersheba" in the south suggest that the "whole circle of gods"50 throughout both Israel and Judah is in view. In other words, the faithlessness of the people was spread throughout the land, and the judgment would be equally comprehensive: all those who swore by foreign gods would "fall, and never rise again." Hopelessness and destruction await the covenant people who have turned away from their heavenly King and have gone after idols their own hands have made.

<span id="page-363-8"></span><span id="page-363-6"></span>religious rituals and practices but lack godly obedience reveal hearts that are far from the Lord. Jesus said, "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?" (Luke 6:46). Salvation in Christ will manifest itself in obedience to his word. If we love him (John 14:15), we will seek to be honest in work and business (Prov. 11:1); we will be gracious to and protective of the weaker members of society (James 1:27; 2:1–13); we will love one another as Christ has loved us (John 13:34). Actions reveal whether we truly worship the Lord.

The apostle Paul writes, "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil" (2 Cor. 5:10). Such a sober reality should cause a sense of dread to fill those who have "eyes to see and ears to hear." For, "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one" (Rom. 3:10–12). If left in our sin, we are without hope. But in Jesus, there is great hope! For believers, the Lord has promised, "I will forgive their iniquity, and *I will remember their sin no more*" (Jer. 31:34; Heb. 8:12; 10:17). Christ has taken away all of our evil deeds, and the Lord will never again remember them. What a comfort this is! And how deeply this message of mercy is needed in our day. Our world needs the word of Christ (Rom. 10:13–17) so that sinners might repent and believe, before the end comes. In that day, the famine of God's presence and word (Amos 8:11–12) will overwhelm the wicked as they are cast into outer darkness (Matt. 25:30–46)—far away from God and his life-giving word.

<span id="page-365-7"></span><span id="page-365-5"></span><span id="page-365-4"></span><span id="page-365-3"></span><span id="page-365-2"></span>The last chapter of Amos begins with the fifth and final vision of chapters 7–9. The format of 9:1–4 bears no resemblance to the previous four visions, however, and the passage abruptly begins, "I saw the Lord . . ." (v. 1). It does, nevertheless, convey the certainty of judgment expressed in visions three (7:7–9) and four (8:1–3). In this way, it stands as a final decisive statement that God's wrath will not be abated. The hymn in 9:5–6 presents a magisterial picture of the Lord as the one who rules over creation. This God, whom the prophet has seen in a vision, will "shake" the nation and drive it into oblivion (vv. 7–10). As a final declaration of judgment, the entire passage (vv. 1–10) provides an exclamation point for all of the oracles of doom contained in the book.

<span id="page-365-11"></span><span id="page-365-9"></span><span id="page-365-8"></span><span id="page-365-1"></span>However, this condemnation is not the last word of the book of Amos. Chapter 9 ends on a surprisingly positive and hopeful note. Apart from a brief call to seek the Lord for his favor toward the remnant of Israel (5:14–15), verses 11–15 of chapter 9 furnish the only clear statement of eschatological hope in Amos. The Lord promises to rebuild the "booth of David" (v. 11) and to "restore the fortunes" of his people (v. 14). In view of Amos's dismal message, Israel is reminded that God's favor will not ultimately be removed from them. He will be faithful to his covenant promises—his promises both to curse the people for their unfaithfulness and to redeem them from their sin. Salvation will come to the people of God.

	- H. Restoration Promised (9:11–15)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-365-0"></span>9:1–4 In this final vision, Amos sees the Lord (*'adonay*) "beside/on/against the altar," likely referring to the temple in Bethel (cf. 3:14; 4:4; 5:5, 6; 7:10, 13). Amos does not describe the Lord's appearance, but his presence is unmistakable to the prophet.

The altar was the place of worship where the worshiper offered his sacrifice in order to be accepted by God. But this vision reveals that the Lord was present for the purpose of *rejecting* the worshiper, not for accepting him. He commands the "capitals" be struck so that the "thresholds" would "shake." The capitals were the tops of the pillars serving as the main support structure for the building, while the thresholds were cut-stone bases for its doors. This shaking may refer to an earthquake, but the main idea is that from top ("capitals") to bottom ("threshold") the destruction of the temple will be comprehensive. The falling of the building upon the "heads of all the people" signifies a deathblow to the entire congregation. This imagery is reminiscent of Samson's destroying the Philistine temple in Judges 16:29–30. As God's wrath was meted out upon the wicked Philistines in the past, so now his own wicked people will face the same manner of judgment.

<span id="page-366-5"></span><span id="page-366-0"></span>The exhaustive nature of the destruction is further emphasized in Amos 9:1. The Lord will "kill with the sword" any survivors, signifying destruction by a foreign military power. If the destruction of the temple does not get them, the enemy will. Wordplays are present in the Hebrew text at the end of this verse, revealing that no one will escape the judgment. The text in effect says that the one who "flees" will not be able "to flee," nor will "the escapee" be able "to escape."

<span id="page-366-7"></span>Verses 2–4 contain five conditional statements beginning with "if." Each presents possible places where the people could hide from God, before concluding with the inevitability that he will find them in the end. In others words, they can run, but they cannot hide. The first four "if" statements involve a literary device known as *merism*, which describes opposite ends of a spectrum as a way to refer to a comprehensive whole. In this case, the merism reveals that no matter what the people do, God will punish them. They may "dig into Sheol" (i.e., the abode of the dead) or "climb up to heaven" (i.e., the abode of God), but the Lord will gather them from either place (v. 2).

<span id="page-366-9"></span><span id="page-366-8"></span><span id="page-366-6"></span>Instead of hiding in spiritual realms, the people may flee to the remote places of the earth, such as the top of Mount Carmel, or they might hide from God "at the bottom of the sea" (v. 3). Nevertheless, God will capture them from the heights of the earth or instruct "the serpent" (i.e., the beast of the deep) to "bite them" in the abyss of the oceans. In the fifth "if" statement, the Lord states that even in exile, he will "command the sword" to kill his people (v. 4). There is no escape: God's judging presence will overtake them. God declares that he will fix his "eyes upon them for evil and not for good." "Evil" in this verse refers to calamity (not morality), but the contrast with 5:14–15 should not be missed. In chapter 5, the Lord called them to "seek good, and not evil," to "hate evil, and love good." However, since they did not listen to God, he will now show them "evil" and not "good."

<span id="page-366-12"></span><span id="page-366-11"></span><span id="page-366-10"></span><span id="page-366-4"></span><span id="page-366-3"></span><span id="page-366-2"></span><span id="page-366-1"></span>9:5–6 Along with 4:14 and 5:8–9, many scholars believe that 9:5–6 was originally part of an ancient hymn, adapted by Amos for this book. This hymn exalts the Lord as creator and sovereign of the universe, beginning with the familiar picture of God as the Divine Warrior—"the Lord God of hosts." He is the commander of his heavenly armies, and when he comes in conquest, the earth "melts" (or "wavers") natural language to describe the effects of an earthquake (Nah. 1:5)—and its inhabitants "mourn" in response (Amos 1:2; 5:16; 8:8, 10). Earthquake imagery occurs in 9:5 again, as the earth rises and falls like the Nile during flood season. Note this verse's clear connection with 8:8 (cf. comment on 8:7–10).

The God who shakes the earth in judgment is also the Creator who has established "his upper chambers in the heavens" and "his vault upon the earth" (9:6), language that portrays the entire universe as God's heavenly house or palace. This imagery ultimately highlights God's sovereign control over all creation—he even summons the "waters of the sea" and "pours" them upon the earth. This refers to more than his provision of water for the land; the context of judgment suggests a catastrophe like the great flood of Genesis 6–9. The power of the God of hosts over his world is displayed not only in its formation but also in its judgment. Who is this one who does these awesome things? "The Lord is his name" (Amos 9:6; cf. 4:13; 5:8, 27).

<span id="page-367-9"></span><span id="page-367-8"></span><span id="page-367-7"></span><span id="page-367-4"></span><span id="page-367-0"></span>9:7–10 Two rhetorical questions identify Israel with the nations as a way of stating that the Israelites should not expect any special treatment. God first compares them with the "Cushites" (v. 7). Cush refers to Ethiopia and Nubia, south of Egypt and the second cataract of the Nile. Before God, Israel and Cush are alike: because of Israel's sin, they will no longer be treated as his special people. The Lord emphasizes this by revealing that Israel was not the only nation to undergo an exodus from another country: the "Philistines" came out of "Caphtor" (cf. 1:6–8), while the "Syrians" departed from "Kir."51 The Lord thus puts Israel on the same level of these nations.

<span id="page-367-3"></span><span id="page-367-2"></span>These statements perhaps include a further note of warning: since the Lord has already declared judgment on these nations—he will drive the Syrians back to Kir (1:5) and will bring punishment on the Philistines (1:6–8)—Israel can expect the same. While Israel has a special calling, such a calling does not excuse their sin or imply that they are morally superior to foreign nations.

<span id="page-367-10"></span><span id="page-367-6"></span>The interjection "Behold" (9:8) calls the hearers to a frightening reality: the "eyes of the Lord God" (cf. v. 4) gaze upon the "sinful kingdom" of Israel. The phrase "sinful kingdom" occurs only in this verse within the entire OT canon and stands out as a dramatic evaluation of a people who were called to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (Ex. 19:6). Because of their rejection of this calling, the Lord will destroy the nation from the "face of the ground" (AT). However, there is a small kernel of hope in this verse, anticipating the message of 9:11–15. God will "destroy" Israel, but he "will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob." Despite the inevitable judgment from which no one will escape (vv. 1–4), the covenant faithfulness of God will prevail. The judgment will be comprehensive, but the Lord will preserve Jacob's seed.

<span id="page-367-12"></span><span id="page-367-11"></span><span id="page-367-5"></span>The coming judgment is pictured with agricultural imagery in verse 9. Billy Smith explains:

God's shaking of Israel is compared to one shaking grain in a sieve. The function of the grain sieve was to trap what was undesirable so that it could be thrown away. Undesirable elements would include pebbles, husks, and

<span id="page-367-1"></span><sup>51</sup> See Deuteronomy 2:1–25, which describes how the Lord gave various nations the territories they inhabited.

pieces of stalks. The grain would fall into a container. Just as no pebble would fall to the ground, so thorough would be the screening process of God's judgment that none of the "sinners" (v. 10) would escape. God's judgments sift his people to remove the bad from the good.52

<span id="page-368-0"></span>Furthermore, while the particular judgment in view for Israel is the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom, this text may be speaking again of God's judgment against the sin of surrounding peoples (cf. chs. 1–2), as the phrase "among all the nations" could equally be translated "with all the nations."

<span id="page-368-9"></span><span id="page-368-8"></span><span id="page-368-6"></span>Amos 9:10 keeps the focus, however, squarely on Israel and her rebels. The occurrence of "sinners" (*khatta'*) links this verse with the reference in verse 8 to the "sinful (*khatta'*) kingdom." A "sword" is the repeated picture of judgment in this chapter (vv. 1, 4, 10), unifying verses 1–10 and highlighting the military nature of the coming punishment. The "sinners" in this verse refer to the complacent Israelites condemned throughout the book. They have rejected God's word and arrogantly boast, "Disaster shall not overtake or meet us." "Disaster" is the same word translated as "evil" in verse 4. God has declared that "evil/disaster" is coming to them, whether they believe it or not. Their confidence in themselves is drastically misplaced, and they will be overwhelmed in the day of the Lord's visitation. The words of 4:12 echo loudly at this point: "Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!"

<span id="page-368-12"></span><span id="page-368-10"></span><span id="page-368-7"></span><span id="page-368-4"></span><span id="page-368-2"></span>9:11–12 The closing passage of the book (vv. 11–15) presents a positive picture of a future day of the Lord that will follow Israel's judgment. Verses 11 and 13 begin "In that day" and "Behold, the days are coming," respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the judgment declared in 8:11 ("Behold, the days are coming") and 8:13 ("In that day"). As mentioned earlier, the "day of the Lord" motif in Scripture is employed negatively for punishment and positively for salvation, depending on the context (cf. comment on 5:18–20). So far, the day of the Lord in Amos has been largely unfavorable. But according to this final text, the day will also reveal God's mercy.

<span id="page-368-5"></span><span id="page-368-3"></span><span id="page-368-1"></span>At that undisclosed time, God promises to do several things (note the firstperson verbs in 9:11–15). He will "raise up" the fallen "booth of David" (v. 11). Even though Jerusalem has not yet been conquered by the Babylonians (587/586 BC), the Davidic monarchy is on the decline, and God has already declared his judgment against Judah (2:4–5). Thus this passage looks beyond the immediate historical context to a time of future restoration. Its messianic nature is clear: the Davidic promise will be fulfilled as the Lord raises up the "booth of David" in order to "repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old." This restoration will involve the inclusion of the Gentiles into Israel. Thus the "remnant of Edom" is representative of "all the nations" (they are parallel to one another here), and to be "called by" God's name "implies God's ownership of the unnamed nations and their submission to him (cf. Mal. 1:11)."53 This grand restoration is the act of the Lord himself ("declares the Lord who does this"; Amos 9:12).

<span id="page-368-13"></span><span id="page-368-11"></span><sup>52</sup> Smith and Page, *Amos, Obadiah, Jonah*, 162.

<span id="page-369-9"></span><span id="page-369-8"></span>That this passage refers to the inclusion of the nations in the people of God is made clear in Acts 15. At the so-called Jerusalem Council, James quotes Amos 9:11–12 to validate God's intention to save the Gentiles (Acts 15:13–17). While he quotes from the Septuagint, which is slightly different from the Hebrew, in either version the passage indicates that God has purposed to include the Gentiles among his chosen people through the work of the Messiah. James sees the gospel's spreading to the nations as (at least partial) fulfillment of the prophecy of Amos.

<span id="page-369-5"></span><span id="page-369-4"></span>9:13–15 The hope of Israel's future restoration is further described using agricultural imagery to convey an overabundance of blessings awaiting God's future people. The first two images of verse 13 picture an overlapping of seedtime and harvest. In the first image, the one who plows the ground in order to sow seed ends up overtaking "the reaper" (v. 13), who is not yet done collecting the harvest from the previous season. In ancient Israel the time between harvest and planting was about six months, so this implies that the harvest will be so great that there will not be enough time during those months to bring in all the fruit!

The second image reveals something similar: "The treader of grapes [shall overtake] him who sows the seed." The vineyards will be so fertile that the grapes will be ready to be made into wine before the sower has even finished planting the new seed. The third image displays the outcome of this abundance: the bounty of "sweet wine" will be known throughout the land as "the mountains shall drip" and "the hills shall flow" with such wine. This earthy depiction communicates a glorious reality: there will be no more curses for Israel—only the eternal blessings of God.

<span id="page-369-6"></span><span id="page-369-0"></span>The Lord himself will restore Israel's "fortunes," and her "cities" will be rebuilt (v. 14). Their peaceful existence is pictured in their being able to "plant vineyards" and "gardens" and in their drinking "their wine" and eating "their fruit." This abundance and tranquility communicates an Eden-like redemption (Genesis 2). As Stuart notes, "A basic enjoyment of the fruit of one's labor is a favorite prophetic way to express the serenity of the restoration (e.g., Isa. 37:30; 65:21–22; Jer. 29:5, 28; Ezek. 34:27; 36:10, 33; Zech. 8:12)."54

<span id="page-369-7"></span><span id="page-369-2"></span><span id="page-369-1"></span>Notably, there will be harmony between God and his people, with no risk of being exiled from the inheritance: the Lord "will plant them on their land" (Amos 9:15). This promise implies that the land of Canaan is in view, but the expression "their land" likely "indicates the ground itself."55 In other words, the focus is that each member of God's people will again have an allotment of land/ground on which to plant his vineyards and gardens. To be never again uprooted from the "land/ground" indicates a future reversal of 5:2 ("Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel; forsaken on her land, with none to raise her up"). As Stuart states, "They will no longer be sojourners but landed citizens, deeply rooted in the place God has given them."56 In this way, the exaltation of the Lord's covenantal faithfulness

### *Response*

<span id="page-370-7"></span><span id="page-370-4"></span><span id="page-370-1"></span>Partial fulfillment of the promise of restoration in Amos 9 was realized in the return of exiles from Babylon thanks to the decree of Cyrus in 538 BC. Further fulfillment came with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as David's greater Son (Acts 15:1–21). The consummation of this promised restoration will be seen in the eschatological new heavens and new earth (Isa. 65:17–25; 66:22–23; Revelation 21–22). *In that day*, God's people (both Jew and Gentile) will inherit their new "land/ground" as the new Jerusalem descends to earth (Rev. 21:1–2). The throne of God and of the Lamb (i.e., the Son of David) will be in the midst of the city, and there will be abundance and complete peace (Rev. 21:1–4; 22:1–5).

<span id="page-370-12"></span><span id="page-370-11"></span><span id="page-370-10"></span><span id="page-370-8"></span>The person and work of Jesus Christ has procured this everlasting salvation for God's people, for all who are united to Christ by faith are "Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise" (Gal. 3:29). In this way, the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ was wonderfully promised beforehand through the mouth of a sheepherding, tree-tending prophet named Amos.

<span id="page-370-3"></span>Oracle after oracle of the coming judgment prepares us for the amazing grace of the merciful and loving God declared at the end of the book. Without a clear understanding of humanity's wickedness and rebellion, we will not appreciate or sense our dire condition. Nor will we have the impetus that drives us to Christ in repentance. Hence the book of Amos condemns sinners but also promises salvation to God's remnant—all who seek him will live (5:4, 6, 14). A contemporary of Amos declared, "Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord, that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon" (Isa. 55:6–7). The Lord does not delight in the destruction of the wicked (Ezek. 18:23, 32); instead he offers mercy to all who will receive it.

<span id="page-370-6"></span><span id="page-370-5"></span><span id="page-370-2"></span><span id="page-370-0"></span>What is even more amazing is that the Lord himself has come in the person Jesus Christ to actively seek after sinners: "The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost" (Luke 19:10). The beauty of our Savior reveals the immeasurable love of the God of Israel: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). This Savior is worthy of our love, worship, and obedience all the days of our lives. Therefore, let us love Jesus Christ and live for him, looking forward to the *great and final day of the Lord*, upon which we will be forever with him in the new earth!

Indeed, the book looks ahead ultimately to the "day of the Lord" of judgment upon "all nations" (vv. 15–16). The Edomites are singled out because of their harsh treatment of Judah, their "brother" (v. 10), in aiding an invading force that ransacked Jerusalem (vv. 10–14). Edom will be repaid for their deeds and will be utterly wiped out (vv. 8–9, 18–19). Yet the book's message does not entirely concern punishment; Obadiah also prophesies salvation for Judah (vv. 17, 21), the reclaiming of her ancestral land (vv. 19–20), and the emergence of rulers over the Edomites under the kingship of the Lord (v. 21).

## <span id="page-373-10"></span><span id="page-373-5"></span>*Title*

<span id="page-373-4"></span><span id="page-373-0"></span>The book is the "vision" (*khazon*) of Obadiah (v. 1), indicating that Obadiah was the recipient of a dream or vision, as is typical of prophetic revelation (Num. 12:6–8).

## *Author*

<span id="page-373-1"></span>Apart from the name "Obadiah," which means "servant of Yah[weh]," nothing is known about the author. Some ancient and modern interpreters argue this is the same Obadiah who served King Ahab (1 Kings 18).1 There is no evidence for such an identification, however, and the probable dating of the book after the fall of Jerusalem makes this unlikely—Obadiah was a common name in both biblical texts and extrabiblical inscriptions. The interpretation of Obadiah's message does not depend on biographical details of the prophet's life.

## *Date, Occasion, and Historical Background*

The identity of the invading enemy assisted by Edom is not explicitly stated, but it is most likely the Babylonians, who sacked Jerusalem in 586 BC. There is little evidence to link Edomite activity with earlier incursions by, e.g., the Assyrians, whereas their association with Babylon is attested elsewhere (e.g., Ps. 137:7–8;

<span id="page-373-2"></span><sup>1</sup> See Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 39b; also Ehud Ben Zvi, *A Historical-Critical Study of the Book of Obadiah*, BZAW 242 (Berlin/New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1996), 17.

<span id="page-374-16"></span>Ezek. 25:12; 35:5; cf. Lam. 4:21–22). Edom initially sent envoys to a possible international coalition resisting the growing Babylonian threat, but perhaps they were dissuaded by Jeremiah's warnings (Jer. 27:1–11).

<span id="page-374-14"></span><span id="page-374-2"></span>An understanding of the origin of Edom and the history of Edomite-Israelite relations is essential for appreciating Obadiah's message. The nations of Edom and Israel were descended from Isaac's twin sons, Esau and Jacob, whose relationship as brothers was frequently tense (Gen. 27:32). While still in the womb it was prophesied that the "older shall serve the younger" (25:23), and so it played out: Jacob, the younger, received the firstborn's birthright and blessing instead of Esau (25:29–34; 27:27–29).

<span id="page-374-7"></span><span id="page-374-6"></span><span id="page-374-5"></span><span id="page-374-4"></span><span id="page-374-3"></span><span id="page-374-1"></span><span id="page-374-0"></span>Two nations emerged from the descendants of Esau and Jacob (Genesis 36; Exodus 1), and the ancient oracle that the "older will serve the younger" was confirmed by the oracles of the mysterious seer Balaam, who foretold Israel's dominance over Edom (Num. 24:18–19). Nevertheless, the Lord assigned a small mountainous territory southeast of Judah to Esau's descendants as their inheritance. When the Israelites were refused passage through Edom (Num. 20:14–21), God made it clear that Israel was not to contend with them (Deut. 2:1–8). Over time, the ancient prophecies found further fulfillment as Israel gained political and military dominance over Edom (1 Sam. 14:47; 2 Sam. 8:11–14; 1 Chron. 18:11), placing a vassal king on their throne (1 Kings 22:47). Despite the injunctions of Deuteronomy, the Israelites' treatment of Edom was harsh at times (1 Kings 11:15; 2 Chron. 25:12). Eventually, Edom revolted and crowned its own king (2 Kings 8:20; 2 Chron. 21:8–10), although Tiglath-pileser III (r. 745–727 BC) later made Edom a vassal state of Assyria.

<span id="page-374-12"></span><span id="page-374-11"></span><span id="page-374-10"></span><span id="page-374-9"></span><span id="page-374-8"></span>Given this historical backdrop, one can readily imagine the ill will harbored by the Edomites toward their "younger brothers," the Judeans. When enemy forces invaded and ransacked Jerusalem, the Edomites were only too glad to be of assistance, whether by participating in the destruction or by assisting the Babylonians (cf. comment on Obad. 10–11). Thus they profited from Judah's misfortune, and the Lord condemned them strongly for their actions (e.g., vv. 12–14).

## <span id="page-374-21"></span><span id="page-374-20"></span>*Genre and Literary Structure*

<span id="page-374-18"></span><span id="page-374-15"></span><span id="page-374-13"></span>As noted above (Introduction: Title), the book is the record of a "vision," a title also given to other Prophetic Books (e.g., Isa. 1:1; Nah. 1:1). In basic form and content Obadiah is much like other prophetic oracles, proclaiming judgment against foreign nations and salvation for the people of God (e.g., Jeremiah 46–51; Amos 1–2). Certain poetic devices such as parallelism (Obad. 3), repetition (vv. 4–5, 12–14), verb-gapping (v. 8), and wordplay (*'edom* [vv. 1, 8] vs. *'edam* [v. 13]) are utilized sporadically. On the whole, however, the book exhibits a limited use of Hebrew poetic techniques and does not seem to be a clear example of biblical poetry. It is more accurately characterized as "heightened . . . rhetoric" or "impassioned speech."2

<span id="page-374-22"></span><span id="page-374-19"></span><span id="page-374-17"></span><sup>2</sup> Daniel I. Block, *Obadiah: The Kingship Belongs to YHWH* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2013), 35–37.

<span id="page-375-5"></span><span id="page-375-4"></span>The significant overlap between Obadiah and the oracle against Edom in Jeremiah 49:7–22 (cf. Obad. 1–4 with Jer. 49:14–16; Obad. 5–6 with Jer. 49:9–10; Obad. 8 with Jer. 49:7) raises the possibility that one prophet borrowed from the other or that both prophets drew upon a third (currently unknown) source. Arguments can be made for each of these positions, but a conclusive answer is difficult to determine. On the whole, it is prudent simply to interpret the message of Obadiah on its own terms.

### *Theology of Obadiah; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

The basic theme of the book is clear: "Edom—and the nations—will be judged, and through that judgment Israel will be saved, while Yahweh is glorified for his justice and mercy."3 A number of more specific motifs can also be seen.

#### ZION THEOLOGY

<span id="page-375-3"></span>Much has been written about the "Zion theology" of the OT. "Zion," referring to a hill or ridge in Jerusalem, came to be used for the temple complex located on this "holy mount" (Ps. 87:1) and, by further extension, to the holy city of Jerusalem more broadly. "Zion theology" represents several intertwining themes: the selection of Zion/Jerusalem as the Lord's earthly abode (Pss. 78:68; 132:13) in conjunction with his victory over the nations (Psalms 46; 48; 76), and Jerusalem's association with an eternal Davidic dynasty (2 Samuel 7; Ps. 2:6).

<span id="page-375-7"></span><span id="page-375-6"></span><span id="page-375-2"></span><span id="page-375-1"></span><span id="page-375-0"></span>There is no mention of the Davidic dynasty in Obadiah; indeed, the book presents Judah as having returned to the pre-monarchical era of the judges (cf. comment on Obad. 21). Nevertheless, the exaltation of Mount Zion (vv. 16, 17, 21) over "Mount Esau" (vv. 8, 9, 19, 21; cf. vv. 3–4) is emphatic. Despite the sacrilegious treatment it has received, Zion remains central to God's redemptive plan (v. 17) and will be restored.

#### ESAU IN BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE

The troubled nature of Edomite-Israelite relations and Israel's favored status were not merely historical accidents but reflected the eternal decrees of the Lord. Indeed, the choice of Jacob over Esau is presented as conclusive proof of the Lord's sovereignty in election, taking place either before birth or before one has done anything to deserve one's fate (cf. Rom. 9:10–16; also Mal. 1:1–4).

<span id="page-375-8"></span>As profound as this biblical theme is, Obadiah's prophecy of the destruction of Edom was fulfilled in a surprising way. The Nabonidus Chronicle (1.17) attests that in 553 BC Edom fell to the Babylonians, but while this undoubtedly was a partial fulfillment of Obadiah's oracle, Edom continued for some time after that defeat. Arab peoples encroached upon Edom from the fifth to third centuries BC, causing Edom to shift westward into the Negeb of Judea. Their territory came to be known as "Idumea" and its residents as "Idumeans." Under the leadership of John Hyrcanus (134–104 BC), the Idumeans were subjugated and compelled to

receive Jewish circumcision (Josephus, *Antiquities* 13.257). As a result, over time they began to be absorbed into the Jewish nation, losing their distinct ethnic identity. In a surprising twist of God's providence, it was precisely that loss that proved to be the salvation for some: by losing their identity as "Edomites/Idumeans" and being incorporated into the covenant community, some had the opportunity to encounter Jesus the Savior and follow him during his earthly ministry (Mark 3:7–8). In a remarkable but unexpected way, Obadiah's prophecy of deliverance on Mount Zion (Obad. 17) came to pass.

### <span id="page-376-7"></span><span id="page-376-4"></span>THE DAY OF THE LORD

<span id="page-376-1"></span><span id="page-376-0"></span>It is evident that "day" (*yom*) functions as a key word in Obadiah (vv. 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), with the "day of the Lord" (v. 15) being the culmination of the theme. This rich and multifaceted concept, found throughout the OT prophets, is intimately connected with the consummation of God's redemptive plan. Willem VanGemeren says, "The goal of the Day of the Lord is the total transformation of all creation."4 He continues,

The Day of the Lord (*yôm Yahweh*) is the era in which the Lord judges, purifies a remnant for himself, avenges his name, vindicates his people, renews his creation, brings in the full deliverance, and establishes his rule on earth. . . . Thus, the Day of the Lord was a framework for interpreting history, for understanding the present under divine control, and also for projecting a final day of reckoning (the eschatological Day of the Lord). . . . The Day of the Lord is past, present, and future.5

While the "day of the Lord" is an eschatological reality, Obadiah and the other prophets indicate that intrusions of this day may occur even in the present age (cf. comment on v. 15a).

<span id="page-376-11"></span><span id="page-376-10"></span><span id="page-376-8"></span><span id="page-376-2"></span>The concept of the "day of the Lord" is further developed by NT references to the "day of Jesus Christ" (e.g., Phil. 1:6; cf. Mark 13:32; Luke 17:31; 1 Thess. 5:4; 2 Thess. 1:10; 2:3). All of history finds its ultimate "goal" (*telos*) in Christ. As the Alpha and Omega (Rev. 1:8; 21:6; 22:13), Jesus will usher in the consummation of God's plan of redemption. With respect to the book of Obadiah, it emerges that the universal judgment to take place on the "day of the Lord" (Obad. 15–16) will be carried out by Jesus Christ himself (Matt. 7:22; Luke 10:12; Acts 10:42; Rom. 2:16; 2 Tim. 1:12, 18; 4:1, 8).

## <span id="page-376-9"></span><span id="page-376-6"></span><span id="page-376-3"></span>THE KINGSHIP OF THE LORD

<span id="page-376-5"></span>Obadiah exalts the kingship (*melukah*; v. 21) of God, which refers ultimately to Christ, who was "determined to be the Son of God in power . . . by his resurrection from the dead" (Rom. 1:4 AT). Obadiah 21 indicates that kingship will belong to the Lord, even as human "saviors" (*moshiʻim*) arise to rule over Edom. All leadership roles

## *Outline*

Obadiah has proved difficult to outline since it exhibits few formal markers of literary structure (e.g., prophetic formulas), and its sections seem to overlap. The following bipartite outline is based primarily on the book's content rather than on particular literary or discourse features.

- I. The Day of Judgment for Edom (vv. 1–14)
	- A. Superscription (v. 1a) and Summons to Battle (v. 1b)
	- B. Edom's Pride despite Its Humble Circumstances (vv. 2–3)
	- C. Edom to Be Destroyed (vv. 4–9)
	- D. Edom's Crimes against Judah (vv. 10–14)

## *Section Overview*

The main focus of verses 1–14 is Edom: despite their relationship as "brothers" to the people of Judah, they failed to treat Judah with the basic respect and kindness due a family member. On the contrary, they committed serious crimes against the Judeans by supporting the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Accordingly, God pronounces judgment on them.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-379-2"></span>1a Obadiah receives a "vision," a common medium of prophetic revelation (cf. Introduction: Title). Though some maintain the oracle is addressed "to" Edom, the ESV correctly understands it as "concerning" them.

<span id="page-379-11"></span><span id="page-379-3"></span>1b In his vision the prophet hears an envoy bringing a message from the Lord, summoning the hearers to rise up for battle. Ultimately, the judgment to come upon Edom is the Lord's doing, even though the nations—including Judah—play a role in carrying it out (cf. vv. 7, 18). The nations' involvement does not imply the Lord's approval of their ways, and later judgment will be announced upon them as well (vv. 15–16).

<span id="page-379-13"></span><span id="page-379-5"></span><span id="page-379-4"></span>2–3 These verses address Edom's current circumstances and prideful attitude. Verse 2 does not refer to a future humbling but rather utilizes a Hebrew past tense verb (*netattika*) to indicate the modest status the Lord decreed for Edom (cf. ESV mg.). The Lord had assigned a particular territory to Edom as its heritage (Deut. 2:4–5), one of modest size and significance. Rather than being grateful for the Lord's provision, however, the Edomites grew proud in their mountainous dwelling and felt virtually unassailable (Obad. 3).

<span id="page-379-7"></span><span id="page-379-6"></span><span id="page-379-0"></span>4 Despite the Edomites' lofty strongholds, the Lord promises to "bring [them] down," the very thing they claim is impossible (v. 3).

<span id="page-379-12"></span><span id="page-379-10"></span><span id="page-379-9"></span><span id="page-379-8"></span><span id="page-379-1"></span>5–7 Here the prophet narrates the utter destruction of Edom as seen in his "vision" (v. 1). For this reason he speaks of it as an event already completed, even though other verses make clear the judgment is yet to come (e.g., vv. 4, 8–10, 18–19, 21). The vision depicts complete devastation: in contrast to common thieves or plunderers, who take valuable items but leave other things behind (v. 5), the Lord will cause Edom to be pillaged totally (v. 6). Surprisingly, much of the destruction comes at the hand of Edom's own "allies" (lit., "the men of your covenant"), who laid a trap for Edom even while they were "at peace" and shared meals with them (v. 7). As noted above (Introduction: Theology of Obadiah: Esau in Biblical Perspective), in

<span id="page-380-0"></span>553 BC Babylon attacked Edom, their former partners in crime. Covenant partners or allies could be called "brothers" (e.g., 1 Kings 20:32–34), and hence Babylon's treachery is poetic justice for Edom, who likewise betrayed his "brother" Judah. As Obadiah 15 remarks, one's deeds return on one's own head.

<span id="page-380-20"></span><span id="page-380-7"></span><span id="page-380-6"></span><span id="page-380-5"></span><span id="page-380-2"></span>8–9 In verses 8–9 the Lord promises the destruction of particular causes of Edomite pride, specifically their "wise men" and their "mighty men." Many scholars have posited an established Edomite wisdom tradition, attested not only in verse 8 and Jeremiah 49:7 but also in Job, which displays a number of Edomite associations (e.g., Job is identified as Idumean in the LXX expansion of Job 42:17). Thus, in addition to the physical advantages of their mountain strongholds, the Edomites had sufficient intellectual prowess and military might for survival. Nevertheless, the Lord will destroy these things, and "every man from Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter" (Obad. 9). The complete destruction of the Edomite nation is thus foretold (cf. v. 18).

<span id="page-380-21"></span><span id="page-380-12"></span><span id="page-380-11"></span><span id="page-380-8"></span>10–11 In verses 10–14 the oracle begins to give the reasons for Edom's punishment. This had previously been left unexplained in the text, though undoubtedly the original audience would have already known the basic reasons.

<span id="page-380-13"></span><span id="page-380-9"></span>The section begins by laying the charge of "violence" against Edom: it was complicit in acts of violence against Judah (v. 10a). This may have consisted of passive support of the Babylonian invasion or active participation in its brutality. The latter option seems more likely: while verse 11 faults Edom for standing "aloof" as strangers invaded Jerusalem, it goes on to say they were "like one" (*ke'akhad* ) of the Babylonians, implying a close association. In fact, the term translated "aloof" (*minneged* ) could possibly indicate the Edomite forces stood "opposite" the Babylonians, lined up in battle formation. Their deeds were inexcusable, in any event, and Edom will experience shame and destruction as a result (v. 10b).

<span id="page-380-22"></span><span id="page-380-19"></span><span id="page-380-18"></span><span id="page-380-17"></span><span id="page-380-16"></span><span id="page-380-15"></span><span id="page-380-14"></span><span id="page-380-10"></span><span id="page-380-4"></span><span id="page-380-3"></span><span id="page-380-1"></span>12–14 In verses 12–14 the oracle presents Edom with a series of prohibitions as a creative rhetorical device for enumerating further charges against Edom. First, they are not to "gloat" or "rejoice" over Judah's misfortune (vv. 12, 13b). The Lord tells his people not to rejoice over an enemy's downfall (Prov. 17:5; 24:17; cf. Job 31:29); how much more will he be displeased when Judah's foes delight in the calamities that have overtaken his own people (cf. Mic. 7:8). Second, Edom must not "enter the gate" of God's people (Obad. 13a)—undoubtedly Jerusalem—to loot and plunder (v. 13c), which would defy the many biblical prohibitions against seeking "unjust gain" by violent means (e.g., Prov. 1:10–19). These wicked deeds are dramatically compounded when committed against the holy city founded on Mount Zion, and the Lord cannot let such sacrilegious acts go unpunished. Third, the prohibitions charge Edom with acts of violence against Judeans escaping the Babylonian invaders, cutting them down as they fled (Obad. 14a) or capturing and handing them over to the Babylonians (v. 14b).

## *Response*

<span id="page-381-1"></span>This first section of Obadiah invites response on several levels. On one level, it can be taken as a warning not to commit the same crimes as Edom, such as gloating over the downfall of others, taking advantage of others' misfortune, and so on, which are forbidden by God's Word (cf. comment on vv. 12–14). Even though the Babylonian invasion and resulting exile were the climactic judgment of God on his people's persistent sin (Deut. 28:25–64), Obadiah does not directly address Judah's behavior. The book's spotlight falls squarely on Edom's sin and punishment. Any application for God's people must therefore be drawn from the text's implications.

<span id="page-381-4"></span><span id="page-381-3"></span><span id="page-381-0"></span>The post-resurrection church is "transformed Israel" (Rom. 9:6–8; Gal. 6:16); to put it another way, the people of God in the OT era were God's "church" and had been given the gospel (Heb. 4:2), just like the church of the NT era. While the progress of redemptive history has brought much light to the specifics of God's plan, and has therefore clarified some of the church's priorities (e.g., international mission) and altered some of her practices (e.g., not imposing ceremonial or civil laws distinctive to Israel upon Gentiles), there is a fundamental continuity between the two Testaments. Therefore, the church today can take instruction from Obadiah's message.

<span id="page-381-2"></span>First, while the church should expect persecution (John 15:18–20), Obadiah prepares her to be unsurprised when she is betrayed and persecuted by her "brothers"—entities seemingly closely allied with her. There have been any number of nations, institutions, civic organizations, and political parties that seemed closely aligned with the church's values only to depart from them and then to promote a moral agenda at odds with biblical Christianity. Some organizations, e.g., have swung from espousing a general Judeo-Christian ethic to undermining a biblical understanding of marriage. Similarly, many European countries had or still have an official state church possessing, at least formally, a Christian basis. Yet currently that association has little effect on political decisions made, and many such decisions run counter to the way of Christ. Obadiah prepares Christians for such realities so that they will not be surprised or capitulate to despair when such disappointments happen.

Second, as John Calvin aptly observes in the preface to his commentary on Obadiah, the book "threatens the Idumeans for the sake of administering consolation to the chosen people." The church can be assured that, however much she is made to suffer by her enemies, she will never be completely abandoned. The Lord will bring judgment on those who mistreat the church, the bride of Christ. This applies equally to those who perpetrate physical violence on God's people and those who seek to harass the church by nonviolent means.

<span id="page-382-2"></span><span id="page-382-0"></span>In verses 15–21 the prophet's focus expands from Edom's day of punishment to judgment on all nations on the "day of the Lord." On that day, the Lord will repay evildoers according to their deeds (vv. 15–16). At the same time, he will provide a means of salvation for his people (v. 17a–b). Moreover, they will experience restoration from their weak and dispersed state (vv. 17c–20), led by deliverers under the kingship of the Lord (v. 21).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-383-3"></span>15a The prophet continues to address Edom while broadening his gaze to declare, "The day of the Lord is near upon all the nations." The punishment of Edom in verses 1–14 is thus part of a larger cataclysm of judgment. This immediately raises questions concerning the oracle's fulfillment, since Edom's judgment began within roughly one generation (cf. Introduction: Theology of Obadiah: Esau in Biblical Perspective), while the day of retribution for all nations has not yet arrived. To make sense of this, one must appreciate the common phenomenon of "prophetic foreshortening" or "telescoping": in prophetic visions, future events are often compressed (or "telescoped") together and thus appear to take place simultaneously, even though in reality they may be separated in time. In Obadiah's vision, it *appears* that Edom's judgment occurs when the "day of the Lord" brings wrath upon all nations because the events have been telescoped together. A complementary perspective would be to say that Edom's "day" of judgment is a preview or intrusion of the final "day of the Lord." In either case, Edom's judgment in verses 1–14 and verses 18–19, 21 has been fulfilled, while the universal judgment of verses 15–16 still awaits fulfillment.

<span id="page-383-9"></span><span id="page-383-6"></span><span id="page-383-1"></span>In what sense would the original readers have understood the day to be "near"? The OT and NT make clear that what human beings consider "near" need not be the same for God, for whom a "thousand years" are "as a watch in the night" (Ps. 90:4; cf. 2 Pet. 3:8–9). A great deal of misguided speculation on the "end times" would be avoided by paying heed to this straightforward biblical theme. Moreover, it should also be noted that the term "near" (*qarob*) quite often expresses physical rather than temporal proximity. Obadiah 15a communicates that judgment is nigh, looming over the nations, without implying it will occur in the span of a few years or even decades. One can compare the NT's assertions that God's kingdom "is at hand" or "has drawn near" (Gk. *ēngiken*; Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 10:7; Mark 1:15). As VanGemeren says, "The Day of the Lord overshadows all human history and hence is always near."6

<span id="page-383-8"></span><span id="page-383-5"></span><span id="page-383-4"></span><span id="page-383-2"></span><span id="page-383-0"></span>15b The Lord promises to repay evildoers according to their deeds ("As you have done"). Similar expressions occur throughout the OT (e.g., 1 Kings 2:32; Jer. 50:29; Ezek. 16:43) and indicate true justice will be served; the punishment will fit the crime.

16 Edom celebrated its triumph over Judah by drinking and carousing on Mount Zion. While the victory tasted sweet at first, the aftertaste will be bitter, as the Lord promises to force all nations (including Edom) to drink the cup of his wrath to its <span id="page-384-8"></span>dregs and suffer complete destruction. For the image of the ungodly drinking the cup of God's wrath, cf. Jeremiah 25:15–29 and Revelation 14:10.

17a All nations will be judged on the day of the Lord, yet there is hope for deliverance on Mount Zion, the mountain on which the temple was built. Zion represented the heart of the covenant community as the location of God's special presence (cf. Introduction: Theology of Obadiah: Zion Theology). Salvation will be available to all who align themselves with the people of God by turning to him. Mount Zion's being "holy" (*qodesh*) implies the restoration and renewal of the house of God, which had been defiled by the Babylonians, with Edom's assistance.

<span id="page-384-12"></span><span id="page-384-11"></span><span id="page-384-10"></span>17b–20 The Lord's work of redemption begins on a restored Mount Zion (v. 17a–b) and spreads outward from there. This expansion is signaled when the prophet declares that the house of Jacob "shall possess their own possessions" (v. 17b). God's people will reclaim the land promised to the patriarchs but conquered by foreign powers. The houses of Jacob and Joseph will execute judgment upon Edom, leaving no survivors (v. 18). As several scholars have pointed out, passages such as Psalm 77:15; Ezekiel 37:16; Amos 5:6; and Zechariah 10:6 indicate that "house of Joseph" most likely represents the northern tribes, among whom the descendants of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) played a leading role. Thus the references to "house of Jacob" and "house of Joseph" in Obadiah 18 indicate a reunited people of God, as envisioned by other prophets (e.g., Ezek. 37:15–17).

<span id="page-384-14"></span><span id="page-384-13"></span><span id="page-384-9"></span><span id="page-384-7"></span>With the restoration of Zion, the reunion of the twelve tribes, and the destruction of Edom comes a "new conquest" of the Promised Land in Obadiah 19–20. The residents of the southern region of the Negeb and of the foothills of the Shephelah and centrally located Benjamin will reconquer surrounding territories. The participants in this new conquest will include even more far-flung exiles, such as those in "Sepharad" (v. 20). Much modern scholarship understands this to be in western Turkey, though ancient Jewish tradition (the Aramaic Targum; cf. the Vulgate) identified it as Spain.

<span id="page-384-15"></span><span id="page-384-6"></span><span id="page-384-5"></span><span id="page-384-4"></span><span id="page-384-3"></span><span id="page-384-2"></span><span id="page-384-1"></span><span id="page-384-0"></span>21 The prophet mentions the leaders of this new conquest—"deliverers" or "saviors" (*moshiʻim*)—who will ascend Mount Zion to "rule" (lit., "judge") Edom. The terminology of this verse, as well as the conquests of verses 19–20, intentionally evoke the book of Judges, where the Lord raised up "saviors" (Judg. 3:9, 15) to "judge" (*shpt*; Judg. 3:10; 4:4; 10:2–3; 12:7–14; 16:31) and deliver his people from enemies such as the Philistines (Judg. 3:31; 13:1, 5, etc.) and the Canaanites (Judg. 1:1, 3–5, 9–10, etc.). A point emphasized in the book of Judges, however, is that the "saviors" were only a temporary solution. The Israelites' troubles were in part because "there was no king in Israel" (Judg. 17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25), and a monarchy headed by a godly king was needed (cf. Deut. 17:14–20). A monarchy was eventually established (1 Samuel 8), but the majority of Israel's kings were an additional source of trouble for God's people. At the time of Obadiah's oracle, the Davidic heir had been deposed from the throne of Israel, and the region would be ruled by foreign-appointed governors for much of the rest of Israel's existence. Strikingly, in Obadiah's vision of Israel's restoration, the ultimate resolution for this situation is not the re-enthronement of a Davidic king but rather the reappearance of judges under the Lord's "kingship" (*melukah*).

### *Response*

<span id="page-385-6"></span><span id="page-385-5"></span>It is important that Obadiah's promised restoration be understood in a proper biblical perspective. Some Christians would interpret its prophecies of a reclaimed Promised Land (vv. 17c–20) in a literal fashion, foretelling the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The full canon of Scripture indicates, however, that the Promised Land was a theological "type" pointing to something greater than itself. As the writer of Hebrews makes clear, Abraham faithfully obeyed the God who promised him land, looking forward to a "better country, that is, a heavenly one" (Heb. 11:16), and he sought not an earthly city but a "city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God" (Heb. 11:10). In the OT itself, the Promised Land is depicted in idyllic terms free from the effects of sin and the fall, such as illness and barrenness (e.g., Deut. 7:14–15). Such promises could truly be fulfilled only in a new heaven and earth, where death will be no more (Revelation 21–22). Thus, the defeat of evil and the promises of restoration in Obadiah 17c–20 will find their complete fulfillment when the "day of the Lord" ushers in the age to come, although in his justice and mercy the Lord causes intrusions of that day into the present age.

<span id="page-385-7"></span><span id="page-385-2"></span><span id="page-385-0"></span>The certainty of judgment on all enemies who seek to harm God's people, and the promise of the church's ultimate restoration and renewal, provide an unshakable source of hope for the Christian, based not on wishful thinking but on the inerrant utterances of God. Paul mentions "hope" as one of the three cardinal virtues (1 Cor. 13:13), indicating its central importance to the Christian life. Despite the dire circumstances faced by God's people in every generation, they always possess the promises of ultimate salvation.

<span id="page-385-3"></span><span id="page-385-1"></span>This final section of Obadiah depicts God's people as agents of divine destruction (Obad. 18), as Scripture does elsewhere (e.g., Ps. 149:6–9). To avoid misunderstanding or misapplying this biblical theme, it is vital to recall how Obadiah's prophecy regarding Edom's destruction came to fulfillment (cf. Introduction: Theology of Obadiah: Esau in Biblical Perspective). The church "destroys" or "consumes" her enemies not through violence but by winning them over to Christ: as people are "baptized into Christ" (Gal. 3:26–29), there is no longer Jew, Greek, Barbarian, Scythian, or, one might add, Edomite. While this involves a loss of one's natural identity in one sense, an incomparably greater identity is found in Christ.

<span id="page-385-4"></span>John Calvin's prayer at the end of his commentary on Obadiah aptly sums up the message of the book:

Grant, Almighty God, that as we are so scattered in our pilgrimage in this world, that even a dreadful spectacle is presented to our eyes, when we see thy Church so miserably rent asunder, O grant, that being endued with the real power of thy Spirit, and gathered into one, we may so cultivate brotherly kindness among ourselves, that each may strive to help another, and at the same time keep our eyes fixed on Christ Jesus; and though hard contests may await us, may we yet be under his care and protection, and so exercise patience, that having finished our warfare, we may at last enjoy that blessed rest, which thou hast promised to us, and which is laid up for us in heaven, and which has also been purchased for us by the blood of Christ thy Son, one Lord. Amen.

# JONAH

*Jay Sklar*

## INTRODUCTION TO JONAH

## *Overview*

<span id="page-389-4"></span><span id="page-389-3"></span><span id="page-389-2"></span><span id="page-389-1"></span>The theme of the book of Jonah is the Lord as a God of worldwide grace, mercy, and love who desires to save all people. Thus he rescues the sailors in chapter 1, Jonah in chapter 2, and the Ninevites in chapter 3. In sharp contrast is Jonah, who delights to experience the Lord's mercy and salvation for himself (ch. 2) but does not want to share it with evil Gentiles (ch. 4). The book closes with the Lord using a question to reveal Jonah's misunderstanding of the Lord's mercy and love. He asks, in effect, "Jonah, is it not right for me to show these things to all people, even those you do not think deserve it?" No answer is given; the question is left for the reader to answer.

## *Title, Author, and Date of Writing*

The book is named after its main human character, Jonah, a prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel. The book is one of "the Twelve," the traditional Jewish title for the Minor Prophets.

We are not told who wrote the book or when it was written. The presence of details only Jonah would have known—such as his prayer in chapter 2—could imply it was written shortly after the events it narrates by Jonah himself (after his repentance?), or by a contemporary prophet who knew him. It could also have been written at a later point by an inspired author working with sources describing the events, or by a prophet to whom they were revealed. That the "twelve prophets" are named in *Sirach* 49:10 (written shortly after 200 BC) means Jonah was written before that time, leaving a very broad range of possible dates, from any time during Jonah's life to many centuries later (therefore, c. 750–250 BC). There is simply not enough evidence to narrow the date further.1

## *Date of the Book's Events; Occasion*

<span id="page-389-0"></span>A much narrower range of dates may be proposed for the book's *events*. We know that Jonah lived during the reign of Jeroboam II (cf. 2 Kings 14:25), who ruled for most

<sup>1</sup> It has sometimes been argued that the book's language, customs, or (supposed) historical inaccuracies favor a date of writing during or after the exile of 586 BC. For a critical examination of these arguments, see T. Desmond Alexander, "Jonah," in *Obadiah, Jonah, Micah* (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 1988), 52–61; Douglas Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah* (Waco, TX: Word, 1987), 432–433.

of the first half of the eighth century BC.2 But we do not know how Jonah's life and ministry overlapped with Jeroboam's rule. If he was alive before Jeroboam's reign and these events took place early in his life, they may have occurred in the second half of the ninth century BC. If he was alive after Jeroboam's reign and these events took place later in his life, they may have occurred in the second half of the eighth century BC. They also could have happened anytime between these two extremes, leaving us with a range of 843 to 705 BC in which the events of this book could have taken place.3

Nineveh was a chief city (and later capital) of Assyria, whose power and significance grew considerably from 883 to 826 BC, went through a period of decline for about seventy years, and then began to grow again when Tiglath-pileser III came to the throne in 745/744 BC. It was under this renewed Assyria that Israel was defeated and carried off into exile in 722 BC. As for Nineveh in particular, "Its great moments took place in the early first millennium, beginning with Shalmaneser I and Assurnasirpal II (9th century)," with its full glory being reached during the reign of Sennacherib (704–681).4 Thus during Jonah's life Nineveh was a place of great enemy power, filled with those who worshiped gods other than Yahweh. Significantly, it was also associated with great wickedness (cf. comment on 1:1–2), which may help explain Jonah's attitude toward it.

<span id="page-390-2"></span>Why was Jonah written? The book itself does not explicitly provide a reason, but its content seems to emphasize at least three reasons for its composition (see table 6.1).

<span id="page-390-0"></span>TABLE 6.1: Three Reasons Why Jonah Was Written

<span id="page-390-3"></span>These three reasons are closely connected. Those who are spiritually proud are the quickest to forget their own need of God's mercy and compassion, and therefore

3 See Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 446.

<sup>2</sup> Jeroboam II's exact dates are debated; Edwin Thiele advocates for 782/781–753/752 BC (with a co-regency from 793/792 to 782). See Edwin Richard Thiele, *The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951), 69–70.

<sup>4</sup> Jack M. Sasson, *Jonah: A New Translation with Introduction, Commentary, and Interpretation*, AB (New York: Doubleday, 1990), 71.

the slowest to have mercy and compassion for others. Such pride leads to patterns of sin that demand the Lord's discipline and justice. The book of Jonah thus becomes a somber warning against any type of spiritual pride and a clear call to keep the Lord's mercy and love so strongly in front of our eyes that we remain humble toward him and become passionate about sharing such wonderful mercy and love with others.

## *Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-391-4"></span>The opening verses of Jonah are very similar to the opening verses of other prophetic works (cf. comment on 1:1–2). What follows these verses, however, is not a series of oracles—as is usually the case in prophetic literature—but a story. This makes Jonah a prophetic narrative. As discussed below, it is similar to 1 Kings 17– 19 (cf. Interpretive Challenges).

<span id="page-391-9"></span><span id="page-391-8"></span><span id="page-391-5"></span><span id="page-391-0"></span>The story itself is brilliantly told. The narrator uses clever contrasts of characters (cf. Response sections on Jonah 1:1–16; 1:17–2:10), plays on words (cf. comments on 4:1; 4:6), and questions left hanging for the listener to answer (cf. comments on 4:4; 4:10–11). The result is the Israelite listeners' being led slowly and surely to a view of Jonah—the one with whom they would have identified most in the story—as a man who is dead wrong. Once the listeners are there, it is only a short step to ask, "What about us?"

## *Theology of Jonah; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

The following survey will complement and expand some of the observations already made.

#### THE LORD IS SOVEREIGN IN HIS POWER

<span id="page-391-6"></span><span id="page-391-2"></span>At several points in this book, the Lord demonstrates his sovereign power by commanding nature to do his bidding (1:4, 17; 2:10; 4:6–8). Jonah declares the Lord to be maker of all things (1:9), which from a biblical perspective means he is their King (Ps. 95:3, 5) and thus the One before whom all people should bow in humble worship and praise (Jonah 1:16; 3:5–9; cf. Pss. 24:1–2; 68:32–35; 89:9–12; 96:1–13; 97:1).

<span id="page-391-12"></span><span id="page-391-10"></span><span id="page-391-3"></span><span id="page-391-1"></span>In the NT, Jesus demonstrates the same sovereign power over nature: he stills storms (Mark 4:39); he commands plants, and they obey (Matt. 21:19). What is more, his power extends to healing the sick (Luke 4:40), raising the dead (Mark 5:22–43; John 11:43–44), and delivering people from the forces of spiritual evil (Luke 4:41). Such power makes it clear: here is the King of God's kingdom! The Lord has given to Jesus all authority in heaven and earth, and therefore everyone in heaven and earth should bow before him in humble worship and praise (Matt. 28:18–20; Phil. 2:9–11).

#### <span id="page-391-11"></span>THE LORD IS SAVIOR

<span id="page-391-7"></span>Because of his sovereign power, the Lord is able to rescue and save. Salvation really does belong to the Lord (Jonah 2:9), and this truth is central to Jonah: "It is true for <span id="page-392-6"></span><span id="page-392-3"></span>the sailors in chapter 1, for Jonah in chapter 2, and for the Ninevites in chapter 3, and it is the objective of God's questioning of Jonah in chapter 4."5 The implication is that the Lord is the one to whom all people should look for salvation.

<span id="page-392-4"></span>This lesson extends far beyond Jonah. The Lord is commonly described in the Bible as the one who delivers and saves, be it from the trials we experience in this life (the focus of many OT texts) or from the ultimate trial of eternal death (the focus in the NT). (Cf. comment on 2:7–9.) He is a saving God and thus the one we should cry out to for deliverance and salvation. Today, this means crying out to Jesus, who is not simply the King of God's kingdom but the one God has sent "to be the Savior of the world" (1 John 4:14). And Jesus delights to answer our cries; he is the King of love and mercy who has given his life for his sinful, rebellious subjects in order that we might be saved (1 Pet. 3:18).

#### <span id="page-392-15"></span><span id="page-392-14"></span>ALL PEOPLE NEED THE SAVIOR AND ARE CAPABLE OF TURNING TO HIM

<span id="page-392-2"></span>This book emphasizes that all people are sinful and thus equal in terms of their need of God's saving mercy. The Lord wants his people to remember how desperately they need his mercy so that they might be humbled, rely on him in the appropriate way, and show his mercy to others (cf. Response section on Jonah 1:17–2:10). Jesus returned to this same lesson in his parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector (Luke 18:9–14), and his warning stands to this day: "Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted" (v. 14).

<span id="page-392-12"></span><span id="page-392-11"></span><span id="page-392-1"></span>The book also tells two stories of two different groups of pagans who repent and turn to the Lord to receive his mercy: the sailors (Jonah 1) and the Ninevites (ch. 3). Such stories are rare in the OT. They should not only set a model for Israelite listeners to follow ("You, too, be people of repentance!"); but the stories should also give the Israelites a vision for what can happen among their pagan neighbors and thus encourage them in their mission: to be a kingdom of priests in and for the world (Ex. 19:6), priests who "pray for, love, minister to, and witness to the nations."6

<span id="page-392-10"></span><span id="page-392-9"></span><span id="page-392-0"></span>Jesus understood this mission. This is why he showed God's mercy and love not only to Israelites but also to the nations (Matt. 8:5–13; 15:22–28; John 4:5–35). It is why his final words to his followers are to "make disciples of all nations" by taking the good news of his kingdom "to the end of the earth" (Matt 28:19; Acts 1:8). This leads to the last point.

<span id="page-392-5"></span>When Jonah experiences the Lord's mercy and salvation, he praises the Lord (Jonah 1:17–2:10). When the Ninevites experience the same (3:5–10), he is furious with the Lord (4:1–3). How can this be?

<span id="page-392-7"></span>Jonah's root problem is that he somehow views himself as deserving of God's mercy but others as deserving of his justice. He has forgotten his own sinfulness and deep need of mercy. He has also misunderstood the heart of God. The Lord

He "desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4; cf. 2 Pet. 3:9). As soon as we divide the world into those who are deserving of this salvation and those who are not, we have forgotten God's real desire to show his mercy to all; in fact, we have denied it.

<span id="page-393-5"></span><span id="page-393-4"></span>In Luke 15, Jesus is speaking to religious leaders who are upset that he would actually show love to "tax collectors and sinners" (v. 1). He tells them a series of parables about things that were lost—a sheep, a coin, a son—and the joy people felt when they were found. The point of each parable is the same: heaven rejoices when lost sinners repent and are found (vv. 7, 10). The Lord welcomes them back like a father welcoming back a long-lost child (vv. 20–24).

<span id="page-393-7"></span><span id="page-393-6"></span>If we remember the tremendous mercy and love the Lord has shown to us in Jesus—even though we do not deserve it—we will be filled with mercy and love for others and a desire that they experience the same. But if we forget, it will not be long before we find our hearts to be the same as Jonah's, just as lacking in compassion and love.

### *Preaching from Jonah*

#### THE MIRACULOUS EVENTS

<span id="page-393-1"></span>When preaching from Jonah, it will be important to recognize that, for many audiences, some of the miracles in the book will seem hard to believe. The preacher may explain the two basic approaches to this issue in Christian and Jewish communities. (1) Throughout history, it has been common to treat these miracles as true, just like scores of other miracle accounts in the Bible. The book is therefore read as a historical account, recorded to teach us important points. (2) More recently, an increasing number have viewed the miracles as fiction; the book is therefore treated as a parable—a story that is not historical but still is teaching valuable lessons. Importantly, the preacher may note that, in either case, the story of Jonah is included in the Bible to teach us something, and this means that people in both camps can listen to it with ears to learn.

<span id="page-393-3"></span><span id="page-393-2"></span>STAYING FOCUSED ON GOD'S CHARACTER AND HOW IT IS REVEALED IN JESUS If we focus a sermon simply on the human characters in this story, moralism often results: "Be like the sailors! Don't be like Jonah! Be like the repentant Ninevites!" While it is true that certain people in the book model good behavior while others model the opposite, what must not be missed is that each chapter uses the actions or words of the characters to make some aspect of *the Lord's character* clear. In chapter 1, the sailors act as they do because they realize *the Lord's sovereign power*. In chapter 2, Jonah praises the Lord for being *a God who saves*. In chapter 3, the Ninevites' repentance provides the Lord a way to show that he is *a God who relents from sending judgment to those who repent*. And in chapter 4, Jonah's words make clear that the Lord is *a God who is merciful and forgiving*, while Jonah's actions provide the Lord a chance to emphasize he is *a God whose love is worldwide.* Thus sermons from this book should

keep coming back to the Lord's character. And once we are there, we will naturally want to show how Jesus shows this same character, and to consider how we should respond in light of who he is (cf. Response sections for examples).

Real change does not happen by giving people a list of moralistic rules; it happens as we come face-to-face with the Redeemer and are transformed by his Spirit. Let us do all we can to bring our listeners into his presence.

### *Interpretive Challenges*

#### A REAL STORY OR SIMPLY A PARABLE?

Throughout the centuries, the most common approach to Jonah was to read it as a historical account. In more recent times, however, many have read Jonah as a parable: a story that is not true but is meant to convey a certain point. As noted above, this second approach would not take away from the lessons the book is teaching. Jesus often taught in parables and expected his hearers to learn and act on the truth the parables conveyed. But is "parable" the best approach to Jonah?

Those in favor of this approach tend to argue that: (1) Jonah has an improbable number of miracles. (2) The literary artistry of Jonah, with all its hyperbole, irony, and wordplay, is more suggestive of parable than historical account. (3) Various inaccuracies in the book suggest a distance from historical realities.7 By way of response, it may be noted: (1) It is not clear what standard is being used when the number of miracles is labeled "improbable"; that this approach is much more common in recent times than in ancient ones suggests it is connected to a modern scientific worldview, with its skepticism toward the miraculous. The biblical worldview has no such skepticism, which should at least give us pause before using the word "improbable" too quickly. (2) It would be accurate to say these types of literary artistry (hyperbole, irony, wordplay) may be more common in parable than in historical writing, but they are not exclusive to parable; history writers may and do make use of these same literary techniques (and more besides!) as they select and arrange their material.8 (3) Supposed instances of historical errors (such as the "king" of Nineveh at 3:6) are considered in the commentary that follows and found to be unpersuasive.

<span id="page-394-3"></span><span id="page-394-2"></span><span id="page-394-1"></span><span id="page-394-0"></span>Does anything speak in favor of reading this work as actual history? It has been noted that, from a literary perspective, Jonah is similar to the account in 1 Kings 17–19, concerning the prophet Elijah.9 Like Jonah, these chapters are also about a prophet, are full of miracles (even miracles involving animals; 1 Kings 17:6), and recount at least some events outside Israel (1 Kings 17:8–24). Significantly, these chapters are found right in the middle of historical narrative. The reader is to understand that these events, some of which—such as a person rising from the dead or fire coming down from heaven—are just as miraculous as anything in Jonah, actually happened. This opens up the possibility of reading Jonah in the same way.

<sup>7</sup> Cf., e.g., Leslie C. Allen, *The Books of Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah*, NICOT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1976), 176–177, 186.

<sup>8</sup> See discussion in V. Philips Long, *The Art of Biblical History* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1994), 58–76, especially 58–63.

<sup>9</sup> Alexander, "Jonah," 76.

The above observations neither disprove a parabolic approach nor prove a historical approach (and again, the book's lessons remain no matter which approach is taken). In the absence of strong arguments to the contrary, I find myself hesitant to take an approach different from that of the majority of readers since ancient times, especially considering that their worldview was probably more in keeping with the writer of Jonah's than is my own.

## JONAH 1:1–16

<span id="page-396-0"></span>1 Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, **<sup>2</sup>** "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil*<sup>1</sup>* has come up before me." **3**But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.

**<sup>4</sup>**But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. **5**Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. **<sup>6</sup>** So the captain came and said to him, "What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call out to your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish."

**<sup>7</sup>**And they said to one another, "Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us." So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. **8**Then they said to him, "Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?" **9**And he said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land." **10**Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, "What is this that you have done!" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.

**<sup>11</sup>**Then they said to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?" For the sea grew more and more tempestuous. **12**He said to them, "Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you." **13**Nevertheless, the men rowed hard*<sup>2</sup>* to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. **14**Therefore they called out to the Lord, "O Lord, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not on us innocent blood, for you, O Lord, have done as it pleased you." **<sup>15</sup>** So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. **16**Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-397-0"></span>The opening chapter of Jonah is a series of unexpected shocks. The first occurs when Jonah, the Israelite prophet, rebels against the Lord's command to go to Nineveh by fleeing from his presence and heading toward faraway Tarshish (vv. 1–3). This type of rebellion is something recorded of no other prophet of the Lord. The shocks continue as the story unfolds: the Israelite prophet continues in his rebellious path, going further and further away from the Lord, while pagan sailors—who start the chapter not even knowing the Lord—move closer and closer toward him (vv. 4–16). These contrasts would have been especially surprising to an Israelite audience, leading them to an unexpected conclusion: a negative regard for Jonah, the Israelite prophet who claims to fear the Lord but is clearly rebelling against him (vv. 9–10); and a positive view of the pagan sailors, who come to fear the Lord greatly and worship him (v. 16).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-398-3"></span>1:1–2 In the Minor Prophets, it is common to begin a book with some form of the phrase "the word of the Lord came" to the prophet, followed by a bit more detail about the prophet himself (cf. Hos. 1:1; Mic. 1:1; Joel 1:1; Zeph. 1:1; Hag. 1:1; Zech. 1:1). This helps orient the reader to the general historical period or geographical region in which the prophet worked.

<span id="page-398-7"></span><span id="page-398-1"></span><span id="page-398-0"></span>In this case, the prophet is "Jonah, the son of Amittai." Although nothing is known of Amittai, we know that Jonah was from Gath-hepher, a town in northcentral Israel, west of the Sea of Galilee (2 Kings 14:25). We also know that he prophesied during the days of Jeroboam II (2 Kings 14:23–29), who ruled the northern kingdom of Israel in the first half of the eighth century BC. Whether the events of the book of Jonah took place before, during, or after Jeroboam's reign is impossible to tell (cf. Introduction: Date of the Book's Events; Occasion). For the narrator, it is enough that we know that Jonah is one of the Lord's prophets, at work in the northern kingdom, who is now receiving a word from the Lord.

<span id="page-398-6"></span><span id="page-398-5"></span>The Lord gives Jonah two basic instructions. First, he is to "go to Nineveh" (Jonah 1:2), which was located "on the left bank of the Tigris opposite present-day Mosul in Iraq."12 Nineveh is described as a "great city," which certainly refers to its size (3:3; 4:11) and probably also to its importance. It served as the capital of Assyria for much of the seventh century BC but was great in size and importance from the ninth century (before Jonah's time) until its destruction in 612 (after Jonah's time). See Introduction: Date of the Book's Events; Occasion. Significantly, other prophets at work either during or shortly after the time of Jonah proclaim the Lord's justice against Assyria in general (Isa. 10:5–19; Nah. 3:18) and Nineveh

<span id="page-398-2"></span><sup>11</sup> This title is adapted from Uriel Simon, *Jonah: The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation/ Commentary* (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1999), 7.

<sup>12</sup> Allen, *Jonah*, 203n3.

<span id="page-399-9"></span><span id="page-399-8"></span>in particular (Nah. 1:1; Zeph. 2:13), condemning their evil deeds and cruelty (Isa. 10:7–11; Nah. 3:1–4, 19).

<span id="page-399-2"></span>It would therefore be no surprise for Israelites to hear the Lord's second instruction to Jonah: "Call out against it, for their evil13 has come up before me" (Jonah 1:2), that is, their evil deeds have come to God's notice and call forth his response. Israelites hearing this description may well have thought of Sodom and Gomorrah, whose deeds were so evil that they attracted the Lord's special attention as well—and ultimately, his justice (Gen. 18:20–21; 19:1–25). This comparison will be underscored in Jonah 3:4.

<span id="page-399-6"></span><span id="page-399-3"></span><span id="page-399-0"></span>1:3 Jonah rebels completely against the Lord's command, which this verse highlights in four ways. First, the narrator begins verses 2 and 3 with forms of the same Hebrew word in order to contrast the Lord's command with Jonah's disobedient action:

```
Arise (qum), go to Nineveh (v. 2)
```
But Jonah rose (*yaqam*) *to flee to Tarshish* (v. 3)

Second, the narrator repeats three different times that Jonah is headed to Tarshish—and thus not to Nineveh! While the exact location of Tarshish is debated, it is usually understood to be somewhere to the west,14 while Nineveh was to the east. Jonah is not simply going to a different city—he is headed in the opposite direction.

<span id="page-399-4"></span>Third, the narrator says two different times that Jonah "goes down," first to Joppa (modern-day Jaffa), then into the ship. (A third time will come in v. 5, when he "goes down" below deck.) This repetition seems more than coincidental, especially in light of the fact that Jonah is fleeing from before the Lord, seated in the heavens, before whom things "come up" (v. 2). Jonah's "going down" thus highlights his movement away from the Lord.

<span id="page-399-1"></span>Fourth, the narrator begins and ends the verse by noting that Jonah is fleeing "from the presence of the Lord." This is the opposite of the job of a prophet, who was to stand in the presence of the Lord, the heavenly King, and receive messages from him to pass on to others (1 Kings 17:1; 18:15). This suggests that Jonah is not simply fleeing a geographical location (such as the Lord's presence in the temple at Jerusalem); he is fleeing his responsibilities as a messenger of the heavenly King. He no longer wants to be the Lord's prophet.

<span id="page-399-7"></span>We do not yet know Jonah's reason for fleeing; we will have to wait until Jonah 4:2 for an explanation. At this point, the narrator simply underscores the depth of Jonah's disobedience. The Israelite prophet is acting like the pagans to whom he refuses to preach.

<sup>13</sup> The Hebrew for "evil" (*raʻah*) can also mean "disaster" (cf. ESV mg.). This is because there is a close connection in biblical thought between sin and its punishment; terms for the one can therefore be used to describe the other. In this context, "evil" is the sense; in 1:7–8, "disaster" is the sense.

<span id="page-399-5"></span><sup>14</sup> "Various places have been suggested [for its location]: Tartessos in Spain, Tyrseni (Etruscans) in Italy, Carthage in North Africa, and Tarsus in Cilicia—to name just four" (W. S. Lasor, "Tarshish," in *International Standard Bible Encyclopedia*, ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, 4 vols. [Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1995] 4:734).

<span id="page-400-7"></span><span id="page-400-6"></span><span id="page-400-5"></span><span id="page-400-3"></span>1:4–6 Our attention is immediately switched to the Lord, who causes a storm so powerful that the ship is on the verge of breaking apart (v. 4). It is immediately clear that there is nowhere Jonah can hide from God's presence (cf. Pss. 33:13; 139:7–10; Amos 9:1–3). It is also clear that the Lord is the sovereign ruler of this world, the King whom nature itself obeys, because he is its maker (Job 38:12–38). We will encounter this theme several more times before the story is done (Jonah 1:17; 2:10; 4:6, 8).

<span id="page-400-13"></span><span id="page-400-8"></span><span id="page-400-2"></span>The sailors respond to the storm with understandable fear (1:5a). Death is just one wave away, and so they do everything they can to survive. On the one hand, they appeal to the heavens for help, each one crying out to his god. But their cries are useless; this is the Lord's storm, and appeals made to any other "god" will have no effect. So the sailors also begin hurling their cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. The lighter the ship, the higher it sits in the water, and the more difficult it is for waves to sink it. But it does little good; the storm is too great and the ship continues to edge closer to total destruction.

<span id="page-400-9"></span>Amid this chaos, the narrator suddenly switches our attention to Jonah (v. 5b). While the sailors are above deck, crying out and working feverishly, Jonah is below deck, "fast asleep." It is the first of many ironic contrasts highlighted between Jonah and the sailors. In this case, it is the pagan sailors who are praying while the Israelite prophet slumbers.

<span id="page-400-4"></span>The contrast is emphasized when the captain finds Jonah below deck (v. 6). He begins with a rebuke: "What do you mean, you sleeper?"—the sense being, "What do you think you're doing, being in a deep sleep at a time like this!" (cf. "What right have you . . . ?" Ps. 50:16). And then, in words dripping with irony, the captain commands: "Arise, call out to your god!" The pagan sailor is the one who has to tell the Israelite prophet to pray!

But the captain is not intending to be ironic; he is trying to avoid death. From his perspective, none of the other gods have cared about the sailors' situation; maybe Jonah's "god" will. The captain knows the gods cannot be forced to act ("*Perhaps* the god will give a thought to us"),15 but he wants to make sure they have at least asked the right one to do so. He "hopes to locate at least one god who has power to say to the storm 'Peace, be still!'"16 This is why he commands Jonah to pray.

But Jonah remains silent, refusing to pray, and so the narrator returns our attention to the frantic sailors.

<span id="page-400-12"></span><span id="page-400-10"></span><span id="page-400-1"></span>1:7–9 The sailors "are sure that among their number is a guilty individual who, like a magnet, has attracted to the ship this demonstration of divine anger."17 In order to discern the guilty party, they "cast lots" (v. 7), a commonly accepted way in the ancient world to seek divine direction (cf. 1 Sam. 10:2–21; 14:40–42). As a result, the sailors finally learn what we have known all along: Jonah is the one responsible; he is the magnet attracting this divine disaster.18

<span id="page-400-0"></span><sup>15</sup> See also 3:9; cf. Exodus 32:30; Amos 5:15 (Simon, *Jonah*, 10).

<span id="page-400-14"></span><sup>16</sup> Elizabeth Achtemeier, *Minor Prophets I* (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1996), 263, citing Mark 4:39.

<sup>17</sup> Allen, *Jonah*, 208.

<span id="page-400-11"></span><sup>18</sup> For "evil" with the sense of "disaster" in verses 7–8, cf. note 40.

<span id="page-401-7"></span>The sailors therefore fire a barrage of questions at Jonah (v. 8). They first give him a chance to confirm that the lots were correct ("Tell us on whose account . . ."), and then they seek any information possible that will help them know what to do. For example, asking about his "occupation" might be a way to see if his work was connected to a specific deity (many occupations had a "patron deity," much like "patron saints" today).19 Similarly, knowing Jonah's land and people would give clues as to which deity might be angry with him.

<span id="page-401-8"></span><span id="page-401-1"></span><span id="page-401-0"></span>Jonah does not answer all their questions, but he does tell them the most important information (v. 9)—in terms of nationality, he identifies himself as a "Hebrew," a common way of distinguishing the Israelites from other nations (Gen. 43:32; Ex. 2:11; 1 Sam. 4:6). In terms of his god, he identifies him clearly as "the Lord," emphasizing this by putting the Lord's name first in the sentence in Hebrew: "And the Lord, the God of heaven, I fear, who made the sea and the dry land."

<span id="page-401-5"></span>Each part of this response is significant. First, by using "the Lord"—Hebrew *Yahweh*—Jonah is naming the exact deity in view.20 Second, by describing him as "God of heaven," he makes clear that the Lord is the supreme deity, the one ruling over all (cf. 2 Chron. 20:6; Ps. 115:3). Third, he emphasizes the Lord's power by describing him as the one "who made the sea and the dry land," who is thus sovereign over them; "the Creator is the master of His creation."21 In short, it is the Lord who is causing this storm in the sea that he himself created, and he is the sailors' only hope of making it back to the dry land that he himself made.

<span id="page-401-4"></span><span id="page-401-3"></span>But there is a final aspect of Jonah's response that is significant: his claim that he "fears" the Lord. On the one hand, this would be a natural way for him to describe himself as a worshiper of the Lord (cf. Josh. 22:25, where the same Hb. word is translated "worship"). At the same time, true "fear of the Lord" leads to reverent obedience to the Lord's commands (Deut. 5:29; 13:4; Josh. 24:14; etc.). This is exactly the opposite of what Jonah is doing! His claim to fear the Lord thus rings hollow.22 It does not matter what he claims to believe if his behavior tells a different story.

<span id="page-401-11"></span><span id="page-401-10"></span>1:10–12 The sailors are once again presented as a contrast. The narrator uses the same word for "fear" to describe their response, which could be woodenly translated, "Then the men feared with a great fear" (v. 10). Jonah claimed to "fear" the Lord and yet ran away from him in disobedient rebellion (v. 9); these men learn of the Lord and respond with a very great and real "fear." Turning to Jonah, they cry out, "What is this that you have done!" At some point, Jonah "had told them" he was "fleeing from the presence of the Lord" (v. 10b),23 and the men now make clear by their words their belief that this storm is nothing less than a punishment

for Jonah's sin and rebellion. In yet another ironic twist, it is the pagan sailors who rebuke the Israelite prophet.

<span id="page-402-2"></span>But the sailors do not know how to appease the Lord, so they ask Jonah for advice (v. 11a). For all they know, Jonah's god would be happy with various forms of punishment other than death. But whatever they needed to do, they needed to do it quickly! The storm was only growing worse (v. 11b).

<span id="page-402-4"></span><span id="page-402-3"></span>Jonah responds by admitting that his presence is the reason for the storm and by telling the sailors to throw him overboard—to certain death—in order to escape the danger (v. 12). Commentators sometimes debate whether this demonstrates selflessness ("I'll die so you don't have to!") or stubbornness ("I'd rather die than repent!") on Jonah's part. The second of these would be much more in keeping with what we know of Jonah so far (and what he demonstrates later on as well; 4:3, 8, 9), but perhaps the debate is centered on the wrong thing. The narrator immediately switches our attention to the sailors and focuses on their behavior for the rest of this part of the story (1:13–16). In short, it is their response to Jonah's words that matters, and in their response the contrast between them and Jonah comes to completion.

<span id="page-402-10"></span><span id="page-402-7"></span><span id="page-402-5"></span>1:13–16 The sailors' next act is shocking. Instead of throwing Jonah overboard, "the men rowed hard to get back to dry land" (v. 13a). Why? We cannot help but assume that they are motivated by their fear of the Lord. The last thing they want to do is to make Jonah's god any angrier, and thus they do not lay a finger on Jonah himself. But their rowing is useless. The more they row, the fiercer the storm blows against them (v. 13b), and so these pagan sailors do what the Israelite prophet will not do: they pray with great reverence, asking for the Lord's mercy on the action they are about to undertake (v. 14). Their prayer could be paraphrased as follows:

<span id="page-402-8"></span><span id="page-402-6"></span>O Lord, please do not kill us for taking this man's life ("Let us not perish for this man's life").Please do not view this as the murder of an innocent person ("Lay not on us innocent blood").24 For it seems that you yourself, by means of this mighty storm, have been pleased to bring us to this point and to use us to bring judgment on this guilty man ("You, O Lord, have done as it pleased you").

In other words, "The storm provided the divine verdict and showed the penalty";25 they are simply carrying out the Lord's wishes.

<span id="page-402-9"></span>Picking Jonah up, the sailors hurl him—just like the cargo—into the sea, which immediately ceases from raging and grows calm and peaceful (v. 15). Clearly, the Lord is powerful beyond description; he has the power to start and stop such storms at will, and the sailors' fear of him is now complete. This is especially clear with a wooden translation of the relevant verses: at first the men "feared" (v. 5); a bit later they "feared a great fear" (v. 10); now they "feared the Lord with a great

<sup>25</sup> Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 464.

<span id="page-403-1"></span>fear" (v. 16). Jonah's claim to fear the Lord was shallow and hollow (v. 9); their fear of the Lord is deep and real.

<span id="page-403-4"></span>It is therefore no surprise what they do next: they offer a sacrifice to the Lord and make vows (v. 16b). The sacrifice would no doubt be one of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord for his power and deliverance, and the vows would be promises to honor him further in the future. They may have waited until reaching a temple on dry land to do these things. But there is also clear evidence in the ancient world of sacrifices being made on ships (it was not difficult to build a makeshift altar to contain the fire), and one may presume that sacrificial animals would be the last things to jettison, since these could serve as a "flare" to get the gods' attention.26 Either way, the final picture of the sailors is of their offering sacrifice to the Lord and making vows to worship him further in the future. It is the pagan sailors, not the Israelite prophet, who are the models of what it means to fear the Lord. The narrator does not say whether the sailors became completely orthodox in their beliefs; the focus is simply on the fact that these pagan men are now fearing the Lord and worshiping him, in stark contrast to the Lord's disobedient and rebellious prophet.

### *Response*

<span id="page-403-2"></span>A main theme of this chapter is that the Lord is the great God, the King who rules over all. It is he who brings the storm onto the sea (v. 4) and answers the sailors' prayers by ending it (vv. 14–15). The Lord is "God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land" (v. 9), and therefore he rules over all these things. Thus Jonah's attempt to flee from him is utterly useless—God is Lord over every place to which a person might run, and fleeing from him is like trying to flee one's own shadow (Ps. 139:7, 9–10).

<span id="page-403-5"></span><span id="page-403-0"></span>Significantly, this is not the last time in the Bible that God's mighty power will be shown by ending a powerful storm; it happens again when Jesus is in a boat with his disciples (cf. Matt. 8:18, 23–27; Mark 4:35–41; Luke 8:22–25). The stories are remarkably similar: a mighty storm comes upon the sea, and the sailors (disciples) fear for their lives while the main person in the story (Jesus) is fast asleep. But the stories are also remarkably different: Jesus is not running away from the Lord; he is right in the midst of the Lord's mission. And the storm does not stop because the sailors throw someone overboard; it stops because Jesus tells it to. He shows the same sovereign power over this storm as his Father does with Jonah's storm. Indeed, the sailors in Jesus' boat respond in the same way the sailors in Jonah's boat responded: "They were *filled with great fear* and said to one another, 'Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?'" (Mark 4:41; cf. Jonah 1:16). The question is left for the listener to answer. Jesus' actions show him to be the sovereign Lord, the one ruling over all. What do we do with this? What do we do with *him*?

<span id="page-403-3"></span><sup>26</sup> For sacrifices aboard ships in the ancient world, see references in Sasson, *Jonah*, 139.

<span id="page-404-3"></span>Along with the Lord's sovereign power, this chapter also shows a clear and surprising contrast between Jonah and the sailors. As the story unfolds, we come to see the Israelite—the one who calls himself a "Hebrew" who "fears the Lord" (v. 9)—as a rebel abandoning his calling and fleeing the Lord. At the same time, we come to see the sailors—who begin the chapter as pagans crying out in distress to foreign gods (v. 5)—as those who end up confessing the Lord's sovereign power, "fearing the Lord exceedingly," and worshiping him (vv. 14–16).

<span id="page-404-4"></span><span id="page-404-2"></span>What is the result? If you were an Israelite who began reading this narrative thinking of the Israelites as a special people who deserve the Lord's mercy and the Gentiles as wicked sinners who do not, your world has been turned upside down. The person with whom you identify most in the story—the Israelite prophet is the wicked sinner who experiences God's judgment, while those you think most deserving of judgment—the pagan sailors—are shown the Lord's mercy and respond by worshiping him. On the one hand, this is meant to humble you. The people of God can act just as sinfully as anyone else—and are just as deserving of his judgment. At the same time, it is meant to remind you that the God whom you serve delights to show his mercy to all (cf. also Isa. 2:2–4; 19:19–22; 56:6–8)—and has in fact called you for the purpose of bringing his blessing to the world (cf. Gen. 12:2–3; 1 Kings 8:41–43).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-405-2"></span><span id="page-405-1"></span>To our surprise, Jonah does not die, and his story is not over. Instead, the Lord shows him mercy and grace by sending a great creature of the sea to swallow him up and keep him alive (1:17). Jonah remains in the animal's belly for three days and nights before finally breaking out in prayer of thanksgiving to the Lord (2:1–9). The prayer ends with a ringing cry that God is a God who saves (v. 9), a truth in which Jonah himself delights (at least for the moment). In response to Jonah's prayer, the Lord commands the fish to deliver Jonah safely back to dry land (v. 10).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-405-0"></span>1:17 With the end of verse 16, we might think we have reached the end of the story. The rebellious prophet has been thrown into the sea, while pagans have turned to the Lord in worship; the story seems complete.

But it is not, for Jonah's deliverance, not his death, is the Lord's goal. God did not want to kill Jonah; he wanted to call Jonah back to himself and to the mission he had given him. The Lord in his relentless mercy continues to pursue this rebellious man.

And so the story continues. Once again showing his sovereignty over nature, "The Lord appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah" and keep him alive. The most incredible part about this is not that a sea creature swallowed Jonah;27 it is that he somehow remained alive in its belly "three days and three nights." For some, this is too hard to believe, and so they read the story as a parable. For others, this is no more difficult for the Lord than giving sight to a person born blind (John 9:1–7, 30–33), healing the incurable (Matt. 15:30–31), or raising Jesus from the dead—and doing so after three days (Matt. 12:40; Acts 4:10).28

<span id="page-406-12"></span><span id="page-406-11"></span>However we judge the historicity of the event, we are still left to wonder why Jonah waited three days and nights before praying.29 No answer is given, but there are at least three possible reasons for the length of time involved, all of which may be true. First, perhaps the details of this verse are there to orient the listener in terms of space and time. Where is Jonah? In the fish's belly. How long is he there before he prays? Three days and three nights. By orienting us to these things, the narrator helps us focus on the content of the prayer itself.30 Second, it is possible the phrase "three days and three nights" had extra significance to the original readers, such as to indicate the typical amount of time needed for a significant journey (Gen. 22:4; Ex. 3:18). Third, in the context of this story, this time period might be mentioned in order to highlight a contrast between Jonah and a different group of pagans—but we will have to wait until the next chapter to understand what that contrast might be (cf. comment on Jonah 3:5).

<span id="page-406-10"></span><span id="page-406-8"></span><span id="page-406-7"></span><span id="page-406-6"></span><span id="page-406-5"></span><span id="page-406-2"></span><span id="page-406-1"></span><span id="page-406-0"></span>2:1 The story now turns to Jonah's prayer, which is filled with biblical language, especially that of the Psalms. In fact, his prayer is most similar to a number of psalms usually considered "psalms of thanksgiving" (Psalms 18 [=2 Samuel 22]; 30; 32; 34; 66; 92; 116; 118; 138; cf. 1 Sam. 2:1–10; Isa. 38:9–20), which are characterized by thankfulness to the Lord for his protection and deliverance (cf. Jonah 2:2, 6b, 9). Such psalms usually recount the psalmist's cry for help (cf. vv. 2b, 7) and the trouble from which the Lord has delivered the psalmist (cf. vv. 2b–6a); sometimes they highlight the contrast between the righteous and the wicked (cf. vv. 8–9). For a man who was rescued from certain death because of the Lord's help, this was the perfect type of prayer to pray—and he prays it while still in the fish's belly! His trial is not yet over, but he has seen the Lord begin to work and has faith that the Lord will deliver him completely.

<span id="page-406-9"></span><sup>27</sup> The word translated "fish" can refer to a sea creature in general. It appears that sperm whales and great white sharks, both of which can be found in the Mediterranean, can grow to sufficient size to swallow a human. See Thomas H. Lineaweaver III and Richard H. Backus, *The Natural History of Sharks* (New York: Nick Lyons Books/Schocken, 1984), 34, 109–111.

<sup>28</sup> See further in Introduction: Preaching from Jonah: The Miraculous Events; Introduction: Interpretive Challenges.

<span id="page-406-4"></span><span id="page-406-3"></span><sup>29</sup> According to Israelite ways of speaking, the phrase "three days and three nights" may have meant Jonah was there until the third day after being swallowed (as opposed to a full seventy-two hours); cf. Esther 4:16 with 5:1 (C. F. Keil, *Minor Prophets* [Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1988], 398). 30 Cf. Sasson, *Jonah*, 158.

<span id="page-407-10"></span><span id="page-407-2"></span><span id="page-407-1"></span>2:2 Jonah's prayer begins by summarizing his distress and deliverance. His distress was clearly severe, as shown by the mention of "Sheol," which represents the realm of death (1 Sam. 2:6; Ps. 6:5; Hos. 13:14); a person going to Sheol was a person who was going to die, whether righteous (Gen. 37:35) or unrighteous (Pss. 9:16; 31:17). Indeed, to be in Sheol's belly is to be swallowed up by death itself, to be as good as dead. But Jonah knew the Lord could deliver from the power of death (cf. Pss. 30:3; 86:13; 116:3–6), so he called out to him, and the Lord, in keeping with his mighty power, heard Jonah's prayer and answered it.

<span id="page-407-11"></span><span id="page-407-7"></span>2:3–6 With this summary in place, Jonah now goes back in time to describe his trial in terrifying detail. First, he makes clear it was the Lord's judgment: "The sailors may have hurled me overboard, but they were simply your hands. *You*, O Lord, have cast me here! These are *your* waves and *your* billows that now pass over me in judgment!" Jonah also makes clear that his punishment is to be entombed in a watery grave, from which he has no chance of escape: he is in the very "heart of the seas," there is water "surrounding" him on all sides, and mighty "waves" and "billows" form a ceiling of water above his head.

<span id="page-407-0"></span>In light of these events, it is natural for Jonah to conclude that he has been "driven away" from the Lord's sight (v. 4). The Hebrew word for "drive away" (*garash*) is strong; in some instances it comes close to our word "banish" (Gen. 3:24; 21:10), which fits the context here: he has been banished from the Lord's presence.

<span id="page-407-12"></span><span id="page-407-8"></span><span id="page-407-6"></span><span id="page-407-5"></span><span id="page-407-3"></span>This leads to the second half of Jonah 2:4, where there is a translation issue. The Hebrew text is a statement: "Yet [Hb. *'ak*]I shall again look upon your holy temple" (ESV). The "holy temple" is the place where the Lord dwells (Ps. 18:6), which can refer either to the Jerusalem temple (Ps. 79:1) or to the heavenly temple (Ps. 11:4).31 The verb "look" is used elsewhere to describe both looking at a physical object (1 Kings 18:43) and looking figuratively to the Lord for help (Ps. 34:5). Jonah is thus saying either that he would be saved and make it back to Jerusalem, or—if speaking figuratively—that he would be able to return to the Lord's presence and seek his help. Others translate this as a question: "*How* [Hb. *'ek*] shall I again look upon your holy temple?" (RSV). This follows one version of the ancient Greek, and the difference in Hebrew is only the one letter (*'ek* vs. *'ak*). In either case, as Jonah feels separated from the Lord, his thoughts turn to the place where the Lord's presence is most keenly felt: his temple.

<span id="page-407-13"></span><span id="page-407-9"></span>Jonah's sense of despair only deepens in Jonah 2:5–6a. The word for "life" (*nephesh*) can refer to the "throat" or "neck" (Ps. 105:18); he is literally "up to his neck" in trouble, the waters completely surrounding him. His head is "wrapped" in seaweed, a turban worn only by those about to sink into a watery grave. And sink he does! The "roots of the mountains" (Jonah 2:6a) represent the very bottom of the sea,32 described here as "the land33 whose bars closed upon me forever." Jonah

<span id="page-407-15"></span><sup>31</sup> Sasson, *Jonah*, 181.

<sup>32</sup> The ancients saw that land rose up out of the water along the coastline and naturally concluded that it descended below the water as well.

<span id="page-407-14"></span><span id="page-407-4"></span><sup>33</sup> The word "land" may refer here to the underworld. "In the Bible we do not find the image of a gate ["bars"; v. 6] with reference to the land of the living, but only with reference to the land of the dead: 'the gates of Sheol' (Isa. 38:10); 'the gates of death' (Pss. 9:14 and 107:18; Job 38:17)" (Simon, *Jonah*, 22).

<span id="page-408-4"></span>paints a terrifying picture of a fortified city fastened shut with heavy "bars" to prevent its gates from being opened (cf. 1 Sam. 23:7)—he is locked in this city of death with no way of getting out. He has been "going down" and away from the Lord since the beginning of the story (Jonah 1:3, 5), and now he has "gone down" and away from the Lord as far as he can go. He has no hope of saving himself.

<span id="page-408-9"></span><span id="page-408-8"></span>But what is impossible for him is not impossible for the Lord. Jonah had descended to the land of the dead, into a pit from which he could not escape, but the Lord "brought up [his] life from the pit" (v. 6b), a deliverance he will now describe in more detail.

<span id="page-408-12"></span><span id="page-408-10"></span><span id="page-408-7"></span><span id="page-408-6"></span>2:7–9 Jonah's trial is so severe that his life is "fainting away" (2:7), language that can describe those who pass out from hunger or injury (Ps. 107:5; Lam. 2:12), but also those so overcome with trial and affliction that they have lost all strength and hope (Pss. 61:2; 102:1; 142:3; 143:4). At this point of total despair, Jonah "remembered the Lord" (Jonah 2:7). In the Bible, the word "remember" often refers to mental activity accompanied by physical action. It is "to act on the basis of knowledge."34 At this point, in the midst of his troubles, Jonah remembers the reality of who the Lord is and acts accordingly by crying out to him for help. Indeed, in the Hebrew, the Lord's name comes first for emphasis: "*The Lord* I remembered."

The result is remarkable. Earlier, Jonah had thought he could never again look to the Lord in his "holy temple" for help (cf. comment on 2:3–6). But here he realizes this is not true. In his despair, he cries out to the Lord in his "holy temple," and the Lord hears (v. 7b). Jonah experiences the truth that it is never too late to lift his eyes to a God so rich in mercy and love.

<span id="page-408-11"></span><span id="page-408-5"></span>Jonah then does what sometimes happens in prayers of thanksgiving: he describes his own hope and faith in the Lord and contrasts himself with those who put their faith and hope in other things (vv. 8–9; cf. Pss. 32:10; 34:15–22; 92:5–15). Such a contrast emphasizes that the Lord does indeed help those who look to him in obedient faith, and he encourages those in the midst of trial to stay true to the Lord instead of looking elsewhere for salvation. In this context, those who do not hope in the Lord "pay regard to vain idols" (Jonah 2:8a). The words "vain idols" could be translated more woodenly as "worthless things of fleeting vapors," emphasizing that placing hope in such things is utterly useless; it is like trying to get out of a hole by grabbing onto the wind. Only the Lord can save.

<span id="page-408-13"></span>As shown in table 6.2, the second half of verse 8 could be translated in two different ways with two different meanings.35

Page, "Jonah," in *Amos, Obadiah, Jonah: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture*, NAC (Nashville: Broadman & Holman, 1995), 252. For example, when the Lord "remembers" someone, he shines his favor on them (Gen. 8:1; 19:29; 30:22; Num. 10:9) and affirms his covenant faithfulness to them (Gen. 9:15, 16; Ex. 2:24; 6:5; Lev. 26:45).

In the two examples most similar to our verse grammatically, the pronoun attached to "steadfast love" refers to

<span id="page-409-6"></span>TABLE 6.2: Two Possible Translations and Meanings of Jonah 2:8

In either case, Jonah is describing those who seek salvation in that which could never provide it.

<span id="page-409-7"></span>By way of contrast, Jonah looks to the Lord alone (v. 9). It was common for Israelites to make a vow to the Lord when their prayer was especially serious. Such a vow was often a promise to present a sacrifice to the Lord at the temple if the prayer was answered. The vow's purpose was not to "make a deal" with the Lord— Yahweh does not make deals with people. Rather, it was a way of underscoring the seriousness of the prayer and also of making sure an appropriate response of thanks and praise was given: when Israelites fulfilled a sacrificial vow, they went to the temple and gave public thanks and praise to the Lord for how he had been faithful to them (cf. Pss. 107:20–22; 116:17–19).

<span id="page-409-5"></span><span id="page-409-2"></span>Jonah's words imply that, in the midst of his prayer for help, he had made a vow to the Lord. He now affirms that he will be faithful to fulfill his vow and offer sacrifice. Ironically, however, the same language has already been used to describe the pagan sailors doing the same things in their worship of the Lord (Jonah 1:16) and doing so long before Jonah! The significance of this will be commented on in the "Response" section below.

<span id="page-409-1"></span>In the prayer's final words, Jonah makes the reason for his thanksgiving and praise abundantly clear: "Salvation belongs to the Lord!" In this context, "salvation" refers to "deliverance from trial," which is how the term is commonly used in the OT (Ex. 14:13; Pss. 3:8; 13:5; 35:10; etc.). This of course paves the way for its use in the NT to refer specifically to deliverance from the ultimate trial: eternal death (Rom. 1:16; 10:1; 1 Thess. 5:9; etc.). But in both cases, OT and NT, the emphasis is on the fact that salvation is found in the Lord. He is its source. It is because of his great power that he can deliver from trial, and it is because of his great mercy that he does so—and this is what makes him worthy of worship and praise.

The implication is that the discipline has worked or at least has begun to work. Instead of fleeing from the presence of the Lord (1:3), Jonah has now turned back to him to carry out his original mission. He has experienced the Lord's mercy and grace in the most profound ways—but will this change his heart in an equally profound way?

#### *Response*

<span id="page-410-10"></span><span id="page-410-5"></span><span id="page-410-0"></span>In many places, the Bible describes how the Lord, like a loving parent, brings strong discipline on his wayward children to direct them back to obedience and thus to the good paths in which he wants them to walk (e.g., Prov. 3:11–12; 1 Cor. 11:32; Heb. 12:4–7). This is exactly what happens here. Jonah had been fleeing from the Lord since the story's beginning (Jonah 1:3), a flight that took him in an increasing spiral downward (cf. comment on 1:3). The Lord disciplines Jonah by propelling him further down this path—to the very bottom of the sea (2:6)! It is as though he says to Jonah, "You want to flee from me? Then let me make very clear where this path will lead!" As a result of such discipline, he brings Jonah to the complete end of his own strength and ability. Jonah comes to his senses and turns back to the Lord, finally "calling out" to him for help (2:2). This is one of the goals of the Lord's discipline of his children when they disobey: he desires them to turn back to him in obedient faith, walking in his paths and thus in close fellowship with him.

<span id="page-410-6"></span><span id="page-410-4"></span><span id="page-410-3"></span><span id="page-410-2"></span><span id="page-410-1"></span>It is impossible to hear Jonah's prayer in light of chapter 1 without noting a strong point of irony. There, the pagan sailors were in danger from the sea, and they "called out to the Lord" for help (1:14), and responded to his deliverance with "sacrifice" and "vows" (1:16). Here, we are told Jonah was in danger from the sea, "called out to the Lord" for help (2:2), and responded to his deliverance with "sacrifice" and "vows" (2:9). In other words, the Israelite prophet has finally arrived at the same point to which the pagans have already come! He is not modeling for them what it means to look to the Lord in faith; he is following their model. Once again, this is meant to humble the Israelites who are reading this; the pagans they despise are quicker to realize their need of the Lord and turn to him in worship than the Israelite prophet who ministers in the Lord's name. This should banish all their spiritual pride. When it comes to sin, all are equal before the Lord in terms of need for mercy, and it is sometimes those who do not know him that realize this need more quickly. Jesus himself emphasizes this in his parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector (Luke 18:9–14). Those who compare themselves to others will always find reasons for pride; those who compare themselves to the Lord will realize their own wickedness, cry out humbly for his mercy and salvation, and then extend this mercy to others.

<span id="page-410-8"></span><span id="page-410-7"></span>Jonah's own spiritual pride should have been humbled, of course, by the simple fact that he received what he did not deserve: mercy instead of judgment, deliverance instead of death. This should have changed Jonah profoundly. It should change us profoundly. What our sin and rebellion earn is death (Rom. 6:23). What God makes available to us in Jesus is life, an undeserved gift of his mercy and grace (Eph. 2:1–9). This should destroy any spiritual pride we might have.

<span id="page-410-9"></span>As for Jonah, he should now go to the Ninevites, hoping his preaching will turn their hearts back to the Lord, hoping they will somehow realize that the Lord is merciful to those who call out to him for deliverance and salvation. After all, Jonah himself has just experienced this in the most dramatic way. Surely he of all people will now hope that others will have the same experience of mercy and grace.

## JONAH 3:1–10

<span id="page-411-1"></span>3 Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, saying, **<sup>2</sup>** "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it the message that I tell you." **<sup>3</sup>** So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city,*<sup>1</sup>* three days' journey in breadth.*<sup>2</sup>* **<sup>4</sup>** Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!" **5**And the people of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.

**<sup>6</sup>**The word reached*<sup>3</sup>* the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. **7**And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water, **8**but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. **9**Who knows? God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish."

**<sup>10</sup>**When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.

<span id="page-411-3"></span><span id="page-411-2"></span><span id="page-411-0"></span>Now that Jonah has turned back to the Lord, the Lord gives him a second chance to carry out his mission to the Ninevites (vv. 1–2). Arriving in that huge and important city, Jonah begins to declare a message of coming doom (vv. 3–4). Amazingly, the Ninevites respond with immediate faith, as they all humble themselves before God (v. 5). The king himself responds in the same way (v. 6) and sends a proclamation throughout the city commanding the entire community to humble itself with fasting and sackcloth and to cry out to God (vv. 7–8). Along with these signs of repentance, he also commands the people to turn from evil in the hope that God himself will turn from the disaster they deserve (vv. 8–9). In his mercy and grace, the Lord accepts their repentance and relents from bringing his justice to bear against them. In wrath, he remembers mercy (Hab. 3:2), because he is a God who is compassionate and gracious.

## *Comment*

3:1–2 With these two verses, it is as if everything were "back to square one" (cf. 1:1–2). When the story began, Jonah rebelled against the Lord and his call to preach in Nineveh. As a result, Jonah experienced first the Lord's discipline and then his merciful deliverance. Now, as a further sign of God's mercy and grace, Jonah is given a second chance to bring God's message to Nineveh.

<span id="page-412-3"></span><span id="page-412-1"></span>3:3–4 "So Jonah arose," not to flee from the Lord (as in 1:3) but to go "to Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord" (3:3). The story we should have been anticipating from the beginning can finally start.

The narrator pauses briefly to describe Nineveh for us, and the description is best captured by the ESV footnotes for verse 3: "Now Nineveh was a great city to God, [and] a visit was a three days' journey." The word translated "journey" (*mahalak*) is used elsewhere to refer to how long a visit would take (as opposed to how far a person had to go to make the visit).36 In this context, the sense is that Nineveh was so large and important that to visit it properly required a full three days. In comparison to most little villages and towns in the ancient world, where you could see everything important in an hour or two, Nineveh was huge. This naturally implied it had many people within it, which explains why it was "a great city to God," that is, important to him; many lives were at stake (cf. comment on 4:10–11).

<span id="page-412-6"></span><span id="page-412-5"></span>So "Jonah began to go into the city," preaching his message of warning on that first day: "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!" (v. 4). At several places in the Bible, forty days represents a significant amount of time,

<span id="page-412-0"></span><sup>36</sup> See Nehemiah 2:6: "How long will your *mahalak* be?" is well translated as "How long will you be gone?" (ESV). There is therefore no need to try and explain (as is sometimes done) that Nineveh was so large it took three days to walk around its walls or straight from one end to the other.

<span id="page-413-12"></span><span id="page-413-0"></span>whether of judgment (Gen. 7:4, 12), instruction (Ex. 24:18; 34:28), or repentance (Deut. 9:18).37 The people of Nineveh are thus given a significant amount of time to heed the message and turn from their evil (cf. Jonah 1:2). Failure to do so would be disastrous—when a city was "overthrown" it was annihilated, as were Sodom and Gomorrah (cf. Gen. 19:21, 25). The Ninevites have been warned: the Lord is about to bring his justice to bear against them.

<span id="page-413-15"></span><span id="page-413-4"></span><span id="page-413-2"></span><span id="page-413-1"></span>3:5 And the people of Nineveh believe it! The phrase "believed God" is used elsewhere to describe Israelites who put their faith and trust in the Lord (Gen. 15:6; Ex. 14:31),38 and that is what happens here. The entire city believes Jonah's God is living and real, and therefore they turn to him with humble repentance.

<span id="page-413-14"></span>It may be noted that Jonah's message did not mention repentance as an option (Jonah 3:4). It did not need to. When a prophet declared that judgment was coming because of evil, it was to be understood that the judgment would take place *if repentance did not*. The Lord makes this especially clear in Jeremiah: "If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it" (Jer. 18:7–8). The prophet's warning thus becomes an invitation to repent.

<span id="page-413-11"></span><span id="page-413-3"></span>The Ninevites take this warning and invitation fully to heart; they "called for a fast and put on sackcloth." In the context of repentance, fasting was a way to humble yourself before God and devote time to confessing your sins to him (1 Sam. 7:6; Dan. 9:3). Similarly, sackcloth was a sign of mourning (Gen. 37:34; 2 Sam. 3:31), just as black clothing is in many societies today; in contexts of repentance, it was a way of saying, "I am grieving because of the wrong I have done" (1 Kings 21:27).

<span id="page-413-13"></span><span id="page-413-9"></span><span id="page-413-6"></span>It is almost impossible not to notice the contrast here between the Ninevites and Jonah. It took Jonah three days to reach the point where he could utter his prayer of thanksgiving to the Lord (Jonah 1:17–2:1). But here—when Jonah is only on *day one* of a city that takes *three days* to visit—the people are already turning to the Lord. Once more, the pagans are far more spiritually sensitive and humble than the Hebrew prophet.

<span id="page-413-16"></span>3:6 It is not just the general public that repents. News of the people's repentance and presumably the preaching of Jonah that was prompting it—"reached the king of Nineveh,"39 who immediately repents as well. Instead of remaining on his royal throne, he sits down in the ashes—another sign of deep grief in the ancient world (Jer. 6:26; Dan. 9:3). Instead of wearing his royal robe, he puts on the sackcloth of those mourning their sin. In the span of one verse, he has gone from supreme authority to utter humility.

<span id="page-413-5"></span><sup>38</sup> Or to describe times when they did not (Num. 14:11; Deut. 1:32; 2 Kings 17:14; Ps. 78:22).

<span id="page-413-8"></span><span id="page-413-7"></span><sup>39</sup> That is, the king of Assyria. It has been noted that Israelites may "speak of a king in terms of his capital or chief city," as when Ahab is called "king of Samaria" (1 Kings 21:1) in place of his regular title "king of Israel" (1 Kings 20:2, 13; 21:18) (Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 441).

<span id="page-414-6"></span><span id="page-414-5"></span><span id="page-414-4"></span>3:7–9 The king then issues a proclamation for the entire city, calling for the most extreme forms of repentance possible (vv. 7–8). No food or water may be consumed, sackcloth must be worn by all, and the whole city must pray fervently; even the animals are to be included in the outward signs of repentance (v. 7). What is more, the king states that the people's outward signs of repentance must be matched by their turning from their evil ways and the wrong they have done ("the violence that is in his hands"; v. 8). The king realizes that outward signs of repentance like fasting or sackcloth or prayer—are useless if not accompanied by a change of life (v. 8; cf. Isa. 58:3–9). He does not know whether his people's repentance will be accepted ("Who knows?"), but he hopes that Jonah's God will see it and relent from bringing his justice to bear against them (Jonah 3:9).

<span id="page-414-9"></span><span id="page-414-8"></span><span id="page-414-7"></span><span id="page-414-1"></span><span id="page-414-0"></span>3:10 This is exactly what happens. Seeing that they had all "turned from their evil way," the Lord "relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them."40 As one commentator poetically notes, "When Nineveh repented, God relented."41 Truly, he is "a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger . . . forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin" (Ex. 34:6–7). Jonah himself had already experienced the Lord's mercy and forgiveness for his own evil behavior—but will he be delighted that the Ninevites have experienced the same?

## *Response*

<span id="page-414-3"></span><span id="page-414-2"></span>This chapter begins with the Lord telling Jonah to preach a message of imminent doom to the wicked Ninevites (3:1–4). The point is clear: God brings justice to bear against evil, and evil Nineveh is about to experience his justice. But the Lord's desire for the Ninevites is not destruction but deliverance. The message he told Jonah to preach was to be a warning against their evil as well as an invitation to turn from it (cf. comment on 3:5). And turn from it they did! On the first day of Jonah's preaching, everyone in the city — from the king to the lowest servant and even to the livestock— is clothed in sackcloth, fasting, and crying out mightily to God. What is more, these outward signs of repentance are accompanied by the Ninevites' turning from the evil for which they had been condemned. Their behavior is a model of true repentance and faith, as Jesus himself makes clear:

<span id="page-414-12"></span><span id="page-414-11"></span>Jesus declared that the Ninevites will stand up in the day of judgment to condemn the scribes and Pharisees for their unbelief (cf. Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:30–32). The Ninevites believed after one short sermon without signs, whereas the scribes and Pharisees heard many sermons of Jesus and saw many signs yet still refused to believe.42

<sup>40</sup> The word for "evil" and "disaster" is the same in Hebrew (*raʻah*). We might capture this in English by saying that because they turned from their "bad" (evil) behavior, the Lord turned from bringing them to a "bad" (disastrous) end (cf. Allen, *Jonah*, 226). Cf. comment on 4:1.

<span id="page-414-10"></span><sup>41</sup> Stuart, *Hosea–Jonah*, 495.

<sup>42</sup> Page, "Jonah," 267.

<span id="page-415-1"></span>In response to their repentance, the Lord extends his forgiveness (Jonah 3:10), which has been his real desire all along:

<span id="page-415-4"></span><span id="page-415-3"></span>God is patient, "not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance" (2 Pet. 3:9). . . . He "wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4). He manifests his sovereignty not in stubbornness but in grace; not in narrow particularism but in a willingness to forgive *any* people.43

<span id="page-415-0"></span>To the Israelites, this should be especially clear in Jonah 3:10, which borrows language from a story in their past. Just as the Lord "relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to" the Ninevites for their evil, there was a time when he "relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on" the Israelites for their evil (Ex. 32:14; the Hebrew is exactly the same in Jonah and Exodus). Once more, this is meant to humble the Israelites. No longer can they look down on other nations for their evil, delighting in their coming judgment, when they themselves have been just as evil and just as much in need of the Lord's mercy and grace. If Israel received this needed mercy and grace, should they not desire it for others who need it? And if we have experienced this same mercy and grace through Jesus, should our hearts not burn with desire for others to experience it as well?

As for Jonah, he had experienced the Lord's mercy and grace in the last chapter. Surely he will now respond with deep praise to the Lord for showing this same mercy and grace to others. This might be our hope as we enter the next chapter, but we should be ready to be deeply disappointed.

## <span id="page-415-2"></span>JONAH 4:1–11

4 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly,*<sup>1</sup>* and he was angry. **2**And he prayed to the Lord and said, "O Lord, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country?

And he said, "Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die." **10**And the Lord said, "You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. **11**And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?"

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-416-0"></span>Instead of rejoicing at the Lord's mercy to Nineveh, Jonah is greatly "displeased" (4:1). His angry prayer finally shows why he did not want to go to Nineveh in the first place: he was afraid they might repent and that the Lord would forgive them (v. 2). Fed up, Jonah asks the Lord to end his life (v. 3), to which the Lord responds with a question: Is this the correct attitude (v. 4)? In reply Jonah leaves the city, builds himself a shelter outside its walls, and waits, hoping the Lord might still send disaster on Nineveh (v. 5). Instead, the Lord creates an object lesson for Jonah in the hope of helping him understand the goodness of his worldwide grace, mercy, love, and forgiveness (vv. 6–11). The lesson ends with the Lord asking Jonah another question: Should he not show his grace, mercy, love and forgiveness to all, even to the Ninevehs of the world (v. 11)? We are not told how Jonah responds, because at that point it is not his response that matters—it is ours.

<span id="page-417-10"></span><span id="page-417-9"></span><span id="page-417-8"></span><span id="page-417-7"></span><span id="page-417-6"></span><span id="page-417-2"></span><span id="page-417-1"></span><span id="page-417-0"></span>4:1 The chapter begins with a brilliant yet tragic play on words. It involves a Hebrew root (*raʻah*) that can refer to something "morally bad" (evil; Gen. 50:15; Jonah 1:2), to a "bad thing" that befalls someone (disaster/discomfort; Ezek. 7:5; Jonah 1:7–8), or to something that one "considers to be bad" (displeasing), either in a general way (Gen. 48:17; Num. 22:34; Josh. 24:15) or because it is morally wrong and thus displeasing either to people (1 Sam. 8:6; Neh. 13:8) or to the Lord (Gen. 38:10; 2 Sam. 11:27). All three senses of this Hebrew word occur in this verse and the one immediately preceding it (Jonah 3:10). Chapter 3 ends with the Ninevites' turning from their "evil" (*raʻah*), so that the Lord turns from bringing on them the "disaster" (*raʻah*) they deserve (v. 10). The reader would hope that Jonah—who just received the Lord's lavish mercy and forgiveness for his own evil (ch. 2)—might again break out in a prayer of thanksgiving. Instead, we are told the Lord's mercy is "displeasing" (*raʻah*) to him—and "exceedingly" so.44 Jonah considered it gravely wrong for the Lord to show such mercy and grace to such a wicked people. He was "scandalized by the inclusiveness of God's mercy."45

<span id="page-417-11"></span><span id="page-417-4"></span><span id="page-417-3"></span>4:2–3 This becomes especially clear in his prayer, where the reader is told for the first time why Jonah fled from the Lord and his mission: he knew it might result in the Lord's forgiving this people. As Jonah begins to explain this, he displays a shocking depth of self-centered blindness.46 In his prayer, Jonah recites some of the most precious truths about the Lord's character that the Israelites have ever experienced as a people. In fact, he uses language from one of the darkest moments of Israel's history: when they build a golden calf and bow down before it in worship (Ex. 32:1–6). It is in that context, when the Lord forgives his sinful people, that we first read that he is a God who "relents from disaster" (Ex. 32:12, 14). It is in that context, when the Lord renews the covenant with them—the one they have just broken—that we first read that he is a God "merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love" (Ex. 34:6). Jonah's own undeserving people had benefited from this mercy and grace. Yet somehow, when the Lord shows this same mercy and grace to others, Jonah is filled not with praise but with a discouraged anger that burns so deeply that he wants to die (Jonah 4:3). If God is going to forgive people who Jonah thinks are too wicked to deserve it, Jonah does not want to live in such a world. "'Over my dead body' is his vehement reaction to God's grace."47

<span id="page-417-13"></span><span id="page-417-12"></span><span id="page-417-5"></span>4:4 The Lord responds with a searching question: "Do you do well to be angry?" (v. 4). In other words, "Is this the right response?" In this context in particular, the issue is clear: "Is it right to be angry that the same mercy and grace you yourself have received from the Lord is shown to other people?"

<sup>44</sup> Allen captures the wordplay in English as follows: "Bad behavior should lead to a bad end, and Jonah takes it very badly that it does not" ( *Jonah*, 227).

<span id="page-418-5"></span><span id="page-418-4"></span><span id="page-418-3"></span>4:5 Instead of responding, Jonah leaves the city, makes a temporary shelter (the heat of a Middle Eastern day can be dangerously oppressive), and waits to "see what would become of the city." At first glance, this seems curious. Jonah's response in verses 1–3 suggests he already knows disaster will not come (presumably because the Lord has made it known to him or because the forty days have passed). If so, why does he go out of the city to see what will happen? Some have answered this question by suggesting that verses 5–11 are a flashback.48 This is not impossible, but it is not the most natural reading of the Hebrew. The Hebrew verb form at the verse's beginning usually indicates subsequent action, so verse 5 is most naturally read as describing what happens next. It may therefore simply be that Jonah goes out of the city in hopes that the Lord's judgment will still come.49 From Jonah's perspective, this is exactly what should happen, and so he sits stubbornly in his shelter hoping that it does.

<span id="page-418-6"></span>4:6 The Lord responds with an object lesson; he still wants Jonah to understand that his mercy and grace are not to be hoarded but to be shared freely and widely. The lesson begins with familiar language. Just as the Lord had "appointed" a great fish to keep Jonah alive miraculously for three days and deliver him from the sea (1:17), here the Lord "appoints" a plant to grow up miraculously in a day and deliver Jonah from the sun, providing extra shade that the shelter could not provide.

<span id="page-418-2"></span><span id="page-418-1"></span><span id="page-418-0"></span>But like the great fish, this plant is about more than rescue; it, too, has been appointed by the Lord to teach Jonah a lesson about mercy and grace. The narrator makes this clear by using the same play on words as in 3:10–4:1. The Ninevites were rescued from "disaster/discomfort" (*raʻah*) (3:10), and Jonah was "exceedingly displeased" (*raʻah*) (4:1); in this verse, it is Jonah who is rescued from "disaster/ discomfort" (*raʻah*)—and he is "exceedingly *glad*." He has experienced the very same thing as the Ninevites and yet responds in exactly the opposite way! This selfcentered hypocrisy would have been impossible for the original audience to miss, but somehow Jonah does miss it; yet the Lord is about to make it abundantly clear.

<span id="page-418-8"></span><span id="page-418-7"></span>4:7–8 Having delivered Jonah from discomfort (*raʻah*) for a day (v. 6), the Lord withdraws his deliverance and allows Jonah to experience discomfort in all its strength. He appoints a worm to come and kill the plant (v. 7). The saving shade is now gone, and as the sun rises to bake Jonah in the desert sand, the Lord appoints a scorching east wind that "blows its hot breath through the . . . shelter till it feels like an oven."50 Jonah is growing faint; his discomfort is fast becoming a disaster.

At this point, the listener might hope that Jonah will finally get it, that he will cry out, "O Lord, now I see! To experience disaster is a horrible thing! I could not wish this on my worst enemies! Forgive me for being so merciless, so lacking in compassion and grace!"

<sup>49</sup> Keil, *Minor Prophets*, 412–413; Page, "Jonah," 279–280; Achtemeier, *Minor Prophets*, 281.

<sup>50</sup> Allen, *Jonah*, 233.

<span id="page-419-0"></span>Instead, Jonah's heart becomes even harder, and he once more angrily asks the Lord to put him to death. His precious plant is dead, and the Lord seems to care nothing about the resulting disaster. The irony is astounding. Earlier, Jonah had wanted to die because of his anger that the Ninevites had been delivered from their disaster (v. 3); now he wants to die because of his anger for not being delivered from his own disaster! Somehow, he remains convinced he deserves deliverance from disaster but others do not—that his evil deserves forgiveness while the evil of others deserves judgment.

<span id="page-419-2"></span><span id="page-419-1"></span>4:9 The Lord responds by repeating the question he left hanging in verse 4. This time, however, he ties it into the object lesson that Jonah is unknowingly in the midst of: "Do you do well to be angry for the plant?" In other words, is such anger over a simple plant the right response? This time—finally!—Jonah answers the question, but the answer he gives is shocking: "Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die." In other words, "Of course I should be angry! That plant meant so much to me that its destruction was a horrible wrong! It should enjoy life, not death! Blessing, not curse! Mercy and compassion, not disaster!"

The attentive listener cannot help but think, "Jonah, if this is true for a plant, is it not all the more true for a city full of people?" And it is this very thought the Lord now puts into words.

<span id="page-419-3"></span>4:10–11 God does so by drawing a striking contrast between Jonah's reaction to the plant and his reaction to Nineveh. He first describes the plant (v. 10), and everything about the Lord's description is meant to underscore how little the plant should mean to Jonah. He did not spend hours laboring over it; he did not cause it to grow; he had no time to get attached to it. It was just a day-old weed that happened to grow up beside his shelter.

<span id="page-419-4"></span>How different it is when it comes to the Lord and the city of Nineveh (v. 11)! Everything about the Lord's description of the city is meant to underscore how much it should mean to Jonah. We could paraphrase God's declaration: "Nineveh has more than 120,000 people51 in it! People made in my image! And they are utterly lost, with no idea of what is right and wrong; they are like little children who cannot even tell the difference between their right hand and their left. And even if you do not care about the people, just think about all those animals! So go ahead, put your plant on one side of a scale and all these things on the other side. Which is weightier? Which matters more? If you can feel sorry for this meager and meaningless plant, should I not feel sorry for all these people made in my image? Jonah, do you not get it?! Are not the animals of the city alone worth more pity than your puny plant?"52

No response is recorded. Once again, the Lord's question hangs in the air unanswered. This is intentional—when a story ends with a question, the only

<sup>51</sup> This aligns with what we know from history. At its height, Nineveh is estimated to have had at least 300,000 residents (Sasson, *Jonah*, 312).

<span id="page-419-5"></span><sup>52</sup> The Lord's words (as paraphrased here) express the "same divine compassion that Jesus reflected in his reaction to crowds of people" (Allen, *Jonah*, 234; he cites Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34; 8:2).

ones who can answer it are the readers. The question forces us to think about the answer, forces us to fill in the blank. What is our response?

### *Response*

The Bible tells of a God who delights to show grace, mercy, love, and forgiveness to sinful humanity. Rather than simply turn his back on our rebellion, the Lord continually comes toward us, calling us to turn from our harmful and evil ways and come back to him. And to those who heed his call, he gives a mission: help those around you also to experience his grace, mercy, love, and forgiveness. This is in fact the very mission he gave the Israelites when he called them to be a "kingdom of priests" (Ex. 19:6):

<span id="page-420-0"></span>As a kingdom of priests, Israel is called to represent the nations before God, to mediate God's redemptive purpose in the world. A priest stands between God and the people, representing each to the other. . . . Yahweh here summons Israel as an entire nation to act as a priest, a covenantal mediator between him and the rest of the world. In this priestly service, he expects Israel to pray for, love, minister to, and witness to the nations.53

<span id="page-420-4"></span>But Jonah has forgotten Israel's mission entirely. He has no compassion for the nations; he regards them not as potential recipients of God's mercy but merely as objects of his judgment. He is not interested in their deliverance; he is interested only in their destruction. He cannot imagine a world in which others receive the same mercy and grace as Israel. In NT times, things were often the same. The separation between Jew and Gentile was so strong that at first even the disciples had a hard time understanding that they should go and share the good news of Jesus with the nations (cf. Acts 10:1–11:18). It is perhaps not a coincidence that when Peter first receives his call to share the good news of Jesus with the Gentiles, he is at Joppa (Acts 10:5). The place to which Jonah fled to escape preaching to the Gentiles (Jonah 1:3) is the very place where the Lord makes clear to Peter that he must do so. God cares for all the nations! Christians today may well ask themselves, Do we really believe this to be true? Do we really believe God loves those in Muslim nations? Hindu nations? Buddhist nations? Do we speak of people from these nations as though they really bear God's image and are in need of his grace? Or do our thoughts and words and deeds betray a different attitude?

<span id="page-420-5"></span><span id="page-420-2"></span><span id="page-420-1"></span>It is natural to ask, Why was Jonah's attitude so different from the Lord's? A significant part of the answer is that he had forgotten the depth of his own need for God's grace, mercy, and forgiveness (cf. comment on 4:2–3). Those who forget their need of mercy are the quickest to withhold it from others. Those who forget their experience of God's forgiveness are the quickest to refuse it to others. Jesus told a parable about a servant who was forgiven much by a king but then refused to extend that same forgiveness to a fellow servant (Matt. 18:23–35). The king was

<span id="page-420-3"></span><sup>53</sup> Williams, *Far as the Curse Is Found*, 138.

<span id="page-421-0"></span>justly furious: "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?" (vv. 32–33). Jesus' point was clear: If you have received such mercy and forgiveness from the King of heaven, you cannot withhold it from anyone else.

And this leads to a final point. It was noted above that the book of Jonah ends with a question, one that the reader is forced to answer. Many will want to shout, "Jonah, answer him! Say to him, 'O Lord, of course you should have such mercy! You have been so merciful to me! How can I not want the same mercy for others? O Lord, of course you should forgive! You have so freely forgiven me! How can I not show the same forgiveness to others?'"

This is, of course, the right answer. The question that remains is whether it is simply the answer of our lips or whether it is the answer of our lives. Do we really want these things for others? There is an easy way to tell. In Jesus, we have experienced God's abundant grace, mercy, love, and forgiveness. If we show these same things to everyone we meet, no matter who they are—no matter their morals, race, nationality, social class, gender, political beliefs, etc.—then we have understood well the lesson of this book and the heart of our Savior. But if we show these things to some people and not to others; if we show these things to those like us but not to those who are different; if we show these things to those we like but not to those we dislike; if we are in any way selective in terms of the people to whom we show God's grace, mercy, love, and forgiveness, then we still do not get it. We remain disciples of Jonah, not disciples of Jesus.

## INTRODUCTION TO

# MICAH

### *Overview*

<span id="page-425-6"></span><span id="page-425-1"></span>The book of Micah is found in the middle of the Minor Prophets, and in fact it contains the middle verse of the twelve minor prophets: a prophecy of judgment on the holy city of Zion and its temple (3:12). Within the Minor Prophets, Micah is in the middle of a trio of books (Jonah, Micah, Nahum) dealing with the nation of Assyria and with Israel's and Judah's relation to this hostile power. Jonah and Nahum deal with the salvation and judgment of Assyria, respectively, while Micah deals mostly with the impending judgment on Judah at the hands of the Assyrians, as well as with the eventual judgment of Assyria itself.

<span id="page-425-3"></span>Micah is set in the late eighth century BC and represents a collection of oracles that the prophet Micah pronounced at various times throughout his ministry to the southern kingdom of Judah. Micah witnessed the collapse of the northern kingdom of Israel, which he had predicted (1:6–7), as well as the near collapse of the southern kingdom of Judah, which he had announced also (1:8–16; 3:9–12). However, because the southern king and his people repented, judgment was averted (Jer. 26:18–19).

<span id="page-425-5"></span><span id="page-425-4"></span><span id="page-425-2"></span><span id="page-425-0"></span>Micah's collection of oracles is not simply an arbitrary arrangement but is highly organized in a triad of units that stress judgment first and then salvation. In many ways, this trilogy might be likened to a symphony, in which similar themes are repeated and intensified before finally building to a crescendo. The first unit of the book (Mic. 1:2–2:13) contains mostly judgment, with some relief provided in a final salvation oracle (2:12–13). The second unit continues the judgment (3:1–12) and then looks ahead to a future of salvation that will be possible only by means of suffering (4:1–5:15). The final unit continues the judgment (6:1–7:7) but looks beyond the darkness to the final salvation, which is effectively captured in a final vision of a transcendent God who fulfills his covenant (7:8–20).

<span id="page-425-11"></span><span id="page-425-10"></span><span id="page-425-9"></span><span id="page-425-8"></span><span id="page-425-7"></span>This little book links the future of the world to the people of Israel. Looking back to the promises made to Abraham (7:20), Micah also looks forward to a time in which the temple and the King of Israel will dominate the world and produce everlasting shalom (4:1–4; 5:2–3). There will not be peace until the King born in Bethlehem rules to the ends of the earth (5:1–5a). But this will not occur until the nation goes through major upheavals, turmoil, and judgment.

In some ways this little collection of oracles is a miniversion of the much larger collection of oracles in the book of Isaiah. It is almost as if Micah's little book were a theological sketch of his more famous contemporary. There are many similar themes, and in particular one oracle is presented virtually verbatim in each book: Micah 4:1–4 and Isaiah 2:1–4.

### <span id="page-426-2"></span>*Title and Author*

The title of the book comes from the name of its author, Micah (*mikah*) of Moresheth. He is described as coming from Moresheth likely because he seems to have exercised his prophetic role in a different location, most likely Jerusalem. His name was a short, popular name for boys in ancient Judah,1 but its meaning carried heavy theological freight, for it is a rhetorical question—"Who is like Yahweh?" As such, it is an exclamation of praise, "an expression of adoration and wonder at the incomparable God of Israel."2 Micah's name appears only at the beginning of his oracles, in the superscription, or title, of the book (1:1), but there is a pun on his name near the end of the book, which functions to provide a fitting conclusion: "Who is a God like you [*mi 'el kamoka*], pardoning iniquity . . . ?" (7:18).

<span id="page-426-8"></span><span id="page-426-4"></span><span id="page-426-3"></span>While the opening verse identifies Micah as the human source of the words of this book (1:1), it is clear that he is only the messenger of words that come from God. Many scholars assume that less than half of the words that follow the title are those of Micah of Moresheth (usually chs. 1–3), but the book makes no such distinction. All of the words that follow should be viewed as coming from Micah. Whether Micah himself physically wrote down the words is debatable, as at least some prophets had scribes who recorded their words (Jeremiah 36). What is clear from the superscription, however, is that the collection of speeches in this book originates from Micah of Moresheth.

<span id="page-426-7"></span><span id="page-426-6"></span><span id="page-426-5"></span>Some scholars reject Micah's authorship of many of the oracles in the book bearing his name due to their belief in the incompatibility of a message of judgment and salvation in the same historical period. Consequently, the oracles of judgment in the first part of the book (Mic. 1:2–2:11; 3:1–12) are viewed by such scholars as authentic, while the salvation oracles in the latter half of the book (chs. 4–5; 7:8–20) are believed to be from a later hand that sought to temper that judgment. But such a belief imposes categories of consistency on an ancient prophet that would not be sustainable even for speakers in our own time. Over a course of a few decades, public speakers could give many different types of speeches in many different changing contexts.

#### *Date and Occasion*

In terms of historical context, Micah's prophecies are dated rather precisely to the reigns of three kings of Judah: Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). Nowhere in his

<span id="page-426-0"></span><sup>1</sup> A longer form had twice as many syllables: Micaiah (*mikayahu*). Eleven other people had the name Micah or a variation of it in biblical times (cf. Judg. 17:1; 1 Kings. 22:8; 1 Chron. 5:5; 8:34; 9:40; 23:20; 2 Chron. 34:20; Neh. 10:11; 11:17; 12:35; Jer. 36:11).

<span id="page-426-1"></span><sup>2</sup> James Luther Mays, *Micah: A Commentary* (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1976), 1.

recorded speeches does Micah mention any of these kings—there may be an allusion here or there,3 but no explicit mention is made of them. Jotham was a co-regent with his father, Uzziah, for a number of years before assuming sole kingship around 742 BC and reigning until 735. He was succeeded by his son Ahaz, who ruled for twenty years, until 715, and he in turn was followed by Hezekiah, who assumed leadership for twenty-eight years, until 687. This leaves us with a maximum period of fifty-five years for Micah's prophetic activity (if he started at the beginning of Jotham's reign and stopped at the end of Hezekiah's) and a minimum of just over 20 (if he started at the end of Jotham's reign and stopped at the beginning of Hezekiah's). But since it is known from other sources that Micah predicted the destruction of the temple during the crisis of Sennacherib in 701 BC (Jer. 26:18–19), and since the devastation of southwest Judah described in Micah 1:8–16 most likely took place during this historical period, the minimum period of Micah's prophetic activity would be about thirty-five years (from the end of Jotham's reign to the crisis of 701 BC).4 While one cannot achieve certainty in such historical matters, details of many of the oracles suggest that the period before and leading up to 701 BC is the most suitable historical context for the present collection of oracles.

<span id="page-427-3"></span><span id="page-427-2"></span><span id="page-427-1"></span><span id="page-427-0"></span>The main body of oracles were originally proclaimed orally and then written down after the events, either by Micah or by a scribe. That Micah could have been involved in writing his oracles may be suggested by a statement in 3:1, "And I said," which introduces an oracle of judgment. But Micah probably did not write the book's superscription, which refers to him in the third person (1:1); he also may not have been involved in the final arrangement of his speeches, since the third-person superscription is echoed by the conclusion (7:18). The summative nature of the final conclusion to the book (7:8–20) also suggests more of a literary composition and may point to an editor's involvement.

### <span id="page-427-7"></span><span id="page-427-6"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-427-4"></span>As with most of the prophets, the speeches in Micah were probably spoken before they were transmitted in writing and included in a literary collection. Only a few parts of the book itself seem to have a literary origin, such as the book's superscription (1:1), which functions as the initial part of the prophet's biography and provides information about the author, his location, authority, and historical period, and the recipients of his messages (cf. 3:1a). Twenty to thirty independent speeches can be identified in the book, and each of these would have had a specific social and historical context, which can no longer be precisely identified.5 The original oral nature of these speeches is quite clear. Sudden transitions in theme, choppy sentence structure, switch in person and number of verb forms, use of imperatives

<span id="page-427-5"></span><sup>3</sup> In 4:9, Hezekiah's ability to help his people is perhaps being satirically questioned; and 5:1 may refer to Hezekiah during the time of the Assyrian siege in 701 BC (cf. comments on 4:9; 5:1)

<sup>4</sup> Calvin argues plausibly for a period of about thirty years, but he is not dogmatic; *Commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets* (Charleston, SC: BiblioLife, 2010), 151.

and oral interjections, grammatical incongruities, semantic ambiguities, and colloquialisms—all of these indicate the original nature of the oral discourse. In other words, the written form of these speeches largely preserves their original oral qualities.6 Discourse first composed in written form has more thematic coherence, logical structure, consistent grammar, and extensive vocabulary to compensate for the loss of spoken features such as tone, gesture, stress, and emphasis.7

<span id="page-428-13"></span><span id="page-428-7"></span><span id="page-428-4"></span><span id="page-428-2"></span>Micah used a variety of genres to communicate his message: lament (1:8–16; 2:1–5; 7:1–6), judgment speech (3:1–4, 5–8, 9–12; 6:9–16), salvation oracle (2:12–13; 4:1–5), disputation (2:6–11), covenant lawsuit (6:1–5), entrance liturgy (6:6–7), futility curse (6:14–15), and hymn (7:18–20).8 These genres each represent a different type of speech common in ancient Israel. Just as it is important to know in one's own language the genre of speech being used in order to understand what is being said, it is important to understand the genre of speech from another language and another time in order to facilitate communication. For example, puns in English are often humorous, showing wit and cleverness. But puns as used by ancient Israelites are much more serious and profound, connecting places and people with events, and thus they can be either auspicious or ominous (1:8–16).

<span id="page-428-6"></span><span id="page-428-5"></span>Micah is rich in such wordplays and linguistic associations, and they abound throughout the text. For example, in 2:2 we read that greedy landowners covet and seize fields (*sadot*), while in 2:4 we read that these wicked men will be certainly destroyed (*sadod nesaddunu*). In another example, a salvation oracle concludes with an announcement of a future King going before the *head* of the people in leading them out of captivity (2:13). The next oracle returns to the present and condemns the *heads* of Jacob (i.e., the present leaders) for their injustice (3:1).

### <span id="page-428-9"></span><span id="page-428-8"></span>*Theology of Micah*

<span id="page-428-11"></span><span id="page-428-3"></span><span id="page-428-1"></span><span id="page-428-0"></span>Throughout the collection of Micah's speeches, the audience of Micah—whether ancient or modern—learns a great deal about God. He is a God who takes his covenant with his people seriously (1:5), who will brook no rivals to his transcendence (1:6–7), and who controls the nations—even the dreaded Assyrian army (1:6–16). Yet he is also concerned with the plight of the "little people" and their exploitation at the hands of the covetous rich (2:1–3, 8–9; 3:1–3), with truth-telling (2:6–11; 3:5–8), with a just society and the importance of human rights (6:6–8), with the terrible blight of war in the world (4:1–5), and with what it means to be human (6:6–8). In addition, this God is not a dispassionate, distant figure but rather one who passionately cares for the victims of oppression and is angry with their oppressors—hence the passionate language of Micah on behalf of victims and against their victimizers (2:1–5, 6–11; 3:1–12). Moreover, God is exasperated with his people when they do not respond to his grace (6:3). This is surely a God like no

<span id="page-428-12"></span><span id="page-428-10"></span><sup>6</sup> Note a similar point made for Mark's Gospel: "[It] is in no way the smooth product of a skilled author seated at his desk, but has all the vividness and peculiar patterns of speech that one finds in actual transcripts of live speeches" (David Alan Black, *Why Four Gospels: The Historical Origins of the Gospels*, 2nd ed. [Gonzalez, FL: Energion, 2010], 67).

<span id="page-429-4"></span>other, a transcendent One—"high and lifted up" (cf. Isa. 6:1) but also concerned with matters of everyday reality such as fairness and equity, poverty and wealth, and the poor and helpless.

<span id="page-429-12"></span><span id="page-429-8"></span><span id="page-429-7"></span>The God of the book of Micah is the One before whom creation dissolves when he arrives to judge and to save (Mic. 1:3–4). Importantly, he is a God of both justice and mercy, and these are not pitted against each other, as they sometimes are in popular theology (2:1–5, 12–13). This is a God who commands people to seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with him (6:8). In other words, concern for the right ordering of society stems from a love for mercy (ESV "kindness"), which comes from walking in the ways of the Lord's law. The Lord is the one who is omnipotent and full of mercy (7:18–20). The word for mercy (*hesed* ) is a rich Hebrew word that cannot be defined precisely in English. It is often translated as "mercy," "fidelity," "loyalty," "covenant love," etc. God delights in *hesed*; it is central to who he is. The word indicates someone who will respond to the needs of others by helping them. It is often connected with duty, but need not be.9 One's helplessness evokes "mercy," the desire to help, in another's heart. This quality is deep within the heart of God. It makes him faithful to his covenant and results in forgiveness of sin and the final conquest of all evil that would separate him from his people (7:19–20).

## <span id="page-429-13"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-429-14"></span><span id="page-429-10"></span><span id="page-429-9"></span>Micah is very much aware of the covenants of God with his people and the essential narrative of Israel's early history: the covenant with Abraham (7:20), the exodus (6:4), Sinai (2:2, 7b; 3:1), the wilderness wanderings (6:5a), and the conquest (4:13; 6:5b). Micah believes that God's purposes in history will finally triumph. This is based on two essential points: the elevation of the temple in Zion (4:1–5) and the elevation of a King (5:2–5a). Both will result in the triumph of a new world order that will lead to Yahweh's rule over the entire earth. Both of these emphases develop central themes in the biblical storyline.

<span id="page-429-11"></span><span id="page-429-2"></span><span id="page-429-1"></span><span id="page-429-0"></span>The centrality of the temple for Israel and the world is an important biblical theme. Humans were banished from sacred space—from the garden temple in Eden (Genesis 2–3). Autonomous humans sought to recapture this blessing on their own by building the Tower of Babel (Gen. 11:1–9), but God judged this project and instead called out a special people through whom this blessing would come (Gen. 12:1–3). Eventually the place of this blessing was located in Jerusalem, Mount Zion. The Psalms describe the centrality of Zion as the locale of God's blessing (Psalms 46–48). It will eventually be elevated to the highest place (Mic. 4:1; cf. Ezekiel 40; Zech. 14:8), and from it will flow a life-giving stream that will become a mighty river and bring life to trees, which in turn produce leaves that bring healing (Ezek. 47:12).

This is the so-called *protoeuangelion*—the "first [*proto*] gospel [*euangelion*]." The expectation of such a figure can be traced throughout the Scriptures (e.g., Gen. 49:8–12; Num. 24:15–19; 1 Sam. 2:10) and is finally linked to a covenant made with David, who would have a son who would someday rule the world, bringing everlasting peace and justice (2 Samuel 7; Psalms 2; 72; 89). Micah is distinctive in that he locates the birthplace of this King not in Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, but, appropriately, in David's hometown, Bethlehem (Mic. 5:2; cf. 1 Sam. 16:1–13). The birth of this "Messiah" will take place after a long gestation period (Mic. 5:3), and it will result in a King whose reconstituted remnant of Israel will be like dew to the nations (5:7) and a lion to their enemies (5:8–9); he himself will bring an end to all war (5:10–11).

Jesus is regarded as David's greater Son (Matt. 21:9) who brings the blessings of forgiveness and healing to the nations (Luke 24:46–47). His temple no longer consists in an actual building made of literal stones but is composed of living stones (believers) and inhabited by God's Holy Spirit (1 Pet. 2:5). They are elevated on a hill, shining their light to all the world and sending to the nations the good news of forgiveness and reconciliation (Matt. 5:14–16). Those who hear the good news can respond with faith and repentance and discover the ways of peace. In fact, this is the name of the Messiah in Micah: "their peace" (Mic. 5:5a), for he breaks down the dividing walls between nations, races, genders, and social classes (Eph. 2:12–17) and brings an end to war (Mic. 4:1–5). He is the one through whose atoning death sin has been conquered (7:19).

## <span id="page-430-10"></span><span id="page-430-7"></span><span id="page-430-5"></span>*Preaching from Micah*

This book is a rich treasure trove for ministers of the Christian church. First, its depiction of a God of absolute and utter transcendence should be a reminder to all of the need for humility and repentance. As sinful people, we are tempted to domesticate God, to use him for a political party, a particular group, a philosophy, a program. This was true in pre–World War II Germany. The German Christian movement essentially used Christianity to shore up the Nazi movement, and the rest of this sad story is history.10 It was also true in Micah's day, when the themes of election and temple became excuses for the nation to sin without consequence and guaranteed them a supposed "eternal security." But Micah's God will not be domesticated by any program or philosophy or culture. Even the most sacred institution stands under God's judgment and will be destroyed if it loses its concern for justice and mercy (3:12).

<span id="page-430-4"></span>Today there are many ministers who preach what people want to hear, not what they need to hear. The temptation is to cave in to popular sentiments, but the

<sup>10</sup> Peter Matheson, *The Third Reich and the Christian Churches* (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, 1981).

preacher must make known to a culture and people their true diagnosis if there is to be any cure. As the French Huguenot pastor Jean Daillé remarked, "Ministers are not cooks but physicians, and therefore should study not to delight the palate but to recover the patient." In contrast to the false prophets and prosperity preachers of his day, Micah was empowered by the Holy Spirit to speak boldly of the need for justice and righteousness and to declare to Jacob his sin and to Israel his transgression (3:8). When ministers become popular rather than faithful, they have probably lost their calling and will eventually lose their inspiration (3:7).

<span id="page-431-4"></span><span id="page-431-3"></span><span id="page-431-2"></span>Finally, the book is a reminder of the importance of living a life of justice, mercy, and relationship with God. In a masterful reminder of the importance of what true worship means, Micah tells his audience that worship is not about ritual or one-off performances of dedication to God, but about a *life* of dedication (6:6–8). This is especially important in cultures where Christianity is regarded as "fire insurance," with no call on a person's life after he or she makes a commitment to Christ. Such a view is a travesty of biblical faith. In the words of A. W. Tozer, "God saves us to and not just from!" In other words, the purpose of salvation is to save not only from judgment but also for a life of holiness and justice. This is fully in line with the teaching of the NT; Jesus himself said, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments" (John 14:15).

### <span id="page-431-5"></span>*Interpretive Challenges*

Particular interpretive challenges in Micah occur in several places:

<span id="page-431-0"></span>1. The text in 1:9–15, which lists cities and uses wordplays on their names, is a notorious passage riddled with text-critical difficulties. Sometimes the Septuagint identifies a town while the Hebrew text does not. Moreover, some of the towns have not been identified, occurring only here in the OT. Nevertheless, the general sense of the text is clear: a number of cities, with Jerusalem at the center, are described as an ancient "hit list" of towns in southwest Judah that God will judge. Their names are connected to their fates, to add an ominous note of doom.

<span id="page-431-1"></span>2. It is difficult to detect the speakers in 2:6–7. In this text Micah is engaged in a dispute with false prophets who are telling him to cease and desist from prophesying judgment against Judah. The ESV understands the verses as follows:

"Do not preach"—thus they preach— "one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us." Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Has the Lord grown impatient? Are these his deeds? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?

This is a logical way to understand this text, with the words provided in quotation marks (which are not included in the Hebrew text) viewed as the words of the false

prophets. But another reading of the Hebrew suggests that, after the command to stop his preaching,

Do not preach.

Micah describes the false prophets:

 They will not preach about these things; he [the Lord] will not remove disgraces [or: disgraces will not be removed].

The false prophets probably then continue with three rhetorical questions that expect a negative answer and criticize Micah's preaching:

 Should this be said, O House of Jacob? Has the Lord grown impatient? Are these his deeds?"

Micah then responds with a word of the Lord, emphasizing the stipulations of the covenant. This time God's rhetorical question assumes a positive answer:

 Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?

The rest of the speech expands on these words, which show that the people of Judah are not walking uprightly.

Thus, while it is not completely clear who is speaking at times in the text, the general sense is clear: Micah is defending his preaching in a dispute with false prophets about judgment.

<span id="page-432-3"></span><span id="page-432-2"></span><span id="page-432-1"></span><span id="page-432-0"></span>3. Another text posing an interpretive challenge is 2:12–13, which seems to interrupt preaching of judgment with a salvation oracle concerning return from exile, which is in the distant future. A significant number of interpreters see this text as a continuation of judgment speeches, understanding it in an ironic sense: the people gathered in Jerusalem like sheep, in fear of the Assyrian armies, will be led into exile by God out of the land, which has become defiled. This interpretation has a venerable pedigree going back to John Calvin. Other recent interpreters have tended to see this as a salvation oracle by the false prophets; they understand this prophecy to speak of God's salvation for the people in light of the Assyrian invasion, and thus Micah continues quoting the false prophets, which again he will contradict in 3:1 ("But *I* said"). Both of these interpretations attempt to make the passage fit into the context of judgment, but if the structure of the book is understood as judgment followed by salvation in each of its three sections (1:2–2:11 vs. 2:12–13; 3:1–12 vs. 4:1–5:15; 6:1–7:7 vs. 7:8–20), there is no problem. In 1:16; 2:3–5, 10–11, an exile is predicted, but 2:12–13 is the final word to that exile: God will save his people and bring them back home. Thus there need not be any extraordinary exegetical endeavors that seek to conform the passage to its literary context.

## MICAH 1:1

1 The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

#### *Comment*

1:1 This superscription of the book functions as a title, providing the source of the message, its messenger, the time the message was delivered, and its first audience. The phrase "the word of the Lord that came to" is clearly a formula marking this book as a collection of prophetic messages. In other words, the words that follow are not merely human words; they have their ultimate origin in Israel's covenant God, Yahweh. They are collectively known as *his* word. "Micah of Moresheth" identifies the one to whom God's word comes. His name means "Who is like Yahweh?" (cf. Introduction: Author), and he lived in Moresheth, located in the hill country of southwest Judah, near the Philistine city of Gath (thus the village is sometimes known as Moresheth-gath; cf. v. 14). Moresheth is likely to be identified with modern Tell-el Judeideh, about 6 miles (10 km) southeast of Gath and about the same distance northeast of Lachish.11 This would situate the village about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Jerusalem. There is an ancient line of interpretation identifying Moresheth with nearby Mareshah,12 but the two are distinguished in Micah 1 (vv. 1, 14, 15).

<span id="page-435-3"></span><span id="page-435-2"></span>The time in which the message was delivered was during the successive reigns of three kings of Judah: Jotham (742–735 BC), Ahaz (735–715), and Hezekiah (715–687). Many of the oracles, however, seem to suggest that the period before and leading up to 701 BC is the most suitable historical context for the present collection of oracles (cf. Introduction: Date and Occasion).

The addressees of the messages were "Samaria and Jerusalem," the capital cities of the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah,

<sup>11</sup> Eusebius the historian identifies it east of Eleutheropolis (*Onomasticon* 716). The ancient Medeba Map, in the same general location, has a citation of "Morashti, from which the prophet Micah came." Jerome identified it with Eleutheropolis, Beit Jibrin. See further Philip J. King, *Amos, Hosea, Micah — An Archaeological Commentary* (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1988), 60.

<span id="page-435-0"></span><sup>12</sup> Cf., e.g., the Targum on Micah 1:1; Joshua 15:44.

<span id="page-436-1"></span>respectively. These capital cities represent their respective nations. The order of the northern kingdom first, followed by the southern kingdom, suggests the order of the arrangement of the oracles to follow in the first section (1:2–2:13). The first oracle concerns Samaria and the northern kingdom (1:2–7), while the rest deal with Jerusalem and Judah (1:8–2:13).

### OVERVIEW OF

## MICAH 1:2–2:13

<span id="page-436-0"></span>This is the first of the three major sections of Micah. It starts with judgment and ends with deliverance. As it begins, the nations are called to hear the judgment of God against his people in Samaria and Jerusalem so that they might be aware that God is the King and Judge of the universe (1:2). If he will judge his own people for their sin, then surely he will judge the rest of the earth as well. The first vision of God is a breathtaking description of his emergence from his throne room in heaven in order to descend to the heights of the earth. The mountains and valleys dissolve before him (1:3–4).

<span id="page-436-5"></span><span id="page-436-4"></span><span id="page-436-3"></span><span id="page-436-2"></span>The prophet first announces judgment on Samaria (1:6–7) before engaging in a lament throughout southwest Judah over the coming judgment of Judah and Jerusalem (1:8–16). This will result in the capital city of Judah lamenting for its children's exile (1:16). Chapter 2 continues this section by providing the reasons for the judgment of Judah: widespread covetousness on the part of the wealthy, which has led to the expropriation of the land of poor farmers and the driving of these poor farmers out of house and home (2:1–5).

<span id="page-436-9"></span><span id="page-436-8"></span><span id="page-436-7"></span><span id="page-436-6"></span>Micah's message of judgment is countered by false prophets who cannot imagine such a message from a loving God (2:6–7). Micah parries these theological objections by reminding his opponents of the stipulations of the covenant and by attacking their prosperity gospel (2:8–11). Finally, Micah adds that the coming exile will not be the last word of Yahweh. The One before whom the mountains dissolve will break his people out of their exilic prison and lead them back home (2:12–13).

## MICAH 1:2–7

<span id="page-437-0"></span>**<sup>2</sup>** Hear, you peoples, all of you;*<sup>1</sup>* pay attention, O earth, and all that is in it, and let the Lord God be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. **<sup>3</sup>** For behold, the Lord is coming out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. **<sup>4</sup>** And the mountains will melt under him, and the valleys will split open, like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a steep place. **<sup>5</sup>** All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? **<sup>6</sup>** Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards, and I will pour down her stones into the valley and uncover her foundations. **<sup>7</sup>** All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste, for from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them, and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return.

1Hebrew *all of them*

### *Section Overview*

The first oracle of Micah strategically sets the scene for the rest of the book. It is addressed to all the nations as they are given insight into what will happen when God comes to the earth to claim ownership and exercise rule. This is the most awesome vision of God's transcendence in the collection, and thus it was not accidentally chosen to begin the sequence of speeches the book contains. The image is of God as a divine King leaving his throne room and descending to earth to walk its heights. The mountains melt like wax before a fire, and the valleys dissolve like water rushing down a slope. Nothing can stand before such awesome transcendence.

The reason for such a remarkable visitation to earth is the moral corruption of God's people, exemplified by the cities of Samaria and Jerusalem. Samaria's coming <span id="page-438-6"></span>judgment is then announced as its foundations are razed and it becomes a field for vineyards. This is because of its rampant idolatry, which is linked to spiritual prostitution. The judgment of Samaria is the first example of a principal theme in Micah: the punishment equals the crime (cf. 2:3–5, 10; 3:4, 5–7, 12).13 Just as the people of Samaria purchased idols from the fees of prostitution, so will foreign invaders use the plunder of the city to pay for sex with prostitutes associated with religious shrines when they return home (1:7).

## *Comment*

1:2–4 This opening speech of the prophet appropriately addresses the nations outside of Israel—all of them, and this will become a major theme of the book. Micah's God is not a national, tribal deity; he is the God of the universe. He will not be satisfied until the whole world knows him and his ways and his rule extends to the ends of the earth (4:1–4; 5:3; 7:11).

<span id="page-438-7"></span><span id="page-438-1"></span>God declares that he will be a "witness" against the nations. Some scholars suggest that this means he will simply witness among or alongside them, testifying against the sins of his people that will shortly be announced; however, the grammar suggests that his witness is *against* them rather than *among* them. The nations are to know not only that the Lord will judge his people (1:1) but also that he will judge *them*. And thus they are to listen and pay attention. The awesomeness of God is further described in that he is the "Lord God" (v. 2), the only time this divine epithet, stressing divine sovereignty, is used in the book. Further, he is in his holy temple, on the royal throne of the universe. This is likely not a reference to the earthly temple in Jerusalem; the universal vision and the later descent to the heights of the earth (v. 3) suggests this is God's heavenly palace.

<span id="page-438-4"></span><span id="page-438-2"></span>The original setting of this text may well have been where foreign dignitaries were being hosted near the royal palace in Samaria, or somewhere in Jerusalem where residents of the northern kingdom of Israel and other nations may have been present. Israelites and/or the citizens of Judah may have been applauding Micah's speech against the nations. Whatever the setting may have been, the words that follow set a stunning vision before their eyes: "Behold, the Lord is coming out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth"

<span id="page-438-0"></span><sup>13</sup> This is known as the *lex talionis* principle; it is exemplified in the biblical laws stating that a penalty must equal the crime, "eye for eye, tooth for tooth" (Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20).

<span id="page-439-1"></span>(v. 3). The Hebrew word for "behold" (*hinneh*) places the audience right in the scene as they watch Yahweh emerge from the heavenly throne room and see him descend to tread upon the high places of the world. The word for "high places" (*bamot*) can often signify pagan shrines built on the highest points of cities or towns, so there is probably a double entendre here, in which both the high mountains and pagan idolatry are signified.

<span id="page-439-2"></span>Verse 4 shows the catastrophic consequence of God's coming to the earth: creation essentially disintegrates before him. The divine foot descends to the high places of the earth, the mountains, which melt like wax before the fire; the valleys break up and flow like water down a slope. This is clearly a picture of judgment. The beginning of Nahum includes a similar theophany that clarifies the context:

 The mountains quake before him; the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who dwell in it.

 Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken into pieces by him. (Nah. 1:5–6)

<span id="page-439-5"></span>The judgment theme is shown further in the Psalms, where Yahweh enters into dispute with his people:

 Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people. (Ps. 50:3–4)

<span id="page-439-0"></span>Such a vision of creation rocking and reeling because of an angry God would cause the audience to rock and reel as well. From an Israelite perspective, there may have been applause: those nations are finally going to get their due.

<span id="page-439-3"></span>And this divine fury demands an explanation. It is not long in coming.

<span id="page-439-4"></span>1:5–7 Verse 5 states the reason for this entrance of divine fury into creation. Unlike the deities of the ancient world, Yahweh is not capricious. As Lord of the universe, he is passionate about justice and will intervene if necessary in order to maintain order and justice. But this verse shows that if the Israelites have been celebrating the coming judgment of the nations, they will now experience quite a shock: "All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel." "Transgression" is a word indicating rebellion, often used in political contexts to refer to revolt. "Sin" signifies primarily a failure to meet a standard. "Jacob" was the father of the twelve Israelite tribes, and "Israel" was his new name following

his spiritual transformation. With the use of these two terms Micah is showing at the outset that he is an obedient prophet, as later he defines the calling of a true prophet: "to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin" (3:8).

<span id="page-440-5"></span><span id="page-440-1"></span>But Micah continues by adding more reasons for the intervention of God into history, personifying these transgression and sins. The Hebrew of 1:5b can be read more literally as, "Who is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria [the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel]? And who are the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem [the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah]?" The capital cities of both nations are the culprits; they have led the people, probably through their political influence, into wholesale idolatry. This is particularly clear for Judah, whose capital city is described as a network of high places (pagan shrines). Thus the sins of the northern and southern kingdoms are their idolatrous capital cities, whose idolatrous ways have spread like a contagious disease to the rest of their nations.

<span id="page-440-3"></span><span id="page-440-2"></span><span id="page-440-0"></span>Idolatry is the indictment, and the capital city of Samaria is the first culprit mentioned; the verdict quickly follows in verses 6–7. Samaria will be razed to the ground, left as a heap of ruins, good for nothing but agriculture. Her stones will be poured into the valley (v. 6c), just as the valleys cracked up and were poured out like water rushing down a slope in the introductory theophany (v. 4d). The emphasis on the comprehensive destruction of idolatry is clear in verse 7, as three times the word "all" is mentioned for its elimination. God is depicted here as the ultimate iconoclast, as the idols are smashed or burned up.

<span id="page-440-4"></span>Verse 7 introduces a characteristic theme in Micah: punishment fitting the crime. Samaria gathered its temple gifts from prostitution associated in some way with their idolatrous worship, and will be judged for doing so, as an invading army (Assyria) will destroy Samaria's idols, loot the temple gifts, and then use them like currency for their own prostitution associated with their own idolatry back home. God's hatred of his people's sin is so deep that he will not hesitate to use idolatrous nations to judge his idolatrous people.

## *Response*

This first oracle clearly shows the Lord's concern for the order of his creation, and this has relevance for everyone. It describes Yahweh as the universal Judge and sovereign King who is active in his universe and will finally act in the face of sin. The awesome transcendence of this God before whom creation dissolves when he appears is also a reminder that God is the Creator, far larger than our feeble attempts to understand him. The contemporary God of many believers is domesticated by various theologies of immanence, where God is brought down to a human level, as a "buddy" or a benign grandfather, to control and tame. But in this opening oracle the biblical God of Micah reminds us of his transcendence.

<span id="page-440-6"></span>Second, this oracle reminds us that God hates idolatry. Idolatry is finally a lie, an attempt to domesticate the transcendence of God, to control the divine. It substitutes a lie for the truth of God and thus, as Paul declares, worships the creature rather than the Creator (Rom. 1:25). God's passion for truth will not tolerate the distorting lie of idolatry and its corrupting consequences. Thus he shows himself to be the ultimate iconoclast in the judgment of Samaria. All idols will someday be smashed, whether in 722 BC or AD 2000. Many in the contemporary age think they are not religious, but all people everywhere worship something, whether images of stone or metal, or objects of wealth and health, or objects of status or power. And yet all such idols will one day come to an end: wealth can be wiped out in an instant; death and sickness come to the fittest of people; power is as fleeting as the morning mist; today's celebrities are anonymous tomorrow; today's superpowers will be impotent tomorrow. Thus believers must be alert to put their trust always in God.

<span id="page-441-1"></span>When John the Baptist prepared the way for the Messiah, he expected a fiery apocalypse in which everything idolatrous would be burned up in the coming fires of judgment, much as Samaria was judged (Matt. 3:7–12). He solemnly urged people to flee from the coming wrath. What he failed to consider was the mystery of the end. The Messiah would first come in suffering and humiliation, identifying with sinners and taking on himself the curse of judgment for his people's sin and idolatry. This would give them the opportunity to place their faith in him and thus worship and serve the Creator rather than the creature. Idolatry—false images of God—would be replaced by people reflecting the true image of God in holiness and love. Thus the exalted One became the humble One, revealing the ultimate heart of God.

<span id="page-441-2"></span>The extent to which God would go in sending his Son reveals both the depths of the evils of idolatry and the heights of God's love for human beings. But there should be no mistake: Just as the Messiah came first in incredible humility and love to save and to heal, he will come again to reveal the final folly of all idolatry. It is this second event that occupied the Baptist's thoughts. Then the judgment of Samaria predicted by Micah will be universalized. In the meantime, however, there is opportunity for believers living between the two comings to marvel in amazement at Jesus' first coming and to seize the moment to live lives of holiness and godliness as they await his second coming (2 Pet. 3:11–12).

## *Section Overview*

The second oracle of Micah is closely linked to the first, although it was probably separated in time by decades. The first oracle announced the destruction of Samaria in 722 BC by the Assyrians; this second oracle warns of the imminent demise of Judah in 701, again at the hands of the Assyrian army. The first oracle had "unfinished business" in that it indicated how Judah and Jerusalem were implicated in idolatry but only Samaria was judged. Now this business is addressed as judgment comes to Judah.

The prophet uses a lament genre to describe his own frantic reaction to the prospect of judgment. He goes barefoot and naked through the countryside of southwest Judah announcing the coming doom. Twelve towns and cities are mentioned, with the seventh one being the centerpiece: Jerusalem. The text is a type <span id="page-443-3"></span>of geographical "hit list," as it targets for judgment a sequence of towns in Judah. There are major difficulties in the identification of these towns, and the Hebrew text is difficult to understand in places. But the general theme is impossible to miss. Micah begins by lamenting for the nation as he walks through the land, crying wildly like an animal (1:8–9). The towns and cities on the divine "hit list" are then mentioned (vv. 10–15), and finally Jerusalem is commanded to wail and mourn for the loss of her youth as her people are led into exile (v. 16).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-443-2"></span><span id="page-443-1"></span>1:8–9 "For this" refers back to the judgment of Samaria. It leads the prophet to engage in typical mourning rites (going barefoot and not wearing an outer garment; 2 Sam. 15:30; Isa. 20:2–3) and to wail and weep uncontrollably, making noises like jackals and ostriches,14 wild animals of the desert often paired in contexts of desolation and ruin (Isa. 34:13; Jer. 50:39). Samaria's judgment came because of her "wound" (lit., "wounds/blows"), a reference to her idolatry, which was so deep and entrenched that it was like an "incurable" disease. To make matters worse, the idolatry has spread to Judah, which is all the more reason for the prophet to mourn. The idolatry and judgment have moved from the capital city of the northern kingdom to the capital city of the southern kingdom and have "reached"—a word associated elsewhere with plague or disease—its very gate. The Hebrew poetry intensifies the movement, finally zeroing in on the city of Jerusalem:

 It has spread *to Judah*. It has reached the *very gate of my people*, *to Jerusalem itself*. (AT)

1:10–15 The towns are each apparently chosen for their ominous sounding names, which are linked in some way to the coming judgment. The list begins with a notorious statement sounding the note of Judah's defeat. "Tell it not in Gath" were the same words David used to memorialize forever the deaths of Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa, as well as the fall of Israel itself (2 Sam. 1:20). Micah now uses these same ominous words to introduce a list of cities that were to become the targets of God's judgment.

<span id="page-443-0"></span>The list is full of wordplays in Hebrew that often underscore the ominous nature of what is to happen. The people of Beth-le-aphrah are told to roll in the <span id="page-444-6"></span><span id="page-444-5"></span><span id="page-444-0"></span>dust, as the name of their town means "house of dust." Rolling in the dust was a sign of lament, as the act indicated terrific grief, enacted symbolically as a type of death by returning to the dust (cf. Gen. 2:7; 3:19; Josh. 7:6; Job 2:8). Similarly, the name Shaphir (Mic. 1:11a) means "brilliance" or "beauty," but its inhabitants are told to leave in "nakedness and shame," suggesting the way in which prisoners of war were escorted from captured villages. Zaanan (v. 11b) means "exit" and was probably situated so as to provide an exit from the southwestern hills of Judah to the coastal plain and vice versa. For Micah, though, the people of Zaanan will not be able to exit in the impending judgment. Beth-ezel (v. 11c) suggests a nearby town (that is therefore able to help), but it will not be able to provide any support ("standing place"), for it will be in mourning.

<span id="page-444-9"></span><span id="page-444-8"></span><span id="page-444-7"></span>Maroth's name (1:12a) means "bitterness," and, true to its name, its plight is most bitter as it awaits help that will never come. Jerusalem, the City of Peace, will experience disaster (v. 12b). Lachish is known as the place where sin began in the nation, and this is probably due to its being a strong military fortress, in which its people trusted power rather than God (v. 13). Lachish had trusted in harnessing its horses to chariots, its military power; now Lachish (*lakish*) is told to "harness the steeds [*rekesh*] to the chariots" for a battle it will not win.

<span id="page-444-11"></span><span id="page-444-10"></span>Moresheth-gath (1:14a), Micah's hometown, suggests with its name the place of "possession," but it will be given new "possessions" as it heads into exile—most likely ropes and chains. Achzib sounds like the word meaning "lie," and any help it might give to the royal house will prove an illusion. Mareshah sounds like the word for "conqueror," but it will prove to be the conquered, not the conqueror. Finally, the last city noted, Adullam (v. 15b), though not a wordplay, is a reminder of where David hid from Saul in caves when he was being pursued (1 Samuel 22). It is now mentioned as a place where the nobility of the nation, the glory of Israel, i.e., the royal house, will seek to hide from the coming judgment.

<span id="page-444-13"></span><span id="page-444-12"></span><span id="page-444-2"></span>1:16 The city of Jerusalem is viewed here as a mother of children who are going into exile. She is urged to shave her hair and make herself bald like an eagle.

<span id="page-444-4"></span><span id="page-444-1"></span>Such shaving, as an act of intense mourning, in some ways identified the mourner with the victims being lamented. It indicated pain so extreme that the body was in a sense disfigured (Jer. 41:4–5), and it perhaps symbolized a "living death." Possibly this is why Israelites were forbidden to shave certain parts of their heads, and mutilation (gashing) was proscribed as well (cf. Deut. 14:1). Such practices may have indicated a loss of hope in the God of life. Life was not to be defined by death. Since shaving in general was an act of intense mourning (Isa. 22:12), the command to do so here makes clear that the holy city, Jerusalem, will be in extreme agony over the loss of her children.

## <span id="page-444-3"></span>*Response*

Micah lamented the fate of his country, for it had been infected by the idolatry of the northern kingdom of Israel. He was far more interested in the spiritual health of the nation than its political or economic health. Idolatry, a crime finally against God, had resulted in Judah's living in a world of lies, trusting in its beauty and power instead of the living God. This was truly a lamentable condition. How many contemporary believers lament for the spiritual condition of their nation? How many pastors grieve over the tepid spiritual state of their congregations? The psalmist says, "My eyes shed streams of tears, because people do not keep your law" (Ps. 119:136).

<span id="page-445-0"></span>Thus we are reminded of the deep passion of Micah. He cares. He has seen the judgment and is stricken almost with incoherence. This may explain the grammatical disorder in some of the sentences. Elie Wiesel describes a person named Moishe the Beadle, who escaped from a German extermination squad and returned to his hometown to warn his neighbors about the horrific dangers that awaited them. People all thought he was crazy when he would shout in the synagogue, seeking to alert everyone to the imminent danger: "Jews, listen to me. That's all I ask of you! No money. No pity. Just listen to me!"15 Perhaps Christian pastors might act a bit more like Micah and Moishe the Beadle. The apostle Paul once remarked, when mentioning the final judgment, "Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others" (2 Cor. 5:11).

<span id="page-445-3"></span>Archaeological study has revealed that Lachish was a major military fortress in Israel, equipped with two surrounding walls and perched high on a massive hill, with a six-chambered gate. It was seemingly invincible.16 But it fell twice, once in 701 BC at the hands of the Assyrian army—probably the event referred to here—and later in 586 at the hands of the Babylonians. It was always one of the last fortified cities to experience defeat, probably because of its massive walls and capable army. Nevertheless, it *was* defeated. This should give pause to modern cultures, tempted to trust their massive armies and arsenals. Such idols are a lie, no matter how real and solid they seem to be. The *RMS Titanic*, the so-called ship that even God could not sink, stood symbolically at the beginning of a century that glorified human potential; by century's end, not only was the *Titanic* at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, but so also were many atheistic hopes and dreams. The directive of John's last statement in his letter to his community in the first century AD speaks volumes: "Little children, keep yourselves from idols" (1 John 5:21).

<span id="page-445-4"></span><span id="page-445-2"></span><span id="page-445-1"></span>At the end of Micah 1, Jerusalem is portrayed as a lamenting and helpless mother wailing over her population as she sees them heading into exile. This anticipates Jesus' lament over Jerusalem itself as he describes himself as a hen who wanted so much to gather its chicks under its wings, but to no avail (Matt. 23:37). But Jesus did not look on helplessly as his people went into exile. He went the way of the cross, submitting himself to humiliation, mutilation, and finally death, going into exile in their place.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-446-1"></span>To this point in the book, few reasons have been given for the judgment of Judah, but this lack is quickly remedied by this judgment oracle, which takes aim at wealthy landowners who devise ways and means to fulfill their covetous desires. They scheme up plans during the midnight hours to rob poor farmers of their houses and drive them from their land (Mic. 2:1–2). The indictment of these criminals is followed by another sentence by Yahweh in which the punishment equals the crime (cf. 1:7b). Yahweh himself devises judgment against these ancient opportunists and drives them from their land (2:3–4). What is more, they will never be able to reclaim their land nor their status in the congregation of Yahweh (v. 5).

		- b. Sentence Passed on the Covetous (2:3–5)

## *Comment*

<span id="page-447-6"></span>2:1–2 The biblical prophets often used judgment oracles in which an indictment was followed by a verdict. Here the indictment describes covetous wealthy landowners staying awake in order to imagine ways in which they can acquire more and more. At the crack of dawn they are up, seeking to fulfill their plans. They are probably involved in expropriating land because of unpaid debts, which may be due to crop failure (cf. also Isa. 5:8). Their wickedness is thus clear: instead of helping those who are suffering, they take advantage of them. The language of the text indicates that there is a regular predictability to their evil thoughts and actions:

<span id="page-447-4"></span> They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance. (Mic. 2:2)

<span id="page-447-7"></span>In the original text, the rhyming of the last word in each line stresses this regularity. The first pair of lines ends with *u* and the second pair with *o*. The key theological word here is "covet." This stresses that the theft and the subsequent social oppression both originate in the heart. It also shows that these thieves are rebelling against the Lord's covenant, since he made very clear that his people must not covet what belongs to others (Ex. 20:17).

<span id="page-447-3"></span><span id="page-447-0"></span>Micah prefaces such nefarious activity with the interjection "Woe" (*hoy*), which was often used at times of funerary lament (1 Kings 13:30). These people, who think they can do whatever they want whenever they want to whomever they want, receive a funeral lament pronounced over them. They are literally dead men walking!

<span id="page-447-10"></span><span id="page-447-9"></span><span id="page-447-8"></span><span id="page-447-5"></span>2:3–5 The sentence passed on the greedy landowners is quite appropriate. As they "devised" (v. 1) to steal land from the poor, so Yahweh "devises" (v. 3) to take their land away from them. Their arrogance and haughtiness will give way to laments and desperation as their land is given to an "apostate" (v. 4), probably a reference to the idolatrous Assyrian troops likely ravaging the land at the time. Furthermore, they will not only have their land removed; they themselves will be removed from the "assembly of the Lord" (v. 5), a reference to the worship community in Judah (cf. Deut. 23:2–4). The reference to casting lots refers to the apportionment of land by lot in the assembly of the Lord when land was first divided among the Israelites after the conquest (Josh. 14:2; 19:51). It may also foretell the time when Judah returns from exile and land is redistributed to the people. At such a time, these wicked landowners will have no portion in the Lord's land.

## <span id="page-447-2"></span><span id="page-447-1"></span>*Response*

Theologian Sally Brown captures well the thought of a passage like this:

Imagine [prosperous landholders] gathered at a benefit gala. Bursts of laughter ripple through the room; their mood is buoyant. Their common bond, in addition to an elite social standing, is a knack for finding the upside in a volatile land market. But just as they are lifting their glasses to congratulate themselves, the party is interrupted by a messenger. Drinks are poised mid-air; all are strained to listen. The messenger bears a funeral announcement? Whose? Theirs.17

It is not difficult to connect the dots to the twenty-first century, where millions of dollars have been made by the unscrupulous and dishonest. From Yahweh's point of view, people who engage in such practices are dead men walking. In fact, Paul describes life before Christ as that of spiritual death in trespasses and sins, following the covetous desires of the heart (Eph. 2:1–3).

<span id="page-448-3"></span>The origin of these desires is covetousness. Such sin is prohibited by the last of the Ten Commandments, a commandment different from all the rest: it is the only one that cannot be politically enforced by human beings. The heart is known only to oneself and God. Thus covetousness is a type of warning system, announcing that all is not right spiritually. The all-consuming desire to possess something illicit is a sign of idolatry, of making a substitute for God (Col. 3:5). The result is injustice, the failure to love one's neighbor.

<span id="page-448-4"></span><span id="page-448-2"></span><span id="page-448-1"></span><span id="page-448-0"></span>Jesus makes this crystal clear in his teaching concerning the dangers of covetousness. The story of the rich fool, who tears down his barns to build bigger ones in order to hoard his increased wealth, is a story of a heart gripped by covetousness (Luke 12:13–21). Covetousness cannot satisfy, for it is based on a faulty understanding of what it means to be human. As Jesus remarks, "One's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions" (Luke 12:15). Jesus tells his disciples not to fuss and fret about material things, but rather to put his kingdom first (Matt. 6:33). Then they will find a deep peace and will have all of their material needs met as well. With Christ now at the center of one's life, one can lay awake at night devising ways to bless people and empower them by serving and helping them. The life redeemed by God has God at the center and seeks to bring the divine order of shalom into society. Just as the covetous heart will find more and more ways to oppress in order to fill an infinite spiritual vacuum, the heart with God at the center will be satisfied and will seek creative ways to express generosity and kindness.

They cannot imagine God's anger toward his own people ("Has the Lord grown impatient?"; 2:7b). But Micah provides a stunning theological counterattack, arguing that the covenant stipulations require a life of obedience ("him who walks uprightly"; 2:7d) and that these rich landowners have attacked helpless people and divested women and children of house and home (2:8–9). They are commanded to leave the land because they have made it unclean (2:10). In a final retort, Micah calls out such spiritual supporters of a corrupt establishment as nothing but false purveyors of a prosperity gospel (2:11). They are interested only in being popular, not in being faithful.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-450-2"></span><span id="page-450-1"></span>2:6 Micah's message of judgment did not sit well with many in his audience, including his prophetic colleagues. They tell him to stop preaching, using a word that may be a derogatory word for prophesying, implying that he is "dripping on" like an annoying nag. The word is used for droplets of moisture in many contexts (Judg. 5:4; Prov. 5:3; Joel 3:18). These prophets view Micah and people like him as needlessly bothering others with their judgment oracles. After this initial sentence, it becomes difficult to identify the speakers in the text. The best view (cf. Introduction: Interpretive Challenges for other options) is perhaps to understand Micah as immediately responding to these prophets with, "They will not preach about these things" (i.e., judgment), rather than to understand the false prophets to be saying, "One should not preach of such things."

Micah then goes on to say that "He [God] will not remove disgraces," or "Disgraces will not be removed." In other words, Micah is stating that if judgment is not preached, people will keep going on merrily along their way, assuming that everything is all right, and judgment will not be averted. (The other interpretation requires significant textual emendation to read, "Disgrace will not overtake us." With this reading, the words are those of the false prophets, who state that judgment will certainly not come.)

<span id="page-450-3"></span><span id="page-450-0"></span>2:7 This verse includes a series of four rhetorical questions, three expecting a negative answer and therefore probably the words of the false prophets. These are countered with a rhetorical question using the first person singular pronoun, referring to God, and this is therefore probably Micah contradicting the previous rhetorical questions with his own, which assumes a positive answer. "Should this be said, O house of Jacob?" is probably a response to Micah's preaching of judgment. The false prophets asking the question clearly expect the answer to be "No!" The history of Israel included a notorious attempt to curse Jacob, which God turned into a blessing (Numbers 22–24). The second question, "Has the Lord grown impatient?" literally reads in Hebrew, "Has the Spirit of the Lord become short?" and refers to having a "short temper." The answer is again negative. The last question, "Are these his deeds?" probably refers to the acts of judgment Micah is prophesying and may refer to the Assyrian soldiers outside the walls of Jerusalem at that very moment. Again a negative answer is expected. In short, the false prophets are emphasizing that the Lord's judgment will not come.

Speaking through Micah, the Lord counters these questions with one of his own: "Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?" Here God interrupts all of these questions by bringing his people back to the main terms of the covenant, in which righteousness and justice were expected—otherwise, curse would result (cf. Deuteronomy 28). In the Hebrew, the phrase "walks uprightly" was used to contrast those who pleased the Lord with those who were earlier condemned for walking arrogantly instead of uprightly (Mic. 2:3)

<span id="page-451-6"></span><span id="page-451-5"></span><span id="page-451-2"></span>2:8 Now Micah lambasts his unfaithful colleagues with a litany of ways in which the wealthy landowners are walking arrogantly, becoming an enemy to their own people, suddenly and unexpectedly robbing people of their garments. It is as if the people have returned from war not expecting to be attacked by their own neighbors.

<span id="page-451-7"></span><span id="page-451-3"></span>2:9 Moreover, women are driven from their domiciles, and children, here called "my splendor," have also been taken away, probably to serve in debt slavery (cf. 2 Kings 4:1–7). All three of these crimes—robbing garments, driving women from their homes, and reducing children to debt slavery—are crimes against the vulnerable. In this case the husband is probably missing because he is serving as an indentured servant; his wife has to leave her home because the land has been expropriated, and thus she is particularly vulnerable—as are her "orphaned" children.

<span id="page-451-8"></span><span id="page-451-4"></span><span id="page-451-1"></span><span id="page-451-0"></span>2:10 Micah is now very angry, essentially telling these wealthy landowners and their spiritual sycophants to "Get lost!" i.e., to "Get out of here!" He tells them to get up and leave the land, "for this is no place to rest." The word "rest" is a rich theological word, with overtones of peace and security; it emphasizes all the blessings of the Promised Land for the people of God (Ex. 33:14; Josh. 21:44; Isa. 28:12). Its verbal counterpart first occurs when God places Adam in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:15), thus indicating a place where all human needs are to be met, both physically with the abundant fruit of the garden, and also spiritually with the presence of God. Micah later provides a perfect word picture of what "rest" will mean under the Messiah's rule: "They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken" (Mic. 4:4).

<span id="page-451-10"></span>But Judah in Micah's time is anything but such a place. In fact, it has become unclean, and such uncleanness "destroys with a grievous destruction." "Uncleanness" is a highly charged religious word indicating that which must never come into contact with the holy. Here the entire land—which was supposed to be a place of holiness—has become defiled by the moral filth of the wealthy and their prophetic puppets. Both groups need to get out to a foreign, unclean land, where they will be better served. In this way, Israel will get the defilement and pollution out of their land.

<span id="page-451-9"></span>2:11 Micah now turns to the false prophets and uses the same potentially derogatory word they had used for his preaching at the beginning of the oracle. He <span id="page-452-7"></span><span id="page-452-6"></span>imagines a windbag (lit., one who "walks with the wind, and utters lies"), saying, in effect, "I will prophesy of wine and beer." That person is just the preacher (dripper) for this people. To prophesy only of wine and beer is to bear a message about the life of pleasure and nothing else. "Wine and strong drink" could denote the good life in a positive sense in Israel, as wine was regarded as a divine gift (Ps. 104:15), but it could also become a ruthless master if one was not careful. It was regarded as the bane of kings, since it could cloud judgment (Prov. 31:4–7). Nazirites and priests on duty were forbidden to imbibe (Lev. 10:9; Num. 6:3; Judg. 13:4, 7). Micah's contemporary Isaiah spoke of endless partying with no concern about the serious issues of life (Isa. 5:11–12). Thus these prophets are prosperity preachers. They say, "Don't worry about anything. Be happy! Everything will be fine!" They are nothing but liars.

<span id="page-452-11"></span><span id="page-452-5"></span><span id="page-452-1"></span><span id="page-452-0"></span>From even a casual reading of the prophetic books, it is clear that the true prophets faced perhaps their strongest opposition from their own prophetic colleagues in ministry. Such theological opponents were often on the side of the establishment (cf. 1 Kings 22). But they should not be viewed as theologically naive or illiterate. They also read the narrative of Israel's history, but they had come to a different conclusion. The Israelite credo spoke of Yahweh's forgiving and compassionate nature, his patience and longsuffering (Ex. 34:6–7). Israel's traditions also stressed its election and special status as Yahweh's people, as well as Jerusalem and the temple as the center of the earth (Gen. 12:1–3; Deuteronomy 7; Psalms 46–48; Ezek. 38:12; Amos 3:1–2). From such a reading, Micah's opponents concluded that Israel had a "free pass." Yahweh had invested too much in his people to judge them. But this was clearly a one-sided reading of the narrative. This was theological "cherry-picking," because the credo was equally devoted to the fact that God would not acquit the guilty (Ex. 34:7b), and the purpose of election was to produce the fruit of justice and righteousness (Isa. 5:1–7), for the people to be beacons of light to the nations (Isaiah 60). On the other side of the cross, Christian believers do not get a free pass either. Jesus calls his people to "the holiness without which no one will see the Lord" (Heb. 12:14).

<span id="page-452-12"></span><span id="page-452-10"></span><span id="page-452-8"></span><span id="page-452-2"></span>Thus ministers of the gospel and believers should expect not merely nonbelievers to disagree with them. From time to time there will be opponents from within the household of faith, with a different reading of Scripture. Their reading must be challenged from the Scriptures and from experience. If their reading is that God's justice will never come on those who claim to be his people, no matter how wickedly they live, then their reading is deficient. If their reading is causing justice and mercy to be neglected, while the wealthy profit, then it is defective. Sometimes it may be necessary to tell such false teachers to "Get out!" of the church.

**<sup>12</sup>** I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob; I will gather the remnant of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture, a noisy multitude of men. **<sup>13</sup>** He who opens the breach goes up before them; they break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king passes on before them, the Lord at their head.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-453-4"></span><span id="page-453-2"></span>This oracle suddenly and abruptly changes in theme from judgment to salvation, providing an effective conclusion to the entire first section in Micah. The theme of judgment, particularly in the form of exile, has been pervasive. Yet this oracle is an announcement of salvation for the exiles. Jacob and Israel, which have been castigated, are now saved—even if only a remnant is left (2:12). Yet they are as numerous as a flock and are gathered together behind the walls of their exilic prison (v. 13). A person named the "Breacher" (one who "opens the breach"; v. 13a) goes before them and smashes down part of the wall, and this person is none other than King Yahweh, who leads his people out of their prison (v. 13b). When the Lord went forth from his holy temple to judge the earth, creation collapsed before him and the cities of Samaria and southwest Judah were demolished (1:2–16). Now the Lord smashes down the walls of an exilic prison so that his people can escape.

<span id="page-453-5"></span><span id="page-453-0"></span>The overall aim of this oracle is to provide a positive ending—albeit a short one—to the first round of judgment oracles. These themes of salvation, a remnant, a flock, and the Lord/Shepherd-King will be developed further in the next two rounds of oracles.

<span id="page-453-1"></span>The sudden nature of this salvation oracle has prompted a significant group of scholars to wonder whether it has been misinterpreted, since it seems to be so much at odds with its context. Thus some conclude that it is an example of a "salvation" oracle from the mouths of the false prophets mentioned in 2:6–11. But the false prophets probably never saw the present predicament as divine judgment from which one needed to be saved. Other scholars interpret it as an oracle of judgment, i.e., that Yahweh is gathering the surrounding inhabitants in Jerusalem during the Assyrian crisis to lead them into exile into Assyria. Both of these maneuvers are unnecessary when one sees this oracle within the overall structure of the book of Micah (cf. Introduction: Interpretive Challenges). It is the final answer to the judgment of exile. God will not abandon his people.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-454-0"></span>2:12 "I will surely assemble" is an abrupt change from third person to first person, and the Hebrew form of these words is emphatic, showing Yahweh's firm resolve to save. These references to gathering the remnant of Israel assume a long period of time in which Israel has been devastated through judgment and only a remnant of the people is left. "Remnant" is a profound theological concept, referring to survivors of a crisis. The concept is found in rescues such as Noah and his family surviving the flood (Genesis 6–9) or Lot and his family escaping the judgment of Sodom (Genesis 19). But the first use of the actual word occurs when Joseph is used by God to preserve his family through the crisis of a worldwide famine (Gen. 45:7). Similarly, the verbal form of the word ("to leave a remnant") is used in 1 Kings to indicate God's reserving of seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal during the mass apostasy of Elijah's time (1 Kings 19:18).

<span id="page-454-5"></span><span id="page-454-4"></span><span id="page-454-3"></span><span id="page-454-2"></span><span id="page-454-1"></span>Isaiah uses a word built on the Hebrew root for "remnant" to name his son *Shear*-jashub: "a remnant [of the people] shall return" after the coming judgment (Isa. 7:3). In particular, the term "remnant" used here in Micah becomes a technical term in prophecy for the remainder of the nation that survives judgment and is used by God for his salvific purposes (cf. Isa 37:32; Zeph. 3:13). This determination of Yahweh to save a remnant shows his absolute commitment to his ancient promises. The change to shepherd imagery in the latter part of the verse recalls imagery from Israel's past, as Israel is like a scattered flock that will be saved by the divine Shepherd-King. The last phrase, "a noisy multitude of men," could hold a number of meanings. The Hebrew literally reads, "they [the gathered sheep] will be noisy from man." The preposition "from" can mean separation, i.e., the sheep will be far away from human beings, but this does not make much sense in the context, since presumably there are many humans around. The preposition can also have a causal meaning, for which there are two possible meanings. The sheep's bleating could be due to their fear of human beings, which would make sense in the context, since they would be afraid of harm.18 But it can also mean that the very loud uproar is due to a large number of people being present. Thus the metaphor may change here from sheep to people. The sheep are in fact Judah's exiles, who have become large in number as a result of their being gathered into one place by the work of a tender shepherd. This sense best suits the context.

<span id="page-455-4"></span>2:13 The scene subtly shifts from sheep gathered in a pen to humans gathered behind walls of a city, imprisoned in exile. Although they have been gathered, this is not the final word. One who makes a breach goes before them to break them out. But before they break free, their King passes over them, Yahweh at their head. This is a remarkable text, bringing together a variety of powerful images: the imagery of sheep in a pen, people behind walls, and Yahweh appearing both as a Shepherd-King and as one who breaches walls to lead his people to freedom. The word for "he who opens a breach" is used in a number of contexts in Scripture and indicates the notion of "breaking through" or "breaching." Thus a baby can be named Perez ("Breacher") because he has broken out from the womb before his twin (Gen. 38:29). Servants who escape (break away) from their masters can be described with this verb (1 Sam. 25:10). In keeping with this sense, a city wall that provides safety from the enemy can be breached during war (2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chron. 26:6; 32:5). Here the word indicates King Yahweh's appearing amid the exiles and breaking them out of their exilic prison. Thus, for Judah, grace is the last word, once the people have passed through the crucible of judgment.

This final oracle of the first section of Micah shows the importance of balancing judgment oracles with a final note of grace. This is a theme in most of the prophetic books. Such books include many notes of judgment, but these are frequently balanced by divine grace. Perhaps it is for this reason that Ben Sira, in a book written in the early second century BC, described the twelve prophets as bringing comfort to Israel (*Sir.* 49:10–12). This is clearly not cheap grace but costly grace.

This text is a reminder of God's pledge to keep his covenant. The people do not deserve this kindness, but God has made a covenant, and when things seem terribly bleak, he will break down whatever barrier imprisons and enslaves his people. The remnant theme is crucial to the realization of God's promises: there will always be faithful ones whom God preserves in times of crisis. This concept plays an important role in Paul's thought (Romans 9–11). God's promises will finally stand.

<span id="page-455-7"></span><span id="page-455-6"></span><span id="page-455-5"></span>The NT amplifies more of these themes: Jesus prays for shepherds to seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel (Matt. 9:35–38). He himself is the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for the flock (John 10:14–15). He is the ultimate Breaker of the prison house of death. It is because he breaches the walls of his own tomb that he can breach the walls of the tomb imprisoning humanity: "The event of resurrection breaks open the world of death."19 And in the final book of the Bible, Revelation, these themes finally "break out" in all their power. The saints escape from Babylon as its walls come crumbling down (Revelation 17–18) and they are led home, where they will enjoy eternal bliss: "The Lamb in the midst of the throne

<span id="page-456-9"></span><span id="page-456-8"></span><span id="page-456-7"></span>The contrast between the corruption of the previous leaders and Yahweh's concern for liberation and empowerment is sharp. Contemporary leaders need to ask themselves if their leadership is oppressive or empowering, leading people into bondage or liberation. They need to live in light of the past liberation from the prison house of sin because of the death and resurrection of Christ, and in light of the future liberation of the planet from death, which will happen at the second coming of Christ (Romans 12–13; 1 Corinthians 15; Ephesians 4–6). It is Christ who provides the model of leadership, and his shepherds must follow in his paths (John 10:3–4; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2). Sadly, however, not all leaders walk in God's ways (Jude 12), and the contrast between good and evil leadership will become even sharper in the next section of Micah.

## <span id="page-456-1"></span>OVERVIEW OF

## <span id="page-456-3"></span>MICAH 3:1–5:15

<span id="page-456-2"></span><span id="page-456-0"></span>The second movement of judgment and salvation develops themes from the first movement, intensifying and expanding them. The section begins on a note that contrasts radically with the last oracle. In that speech, Yahweh was at the head of the people, liberating them from the prison house of their future exile (2:13). Micah now returns to the present, to corrupt judicial and political leaders; they too are at the head of the people (3:1), but they *cannibalize* them (3:2–3). Yahweh is he who leads his people through the gate of exile and breaches the prison wall, while the current leaders spread the flesh of their victims in a pot and break their bones. But the Lord takes notice. Two more judgment oracles follow, one directed at the false prophets (3:5–8) and another directed at the entire political and religious establishment, including the most sacred institution in Israel: the temple (3:9–12).

<span id="page-456-6"></span><span id="page-456-5"></span><span id="page-456-4"></span>By the time we reach the conclusion of chapter 3, it seems like Judah is at an end. In reality, these severe judgments are the precursor to a new beginning, and a salvation oracle is placed alongside the last and most severe judgment oracle to show that in the last days, the end of history, the razed temple will be raised to the highest elevation in the whole world to be a beacon of hope and peace for the entire earth (4:1–5). Then, a new section of oracles in chiastic form shows how this goal will be achieved (the parenthetical phrases below are the opening lines of each section, signaling the links between the respective units):

- 
- <span id="page-457-5"></span><span id="page-457-4"></span>A. Yahweh the Shepherd-King (4:6–7) ("In that day, declares the Lord")
	- B. Jerusalem (4:8–5:1) ("you, O Tower of the flock, hill of . . . Zion")
	- B'. Bethlehem (5:2–9) ("But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah")
- <span id="page-457-7"></span><span id="page-457-6"></span>A'. Yahweh the Warrior-King (5:10–15) ("And in that day, declares the Lord")

<span id="page-457-3"></span><span id="page-457-1"></span>The end of history will also coincide with the return of the ragtag remnant led by Yahweh the Shepherd-King (A; 4:6–7), resulting in the destruction of every form of idolatry and an appeal to the nations (A'; 5:10–15). But between the present and the end, Jerusalem will experience a time of intense agony likened to birth pangs, from which it will be delivered (4:8–5:1). Deliverance will eventually come from the town of Bethlehem, where a mother will give birth to a son who will eventually rule the nations (B'; 5:2–9). Thus these four units indicate the process by which the temple will be elevated as a beacon to the nations in 4:1–5. Moreover, while the oracles in chapter 3 continue and intensify the judgment found in 1:2–2:11, the oracles in chapters 4–5 amplify the oracle of salvation in 2:12–13.

## MICAH 3:1–4

1Hebrew *from off them*

## *Section Overview*

This passage is the beginning of a triad of judgment oracles, focusing on the corruption of the judicial system in Judah. It uses macabre imagery in its indictment (3:2–3) to indicate the horrific nature of injustice. Human victims crying out for justice should receive help from the courts, their last resort in society. But instead they are cannibalized. In a punishment fit for the crime, sentence is passed on the unjust: when they cry out for help to the ultimate Judge in their time of need, he will in no way answer them (v. 4).

## <span id="page-458-8"></span><span id="page-458-5"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-458-2"></span>3:1–3 This new section begins with an oracle of judgment against the leadership of the nation, consisting of an indictment (3:1–3) followed by a sentence (v. 4). Although the word used here for leaders ("rulers") often has to do with political and military leadership (cf. Judg. 11:6, 11), in this context it particularly includes judicial leadership, as the responsibility of these leaders is to make legal judgments. They are entrusted with "knowing justice": what it is and how to administer it (Mic. 3:1). These leaders were to love good and hate evil, just as Yahweh required of those who love him (Ps. 97:10). In fact, when judges were first appointed in Israel, they were to be marked by fear of God, faithfulness, and hatred of bribes (Ex. 18:21). Moreover, they were to make their legal decisions impartially and practice fairness in all their dealings (Deut. 16:18, 19).

<span id="page-458-7"></span><span id="page-458-6"></span><span id="page-458-4"></span><span id="page-458-3"></span><span id="page-458-1"></span><span id="page-458-0"></span>But the exact opposite is the case with the judicial leadership in Judah. They "hate the good and love the evil" (Mic. 3:2). When the needy seek justice, they receive injustice instead (vv. 2–3). The place of help becomes the place of greater oppression. In fact, these victims of injustice seeking justice are figuratively cannibalized when they come to court! Micah paints a graphic image in which these wicked judges treat the people as animals to be slaughtered, flayed, chopped up, and consumed. "What the farmer in [Israel] routinely does to his cattle, the leaders in the capital city do to human beings."20 The prophet presents his description in this manner in order to strike the hardened conscience of the judicial officials. He prolongs the description by using wordplay to show the perverse nature of what they are doing: They should be engaged in justice (*mishpat*), but instead they strip (*hipshitu*) the skin off the people, preparing them for consumption.

3:4 Just as these judicial leaders have not provided help in the day of distress when victims of injustice have come for help, there will come a time when they themselves will cry out for help but will receive no answer. The word for "cry" suggests the kind <span id="page-459-2"></span><span id="page-459-1"></span><span id="page-459-0"></span>of desperate request for help that comes as a result of extreme oppression. The Israelites cried out because of their cruel bondage in Egypt (Ex. 2:23) or because of tyrannical coercion in the time of the judges (Judg. 3:9). Tamar cried out in agony after she was raped by Amnon (2 Sam. 13:19). Eventually there will come a time when the judicial leaders will experience the same plight experienced by the people who came to them seeking justice. These leaders will cry out to the supreme Judge, Yahweh, but there will be no answer. In fact, Yahweh will hide his face. This suggests that Yahweh will turn away in disgust from their prayers. Just as the suffering servant was one whose appearance caused people to hide their faces from him (Isa. 53:3), the requests of these oppressors will cause Yahweh to do the same.

<span id="page-459-3"></span>As if to emphasize the justness of the sentence, the text sums up the indictment in a single clause: "They have made their deeds evil."

#### *Response*

This text is one of the most macabre in the entire Bible, as it puts on graphic display the incredible corruption of the judicial system in ancient Judah. The use of the cannibalism metaphor is an attempt to shock into sensibility the seared conscience of the judges and make it healthy again. People had become commodities, to devour and digest. Thinking they could get help from the courts because of the injustice in society, the people do not merely get ripped off—they get ripped apart. Contemporary culture could learn from Micah.

A consumer society often consumes its own. Ancient Rome, depicted as Babylon, trafficked in human flesh:

<span id="page-459-5"></span>And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore, cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble, cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, *that is, human souls*. (Rev. 18:11–13)

The multibillion-dollar pornography and human trafficking industries, the proliferation of abortion in the West and gendercide in Asia, and abuse of workers in unsafe working conditions shows how consumption of humans runs rampant today.

Unfortunately, this happens not only in the wider culture but in churches as well, when helpless people become the victims of priests and ministers and spiritual leaders. Such people are abused not only physically but also mentally and spiritually. In a notorious example, a young woman abused by her spiritual leader complained that she felt "like a piece of hamburger somebody threw out in the street."21

<span id="page-459-4"></span>This text is a vivid reminder to the nations (Mic. 1:2)—as well as to the believing community: God will not stand idly by amid the violation of his moral order. The maxim "What goes around comes around" is not the result of an impersonal

<span id="page-460-6"></span><span id="page-460-4"></span><span id="page-460-3"></span>People of faith need to be reminded that human beings are not objects; they are subjects made in the image of God. They are never resources to be used but beings to be loved. Instead of using people and loving things, the church must love people and use things. People in positions of power must never use that power to hurt or destroy but instead to serve and empower. The ultimate example is a Savior and Lord who never used people but rather served them (Mark 10:45), washing their feet (John 13:1–17) and healing their bodies and souls (Matt. 4:23–25). He himself offered his body on a tree and was wounded for human sins and iniquities (1 Pet. 2:24). Thus one of the sacraments of the Christian Church is the consumption of the bread and the wine, the symbols of the body and blood of Christ, given in love for his people, a vivid reminder of the vast difference between the leaders in Micah 3:1–4 and the ultimate Leader, Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 11:23–26). If we are his followers, we will love and serve others as he did.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-460-1"></span>This new judgment oracle continues the theme of the corruption of Judah's leadership (Mic. 3:5–7), and to it is appended Micah's own definition of a true prophet <span id="page-461-3"></span><span id="page-461-2"></span>(v. 8). The leaders in view are the prophets also mentioned in the first round of Micah's oracles (2:6–11). These prophets are condemned in this indictment as religious mercenaries who lead the people astray (3:5). Thus they will be led astray when the light of their prophetic inspiration is turned off by Yahweh (vv. 6–7). The true prophet works not for money but for God (v. 8).

	- b. Sentence: The Sun Sets (3:6–7)
	- c. The Sun Shines (3:8)

## <span id="page-461-7"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-461-1"></span>3:5 Micah begins with a standard prophetic formula: "Thus says the Lord." Prophets used this formula frequently to emphasize that their words were not their own but were the words of God (so also 2:3). Micah is thus making clear that he is condemning these prophets with a prophetic word.

Micah then announces that the prophets "lead [the] people astray." This is the exact opposite of a prophet's reason for being. They were called originally to give guidance of the most reliable kind: revealing God's will to the people. But Micah says that they have betrayed their calling, purposely misguiding the people. It would be like a doctor charged with healing instead using her talents to kill. The revelation continues to explain why the prophets are doing this: they are mercenaries, proclaiming peace to those who pay while declaring war against those who do not. Their greed is emphasized by the payment they are looking for: food for their voracious appetites. The end result is that these prophets are no longer speaking oracles from God. Rather, it is the audience that determines what these "prophetic" oracles are: "What comes out of the mouth of these prophets depends on what has been put into it."22

<span id="page-461-6"></span><span id="page-461-4"></span><span id="page-461-0"></span>3:6–7 While the indictment of these prophets is brief, the sentence is quite lengthy. It declares in a variety of ways, first, the "solar eclipse" of their inspiration (v. 6) and, second, the consequences of that eclipse (v. 7). The words in verse 6 are replete with "darkness." This suggests that the light of prophecy has gone out. Some commentators claim that these false prophets were never true prophets, but the text suggests otherwise. These appear to be true prophets who have become corrupt and faithless to their calling to speak for Yahweh. In a punishment fitting the crime, Yahweh has thus stopped speaking to them. The consequence of this loss of inspiration is the loss of authority and authenticity; the prophets will thus be put to shame and disgraced, covering their "lips." This phrase in Hebrew means literally to "cover their mustache"—a sign of humiliation. Lepers had to cover their faces as a sign of disgrace and mourning (Lev. 13:45), and this was the normal practice

<span id="page-462-0"></span>for mourning the dead as well (Ezek. 24:17, 22). Thus these greedy prophets will become social lepers, bywords for corruption and falsehood.

<span id="page-462-1"></span>3:8 Micah now gives a shining example of what a true prophet should be like. He is such a person because he is filled with power and justice:

- A. Power—the Spirit of Yahweh
	- B. Justice
- A'. Strength

The Spirit of Yahweh is intimately tied to power (as suggested here by the lack of a conjunction between the word "power" and the phrase "the Spirit of the Lord"). This is not just any power; it is the Spirit of Yahweh. Moreover, this power and strength are not arbitrary but are intimately tied to justice. Power and justice are both necessary, for power without justice is tyrannical (of which we have seen many examples already in Micah), while justice without power has no effect.23 Micah's statement probably means he is able to declare boldly a message of justice (B) because he is powerfully filled with the Spirit of Yahweh (A, A').

Such a message is further qualified as "to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin." This was not a popular message, to be sure, but it was a just and true message that needed courage supplied by divine strength to announce.

## *Response*

A perennial temptation of those leading the church is to tone down the message, to make it more palatable to the hearer. When leaders surrender to this temptation, they start down a slippery slope of pleasing people rather than God, or of trying to seek fame and fortune with a message that will be popular rather than true. Thus true inspiration is lost, as one is serving other masters. Charles Templeton writes about this in *The Third Temptation*, in which a pastor who sincerely began a ministry yielded to the third temptation—the temptation of power and money—and lost his way. Sadly, many people whom the pastor led also lost their way. This could well be a parable about people called to ministry. What once began as a sincere desire to share the truth of God's Word in order to help people can become warped over time to an interest only in money. Jim Bakker was an American pastor in the 1980s who became well known for his lavish lifestyle and preaching of a prosperity gospel. Scandals eventually led to his removal from ministry and incarceration in prison. From prison Bakker wrote about his ministry in a way that seems almost eerily familiar to Micah's assessment of the false prophets:

The more I studied the Bible, however, I had to admit that the prosperity message did not line up with the tenor of Scripture. My heart was crushed to think *that I led so many people astray*. I was appalled that I could have been so wrong, and I was deeply grateful that God had not struck me dead as *a false prophet*. 24

<sup>23</sup> Ibid., 151–52; W. J. Wessels, "Micah 1: An Apt Introduction to Power Talks," *Skrif En Kerk* 19 (1998): 446.

<sup>24</sup> Jim Bakker, *I Was Wrong* (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1996), 535; emphasis mine.

The religious leader must seek constant inspiration from God. It is God's Word that must be paramount, and those speaking for him require a constant dependence upon his Spirit in order to tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Charles Spurgeon once remarked that the minister must be saturated in the divine Word until it becomes part of the soul and his blood becomes "Bibline."25 But that was not enough, for when Spurgeon himself ascended to his pulpit to preach the divine Word, he used to repeat to himself, "I believe in the Holy Ghost. I believe in the Holy Ghost. I believe in the Holy Ghost.26

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-463-1"></span><span id="page-463-0"></span>This is the last of a triad of judgment oracles, and it represents the literary climax of chapter 3. It is interested not merely in political and judicial leaders (3:1–4) or in prophets (vv. 5–8) but in all of them together, including the priests. Thus in one fell swoop this oracle is a comprehensive indictment of the entire leadership of Judah. Its indictment (vv. 9–11) also intensifies previous indictments, as the judicial leaders now detest justice and pervert everything that is upright. Its sentence (v. 12) would have dropped like a bomb on its first hearers: this beloved holy city and temple would be the target of the coming judgment.

	- a. Indictment: Bloody Zion's Famous Last Words (3:9–11)
	- b. Sentence: Bloody Zion's Death (3:12)

## *Comment*

<span id="page-464-4"></span><span id="page-464-2"></span>3:9 The word "detest" suggests a reaction to that which is aesthetically or morally repulsive. For example, Proverbs lists seven sins that are morally repulsive to God (Prov. 6:16–19). Ironically, while God loves justice, these leaders are so evil that they find justice repugnant. Similarly, they take what is straight and upright and twist it into something crooked. Their character is in every way opposite to the Lord's.

<span id="page-464-7"></span><span id="page-464-5"></span><span id="page-464-0"></span>3:10 The description continues: they "build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity." The idea may be that they have ruthlessly conscripted human beings for their construction projects at great cost to human life. In the Hebrew, "blood" is plural, suggesting a great amount of blood shed through oppression, namely, the forced labor of the workers (cf. Hab. 2:12). "Iniquity" emphasizes violent deeds. It can be used to describe murderers (2 Sam. 3:34, where "wicked" is lit. "sons of iniquity"), corrupt judges who show partiality (Ps. 82:2), or dishonest merchants who cheat their customers (Ezek. 18:8, "injustice"). In this context, it could refer to the iniquity of treating human life as of little importance, perhaps especially in the context of building projects.

<span id="page-464-3"></span><span id="page-464-1"></span>It is not entirely clear which building projects are in view. From archaeological research it is known there were massive building projects in Hezekiah's time to provide some protection for the city. There was the so-called Broad Wall, which was about 20 feet (6 m) thick and 27 feet (8.2 m) high and would have probably extended a few kilometers to provide protection for growing "suburbs" on the western side of Jerusalem. There was also the construction of a tunnel nearly 100 feet (30 m) underground for about one-half mile (0.8 km), from one part of the city to another, to divert water from the Gihon Spring to another part of the city, particularly for a time of siege. Again, it is not clear if these are the projects in view, but the overall point is clear: the human effort required to build these or similar projects would have extracted a severe toll on human life, and these leaders did not care at all. They are justly condemned.

<span id="page-464-6"></span>3:11 But Micah is not finished with his indictment. He blasts and condemns the leaders for the breadth and depth of their wicked corruption. The literal translation emphasizes the money the leaders seek by placing it in an emphatic position before the verb:

 Its heads—*for a bribe*—give judgment; Its priests—*for a price*—teach; Its prophets—*for money*—practice divination. (AT)

The heads—the judicial officials—are bought with bribes, and so their verdicts are unjust; the priests likewise have "sold out" to money as well, tailoring their teaching to the monetary payments they desire. The prophets' activity has become so bankrupt that it is compared to pagan divination. Moreover, they have led the people astray with their guidance so much so that they are totally oblivious to their imminent disaster: "Yet they lean on the Lord and say, 'Is not the Lord in the midst of us? No disaster shall come upon us.'" Their belief in the presence of the Lord is probably rooted in the physical symbol of the temple, which represents the presence of Yahweh graphically and concretely. As verse 12 will go on to show, their "prophetic" speech is nothing but (in)famous last words.

<span id="page-465-1"></span><span id="page-465-0"></span>3:12 Micah often begins a sentence of punishment with the conjunction "therefore" (cf. 2:3; 3:6), providing a suitable segue from the indictment to the penalty and reminding his audience that the latter is inextricably united to the former. "Because of you" emphasizes this link by referring back to the corrupt leaders of Judah. One can almost hear and see Micah pointing at them and calling them out.

A triad of lines expresses the unthinkable and completely contradicts the false prophets' words of assurance. Whereas they preached peace, Micah declares that nothing could be farther from the truth:

Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.

These three lines portray the absolute devastation of the holy city, particularly the temple hill. There is a gradual buildup to the final destruction of the temple. Zion was a term used for the original Jebusite city conquered by David (2 Sam. 5:7), but gradually its meaning became equivalent to the expanded city, Jerusalem. It is here plowed like a field, i.e., the city is turned into arable land. Then the name Jerusalem is used to indicate that the city has become a pile of ruins. And finally Micah zeroes in on the holiest site of the city, the Temple Mount: it will become simply overgrown with forest—as if nothing was ever built there. It has become a place for wild beasts. The devastation is final and complete.

## *Response*

This oracle concerning the destruction of the most sacred institution in Judah the temple—points to the futility of relying on structures and institutions and buildings in the absence of true worship, which promotes justice and righteousness and peace. When the city of peace is built on bloodshed, it is merely a matter of time before it becomes history. The same is true for denominations, churches, and Christian organizations. No one can truly rely on the Lord without having a true concern for justice and righteousness. The widespread phenomenon in Western culture of what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called "cheap grace" is disastrous.27

<sup>27</sup> "Cheap grace means the justification of sin without the justification of the sinner. Grace alone does everything, they say, and so everything can remain as it was before" (Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship* [New York: Touchstone, 1995], 43–44).

<span id="page-466-3"></span>Such a theology leads to antinomianism and the contemporary heresies associated with having Jesus Christ as Savior but not as Lord. Jesus himself makes clear that those who follow him must deny themselves and take up their cross (Matt. 16:24–26). In other words, the commitment must be total. In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ underscores that only those who *do* his will as well as listen to his words will be able to stand when the storm of judgment comes (Matt. 7:24–25). This is, of course, his true desire; believers have been made for his love, not his judgment.

<span id="page-466-2"></span><span id="page-466-1"></span><span id="page-466-0"></span>But warnings of judgment do have their place. History tells us that Micah's radical message of judgment helped avert divine judgment in his own time. It was this oracle in particular, remembered as the turning point, that caused the king and people to repent (Jer. 26:18–19). The preaching of judgment can affect change. May God raise up courageous messengers of the truth today!

## MICAH 4:1–5

4 It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it, **<sup>2</sup>** and many nations shall come, and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth the law,*<sup>1</sup>* and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. **<sup>3</sup>** He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide disputes for strong nations far away; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; **<sup>4</sup>** but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken. **<sup>5</sup>** For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God

## *Section Overview*

This new salvation oracle comes immediately after the triad of judgment oracles climaxing in the destruction of the temple and the turning of the holiest mountain into a forest, a haunt for wild animals. Now there is a dramatic contrast as the temple is raised to the heights, becoming a magnet for the nations because Yahweh is there. Thus this unit stands as a beautiful transition to the next two chapters. It provides a picture of the future glory of Zion as a place of peace and not bloodshed; as a place of truth and not corruption; as a place of blessing and not curse. It stands as the future goal from which the present Zion had become radically sidetracked (3:1–12).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-467-4"></span><span id="page-467-0"></span>4:1 This new announcement looks to the future, to the end of history, for this is what "the latter days" means here. By the time of Micah this phrase had become a technical term for the age in which God's kingdom would break into the historical realm and eventually end it (cf. Jer. 48:47; 49:39; Dan. 10:14; Hos. 3:5). In contrast to the corruption of Micah's day, the temple will become raised to the highest height at the end of history. It will become visible all around and will be a magnet to the nations, as they will literally "river" (ESV "flow") up the mountain from which they hear the law (*torah*) proclaimed.

<span id="page-467-5"></span><span id="page-467-3"></span><span id="page-467-1"></span>4:2 Previously, the law had not been proclaimed (the priests' job), nor were revealed words from the Lord delivered (the prophets' job), nor were the Lord's laws and words administered in society (the political and judicial leaders' job) (3:1–4, 5–8, 9–11). In the "latter days," however, things will be different as Yahweh will be the teacher and the prophet; the nations will take notice and desire to hear this teaching and walk in his ways.

<span id="page-467-6"></span>4:3 When the nations come to hear Yahweh, they will be dissatisfied with their own ways, which have been caused by idolatry and have led to war. Yahweh will "judge between" them, not in terms of condemning them but in terms of correcting them. Yahweh will speak the truth to them, leading to a transformation in the most conspicuous way possible among peoples. They will give up the practice of war for the practice of peace. Instruments used for war and killing will be transformed into instruments for producing life—developing agriculture so that people might have food.28 The result is that war will become obsolete.

<sup>28</sup> A pruning hook was a tool with a sharp curved blade to remove dead tissue from plants so that they might flourish and grow more fruitfully.

<span id="page-468-4"></span><span id="page-468-2"></span><span id="page-468-0"></span>4:4 In the absence of war, every man will dwell under his own vine and fig tree in complete security, without fear. These agrarian metaphors are probably meant to echo the garden of Eden and the promised messianic age (Gen. 49:11). Centuries before, Solomon's early rule of peace and plenty for everyone had realized this reality to some degree (1 Kings 4:25), and the prophet Zechariah predicts that it will be the mark of forgiveness and healing of the land in the coming kingdom of Yahweh (Zech. 3:10). There will be no need for war because all will have followed the law and will be satisfied.

<span id="page-468-6"></span>This new situation is not just a figment of Micah's imagination: "The mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken." This is the only time in Micah that Yahweh is called the "Lord of hosts"; the name indicates that Yahweh commands all of the heavenly armies—he is the commander-in-chief. The Septuagint sometimes translates this title with "Lord Almighty" (cf. 2 Sam. 7:8; Gk. *kyrios pantokratōr*), indicating omnipotence.29 This title guarantees the fulfillment of the announcement.

<span id="page-468-5"></span><span id="page-468-1"></span>4:5 This verse returns the audience to the present and the current practice of idolatry among the nations. Is it any wonder they are at war? They all walk in the names of their own gods. War is a result, finally, of idolatry, as is all brokenness and sin in this world. When people lose the center, all hell breaks loose: "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold" (Yeats). In view of these facts, Micah urges Judah to get its act together so that they may be a beacon to the nations now. If they walk now in the name of Yahweh, they will be a sign of a peaceful future amid the present warring world. Perhaps when the nations see them listening to the Torah and the true prophets and putting their words into practice, they will see the divine intention for the world realized and will give up their warlike practices.

### *Response*

Micah's call to Judah to respond to the future in the present shows clearly the purpose of prophecy. It is not primarily to give abstract information about the future; it speaks, rather, to the present—rebuking, challenging, warning, comforting, healing. Thus this passage reveals God's ultimate plan for the world, against the backdrop of the worst possible nightmare for ancient Judah—the announcement of the destruction of the temple (3:12). Out of this darkness comes a brilliant flash of the sun.

<span id="page-468-7"></span><span id="page-468-3"></span>Some NT evidence suggests an analogy between the destruction of the old Zion and its temple and the birth of a new city on a hill and a new temple. For example, on the verge of his own death, Jesus purges the temple and prophesies its destruction, along with the city of Jerusalem (Matt. 21:12–16; 24:1–21). But he himself prophesied that if the temple was destroyed, he would raise it up after three days (John 2:13–22). He was speaking of the temple of his body, the final locus of God's presence, to which the temple building pointed. Further, the new Zion consists of Christ's disciples, likened to a city set on a hill, displaying the light of God's glory

<span id="page-468-8"></span><sup>29</sup> Stephen G. Dempster, "The Lord Is His Name: A Study of the Distribution of the Names and Titles of God in the Book of Amos," *Revue Biblique* 98 (1991) 170–189.

<span id="page-469-4"></span><span id="page-469-2"></span>through good works, which leads others to glorify God (Matt. 5:13–16). What is more, Paul suggests that the church, consisting of both Jew and Gentile, is the new temple, announcing God's presence to the world (Eph. 2:18–22). Finally, it may be noted that this presence is predominantly one of peace (Eph. 2:14, 15, 17).

<span id="page-469-3"></span>There are myriad examples in which the church has manifested this peace. One striking recent example comes from Mozambique. An Anglican bishop named Dinis Sengulane decided to do something about the proliferation of arms in his country near the end of a civil war that had decimated the nation. He went to every province and asked people what they thought might jeopardize peace in the future. One person responded, "Guns. We have so many guns in our hands. Both sides have been very generous in dishing out guns just like that, so when peace comes, are those guns going to be just left alone?"30 The bishop was not prepared for this question, but after much prayer and reflection on the books of Micah and Isaiah, he announced that disarmament would begin, issuing a request that guns be returned to collection centers throughout the land. Many of the guns were made into instruments for production, so that rifles became saxophones, while gunstocks were used to make chairs and other furniture. Since this program started, over one million guns and other weapons have been collected and transformed. The program was called Turning Swords into Ploughshares. If this can be done in the war-torn country of Mozambique, imagine what could happen if Christians in other countries got their act together and heard the call to be emissaries of peace so that weapons were no longer needed for protection or peace.

<span id="page-469-1"></span>This is the first of a sequence of salvation oracles (matched by one with a similar opening formula in 5:10–15; cf. comments). Yahweh transforms a group of motley survivors of the judgment into the beginning of his new kingdom on earth.

		- b. The Weak Made Strong (4:7)

## <span id="page-470-4"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-470-2"></span>4:6 The introductory formula "In that day" specifies the time in which the predicted actions will take place. In this case, it refers back to the temporal formula beginning the previous oracle: "In the latter days." The gathering of the weak thus occurs in the general period that marks the end of history and the intervention of Yahweh's new world order. The clause "I will assemble . . . and gather" indicates that Yahweh will bring his remnant back from exile. The promise was already made in 2:12, but here adjectives are added: the ones gathered are the "lame . . . driven away . . . afflicted." Micah may intend for his audience to hear in the first adjective the story of Jacob—of when he struggled with God and was crippled but was made into a new man, Israel, when he returned home (Genesis 32). The same will happen to the exiles—they will become Yahweh's new people. Though they have been driven away and punished by God, they will be assembled and gathered. They are the most unlikely raw material with which to build a new nation. The Lord will not forget his covenant; he will rescue and renew his people.

<span id="page-470-1"></span><span id="page-470-0"></span>4:7 Yahweh shapes this motley group of survivors—the lame—into a remnant, that is, a core of his people who will be the recipients of his action in the world. They will become in many ways a mighty force in history. The parallel line reinforces this, as the lame are referred to as those who had been cast off but are now made into a strong nation. The word "lame" may be used again to emphasize Israel's origins, and the word "strong nation" does the same by evoking the promise to Abraham that he would become a great nation through which all the nations would be blessed (Gen. 12:1–3; 18:18). This makes clear that Yahweh has done this because of his commitment to the covenant. It is Yahweh who brings about this transformation. And it is he who will reign over them in "Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore." The language intentionally echoes the previous oracle about Zion and Micah's exhortation to the people to walk under Yahweh's rule forever and ever. Thus this oracle probably signals the beginning of the time when Zion will be elevated. Yahweh will first bring the remnant back and restore his rule to Zion, and then he will issue the Torah to the nations.

## *Response*

This text is an OT example of Paul's statement to the Corinthians:

Consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. (1 Cor. 1:26–29)

<span id="page-471-3"></span>In reading these words, it is natural to think of what we read in the Gospels as well. When Christ called the twelve disciples, he again gathered the lowly and weak to reconstitute a remnant, which would become a great nation, a new twelve tribes of Israel. Fishermen, tax collectors, prostitutes, sinners, "outsiders" were among the first members of this remnant (Mark 1:16–20; Matt. 9:1–13; Luke 7:36–50). Jesus did not choose the powerful and strong.

<span id="page-471-2"></span><span id="page-471-0"></span>In the contemporary church, the concern for status, prestige, and size, as well as for hoping to attract the "right type" of people, continues to mark many congregations, but seeking these qualities is plainly at odds with what God is doing in the building of his kingdom. The lame, the exiles, the blind, the nothings of this world constitute the stuff of which the kingdom is made. Martin Luther once remarked, on Genesis 1:1, "God created the world out of nothing. As long as you are not yet nothing, God cannot make something out of you."31 The church must never forget its roots. It constitutes the community not merely of the crippled but also of the crucified. Living out of its weakness, the church then becomes strong, a mighty nation over whom the crucified God rules.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-472-1"></span>This unit of salvation speeches consists of four oracles oriented to the present time of suffering and crisis (4:8, 9–10, 11–13; 5:1). In the first three, the crisis is resolved; in the last (5:1), the crisis is left unresolved in order to bring it into sharp contrast with the next major unit, the arrival of the Messiah and his work (5:2–9).

### <span id="page-472-3"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-472-0"></span>4:8 "Tower of the flock" and "hill of the daughter of Zion" point to Jerusalem, and both phrases perhaps evoke memories of David when he first captured and ruled the city. "Daughter of Zion" is a clear reference to Jerusalem elsewhere (e.g., Isa. 10:32), and "hill"—sometimes translated by the ESV as "Ophel"—refers to the hill

<span id="page-473-1"></span><span id="page-473-0"></span>between the original Davidic city (that is, Jerusalem when it was first conquered by David) and the temple built later (2 Chron. 27:3; 33:14). "Tower of the flock" is parallel to this, perhaps referring to a tower on (or very near to) that hill. Since towers could be defensive structures (Judg. 9:51), and "flock" is easily associated with David (the shepherd-king), this may be another allusion to David and hence a reminder of the promise of an eternal Davidic King. It is no surprise, then, that the end of the verse makes clear reference to Jerusalem's being restored to a place from which kingship will be exercised. In short, these allusions to David in the past suggest hope for the future, as the former Davidic kingdom will reemerge in Zion. The little flock will be led by a new Davidic Shepherd-King.

<span id="page-473-3"></span>4:9 If the first oracle predicts future Davidic leadership, the second oracle indicates absence of leadership in the present time. This is the force of the rhetorical questions, which are an implicit criticism of King Hezekiah and the Davidic dynasty. The nation has probably been decimated by the Assyrians in 701 BC, and Jerusalem is the last holdout. The acute pain the people of the city feel is compared to birth pangs seizing a pregnant woman.

<span id="page-473-4"></span>4:10 This verse continues the image of a woman in painful labor in order to describe the pain of conquest, capture, and exile to Babylon. (The actual exile to Babylon did not occur until about a hundred years later, in 586 BC, suggesting this is a long-range prophecy for Micah.) But these pangs will give birth to new life, as the exiles will be rescued and redeemed from their enemies by the Lord, their redeemer.

<span id="page-473-5"></span>4:11 The present crisis in which Jerusalem is surrounded shows the armies' desire to destroy Zion. The phrase "Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion" is well explained by Elizabeth Achtemeier: "The humiliation and defeat of Israel is often pictured in the terms of a woman stripped naked before her lovers or captors (cf. esp. Nah. 3:5, but also Isa. 47:3; Lam. 1:8; Ezek. 16:37 . . . )."32 It is humiliating and shameful defeat that these nations want to accomplish.

<span id="page-473-6"></span><span id="page-473-2"></span>4:12 But the nations—a metaphorical description of the Assyrian army and its many mercenaries—do not know that Yahweh has planned to thwart their intentions. He has actually gathered them as grain for the threshing floor. The tables will be turned!

<span id="page-473-7"></span>4:13 The prophet provides a long description of this dramatic reversal. The threshing image is continued with intensity here, as the daughter of Zion is compared to an ox with horns of iron and hooves of bronze. In antiquity—and even today such animals would help separate the wheat from the chaff by trampling the sheaves of grain on the threshing floor. Here Zion is an ox "on steroids," and the grain is the Assyrian army. At the end of this battle, the wealth of the nations will be "devoted" to the Lord. To devote the wealth of an enemy to God was often the

<sup>32</sup> Elizabeth Achtemeier, *Minor Prophets I* (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1996), 335.

<span id="page-474-0"></span>last action in holy war (cf. Josh. 6:17). This crushing defeat of the enemy and the salvation of Zion may refer to the withdrawal of Sennacherib and his army from Jerusalem in 701 BC. Whatever the exact battle, it is clear that ultimate power for victory comes from the fact that Zion is protected by the "Lord of the whole earth," the ultimate King and Savior.

<span id="page-474-5"></span><span id="page-474-2"></span><span id="page-474-1"></span>5:1 The command to muster troops to Judah must have seemed like a joke, with the Assyrian armies encamped just outside the gates of Jerusalem. In fact, the Assyrian emissary outside the walls of Zion taunted the people with a boast that he would give two thousand horses to Hezekiah if he could find the men to ride them (2 Kings 18:23). The humiliation of bypassing the king and his officials and going directly to the people of Jerusalem with an appeal to surrender must also have been a great disgrace—a slap on the face—to Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:26–27). Indeed, we read here in Micah 5:1 that the "judge" (*shopet*) of the city is struck on the face with a "rod" (*shebet*). The leader in view is likely Hezekiah, who is not even given the respect of the title "king." Moreover, to strike someone on the face was an act of extreme degradation (Job 16:10; Lam. 3:30). And while this passage is speaking of a metaphorical indignity (as opposed to Hezekiah's being literally struck), it is strong way of saying that the king is being treated by the enemy with great disrespect.

### <span id="page-474-3"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-474-4"></span>This text underscores through the beginning oracle (Mic. 4:8) that the future of the new kingdom is not in doubt, yet there will be fiery trials through which the seeds of the kingdom will have to pass before they can grow into a fruitful tree that gives life to the rest of the world. The present is in some ways a crucible of suffering: attack, conquest, captivity, exile, and humiliation. But this is not the last word. All of this suffering is compared to a pregnant woman in labor—it will finally end in the birth and joy of new life.

<span id="page-474-7"></span>Christian believers are in no way exempt from this type of suffering. One merely has to read about the lives of the early Christian apostles. All except one was reputed to have been martyred. Suffering became such a badge of Christian discipleship that Paul wrote to Timothy, "All who . . . live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted" (2 Tim. 3:12). Paul in fact used the image of the birth pangs associated with labor to describe the present suffering of both the entire creation and the believer, before the final glory will be revealed:

We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. (Rom. 8:22–23)

<span id="page-474-6"></span>Thus the present time, between the first and second coming of the Messiah, is often a time of suffering and exile, persecution and death. Christians often emphasize

<span id="page-475-2"></span><span id="page-475-1"></span>the victory and triumph of the Christian life, but the "already" of the kingdom should not be confused with the kingdom in all of its fullness and power. There is still the "not yet." Rather than being discouraged, believers must realize that their final victory will come, and they can hope in their faithful, covenant God in the midst of crisis. All of their enemies will one day be completely defeated, just as they are here in Micah. The suffering martyrs in the book of Revelation cry, "How long?" (Rev. 6:10), but someday their anguish will give way to a new world of God's glory, as the last adversaries—Satan, sin, and death—will be finally defeated by Jesus, the ultimate Shepherd-King (Rev. 19:11–21).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-476-4"></span><span id="page-476-3"></span>This new section has a structure similar to the previous one: both start with "you" (4:8; 5:2), and both continue to a series of oracles. But there are important differences. While the previous section described present suffering (4:8–5:1), this section anticipates the future (note the use of "shall" in 5:2–9) and explains why salvation from the present suffering is delayed (5:3).

## *Comment*

5:2 As in the previous section (cf. 4:8), this first oracle begins with a focus on the future Davidic kingdom (5:2–4) before moving to the events that will transpire before the end arrives (vv. 4–9).

<span id="page-476-8"></span><span id="page-476-5"></span><span id="page-476-2"></span><span id="page-476-1"></span><span id="page-476-0"></span>Whereas Zion was addressed as "you" in the previous section (4:8), the small town of Bethlehem is the addressee now (5:2). Its location is further clarified by the name "Ephrathah," which specifies the district in which the town was located, thus distinguishing it from another Bethlehem in the north (cf. Josh. 19:15). The insignificance of Bethlehem in the south is emphasized ("too little to be among the clans of Judah"). A "clan" was a large group of families, which combined with other such groups to form a tribe. The term is here used poetically for the town of Bethlehem, with a focus on the smallness of the city. It was so small and insignificant, in fact, that it did not appear in the list of forty-six cities in the tribe of Judah in Joshua 15:20–63. But it bore Davidic associations, as this was David's hometown, and the tribe of Judah had messianic links, as an ancient prophecy predicted that a universal ruler would emerge from this tribe (Gen. 49:8–12). The reference to a ruler over Israel in Micah 5:2 is a direct echo of the prophecy of a future heir

<span id="page-477-2"></span><span id="page-477-1"></span>for David, who would come (2 Sam. 7:12) from his body and establish an eternal kingdom (2 Sam. 7:13–14). Thus this particular individual, whose "coming forth is from of old" is now the object of Micah's prophecy.

<span id="page-477-6"></span>5:3 But the birth of this Davidic King must wait until the nation is given over to its enemies: "He [that is, the Lord] shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth." There must be a delay. But when the King is born, there will be a new unity among the people of God.

<span id="page-477-7"></span>5:4 The might and power of this new King are emphasized, as well as his universal rule. He stands—not sits—and actively shepherds his people. This reference to the King's acting as a shepherd was a common motif in the ancient Near East. The Egyptian pharaohs were often depicted carrying a shepherd's staff; in one building inscription Pharaoh Sesostris I states, "He begat me to do what should be done for him, to accomplish what he commands to do, He appointed me shepherd of this land, knowing him who would herd it for him."33 Similarly, the prologue to the Code of Hammurabi portrays the king as a shepherd of his people:

I am the salvation-bearing shepherd, whose staff is straight, the good shadow that is spread over my city; on my breast I cherish the inhabitants of the land of Sumer and Akkad; in my shelter I have let them repose in peace; in my deep wisdom have I enclosed them.34

The shepherd was thus a symbol of power and salvation.

<span id="page-477-5"></span><span id="page-477-0"></span>Significantly, however, this King will shepherd not in his own strength but in the strength of God. The majesty of God will overwhelm any potential threats to the flock (cf. Ex. 15:7; Isa. 2:10), resulting in the security of the people. Their safety is a clear echo of the promise of a time in which the temple will be exalted in the last days and every person will dwell without fear under his own vine and fig tree (Mic. 4:4). Moreover, just as the temple was pictured as elevated to the supreme place in the world (4:1), the new King will be "great to the ends of the earth" (5:4). Thus temple and King will dominate the universe. It is clear that in some way the temple's elevation and the King's elevation will coincide, and the King's rule will extend to the rest of the world.

<span id="page-477-8"></span><span id="page-477-4"></span>5:5 "He shall be their peace" could also be translated, "He will be the one of peace." This suggests a formal title for an agent of peace, with ancient Near Eastern precedent for this use of the phrase.35 Micah's contemporary Isaiah lists a similar title for this King, calling him the "Prince of Peace" (Isa. 9:6).

<span id="page-477-3"></span>This announcement of future peace prefaces the Assyrian threat. Assyria probably refers not only to the nation of Assyria—the clear and present danger in Micah's time—but also by extension to other enemies of God. Thus these enemies

who have invaded Judah will have the tables turned on them, and many shepherds from Judah will be raised against them. The formula "seven shepherds . . . eight princes" is a poetic way of describing a large number of leaders. The rule of the one shepherd will produce the rule of many against his enemies.

<span id="page-478-5"></span>5:6 These shepherds will "shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its entrances." "At its entrances" should perhaps be translated "with its drawn sword" (NIV); this involves only a slight change in the Hebrew and makes for smoother parallelism. "Land of Nimrod" is another term for Assyria, highlighting that it was a land noted for titanic defiance, as Nimrod was the builder of the ancient Tower of Babel (Gen. 10:9–10). But it does not matter how strong they are; they are no match for the King of Peace, to which the text now returns. It is "he" (the King) who will deliver the people when "he" (the Assyrian) attacks the land.

<span id="page-478-6"></span><span id="page-478-4"></span><span id="page-478-0"></span>5:7 In contrast to the strength of Assyria, the scene shifts to the scattered remnant, which is lame and crippled (4:6–7) among the nations. Despite this weakness, the remnant will be a boon to the nations, like refreshing dew and showers of rain. Just as the onset of the dew and rain does not wait for human consent, nor is it delayed by human will, so this refreshment for the nations will assuredly come. Interestingly, one of the first references to dew in Scripture is found in a blessing upon the patriarch Jacob (Gen. 27:28). The dew of heaven would pour down on him, with one consequence being that he would be a blessing to those who blessed him (Gen. 27:29). The Jacob who would become a cripple was called to be a blessing. The nature of this blessing suggests that, just as dew's appearing is irrevocable, God's blessing upon his people is irrevocable.

<span id="page-478-7"></span><span id="page-478-2"></span><span id="page-478-1"></span>5:8 The remnant will also be a bane to the nations that oppose them. The survivors will be like a raging lion who will ravage and rend in ferocity and strength. This text echoes the patriarchal blessing upon Judah to be like a lion who would rule the nations (Gen. 49:8–12).

<span id="page-478-8"></span><span id="page-478-3"></span>5:9 This verse may also be translated as a prayer for the remnant: "May your hand be lifted up over your adversaries, and may all your enemies be cut off." In either case, it is clear that the Lord is the one who will do so. Indeed, "cut off" becomes the leading word in the next major oracle (v. 10); the Lord has indeed brought it to pass.

## <span id="page-478-9"></span>*Response*

The birth of the Shepherd-King is clearly a turning point, showing his lowly beginnings and his gradual dominion. His dominion does not come about all at once, yet it results in the destruction of Israel's great enemy, Assyria, which has clearly become a symbol of evil, as it is called the Land of Nimrod, a place of primeval rebellion against God. The birth of this Shepherd-King results in the sending of shepherds to this land of evil to conquer it.

<span id="page-479-3"></span><span id="page-479-2"></span>The birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem is seen in the NT as the clear fulfillment of this prophecy, indicating that he is the Shepherd-King who will bring peace to the world (Matt. 2:6–7). Coming amid incredible suffering and evil, Jesus' birth demonstrates that Israel's long exilic existence is finally coming to an end. Jesus reconstitutes Israel by his choice of twelve disciples, who represent the twelve tribes. This is a remnant and the nucleus of a new nation (Matt. 10:1–4). Moreover, this new King of Israel reigns from a cross, and through his death and resurrection he is the peacemaker par excellence, bringing peace between God and humanity (Rom. 5:1–2) and between races and enemies (Eph. 2:14–22). But he is not only the peacemaker; he is also the Good Shepherd who even gives his life for the sheep (John 10:1–16). He is the Chief Shepherd who will appear at the last day to bring an end to history (1 Pet. 5:4), as peace and righteousness will be established unto the ends of the earth (Mic. 5:4; 2 Pet. 3:13).

<span id="page-479-7"></span><span id="page-479-6"></span><span id="page-479-5"></span><span id="page-479-4"></span><span id="page-479-0"></span>The church needs to realize that it need not fear its enemy; as a result of the command of its Shepherd-King, even the gates of hell (e.g., Assyria) will not be able to withstand its attack. It also needs to remember that the gospel is an aroma of God to two types of people: a fragrance of death to those who continue in their sin, but one of life to those who repent (2 Cor. 2:15–16). It is the task of the church to be a dew of blessing wherever it goes among the nations, but it is also to be an implacable foe of evil. It is clear, however, that whatever success it has is a result of divine empowerment. In a very real sense the little remnant is a messianic community, in which the Spirit of the Shepherd-King is exerting his will and power.

## <span id="page-479-1"></span>MICAH 5:10–15

- **<sup>10</sup>** And in that day, declares the Lord, I will cut off your horses from among you and will destroy your chariots;
- **<sup>11</sup>** and I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds;
- **<sup>12</sup>** and I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more tellers of fortunes;
- **<sup>13</sup>** and I will cut off your carved images and your pillars from among you, and you shall bow down no more to the work of your hands;
- **<sup>14</sup>** and I will root out your Asherah images from among you and destroy your cities.
- **<sup>15</sup>** And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance on the nations that did not obey.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-480-5"></span><span id="page-480-4"></span>The formulaic beginning "In that day, declares the Lord" clearly links this oracle with its companion in 4:6–7, with exactly the same terminology beginning both sections. Thus this final oracle represents the completion of the entire section (4:6–5:15), which is essentially detailing how the temple will become the supreme and central place in the world, where the will of God will be paramount and peace will reign. Thus there is now a shift from the remnant and a prayer for the destruction of enemies, to a final answer to that prayer: the destruction of everything that is in implacable opposition to God. Indeed, the word "destroy" is the dominating theme of this entire text (5:10–15). Verbs indicating destruction occur eight times in these six verses, recurring with great rapidity and intensity in order to convey comprehensive destruction.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-480-6"></span><span id="page-480-3"></span><span id="page-480-2"></span>5:10 "That day" is connected with the general end of history (4:1, 6). The first thing "that day" ushers in is the destruction of horses and chariots, important offensive weapons in the arsenals of ancient nations. This focus on chariots recalls the military city of Lachish, which first taught Judah to sin (1:13) by spawning excessive trust in military power. Placing trust in horses and chariots was always a temptation for ancient Israel (Ps. 20:7).

<span id="page-480-7"></span><span id="page-480-1"></span>5:11 There is a shift here from offensive weapons to defensive fortifications. The "cities" here are probably fortified cities, as the parallel "strongholds" makes clear. The word for "stronghold" suggests inaccessibility, as such a place was fenced or walled off in order to provide security. Lachish was a formidable stronghold, as it boasted two surrounding walls for extra fortification. Such walls, which were sometimes 30 feet (9 m) thick and over 20 feet (6 m) high, would seem impregnable and would tempt people to trust in *them* rather than in the living God. But these will not protect anyone when *God* comes to destroy such illusions.

<span id="page-480-8"></span><span id="page-480-0"></span>5:12 There is now a shift from destroying objects of military strength to destroying objects and practices of false worship; in both cases the Lord is tearing down that in which the people are wrongly trusting. In ancient Israel, sorcerers and fortune-tellers represented illicit ways of determining the future or accessing the divine (Deut. 18:10–14). Such practices were condemned, since they demonstrated a lack of trust in God's will and his Word. Sorcerers may have manipulated devices in their hands in practicing their craft, but such instruments would be "cut off" from their hands. All such methods of false trust will come to an end.

<span id="page-481-5"></span><span id="page-481-1"></span>5:13 Yahweh will then destroy all idols. Thus the destruction of all the idols in Samaria (1:7) was but a prelude to the destruction of all idolatry. The idols may have represented male gods and their consorts. The male god ("carved images") may have been represented by an upright stone, and the female god by a wooden pole or tree ("pillars"), representing fertility.

<span id="page-481-6"></span><span id="page-481-0"></span>5:14 Asherah was the name of a female fertility goddess, often depicted by a tree (cf. Deut. 16:21) as a symbol of life. Recent archaeological evidence documents these practices from Micah's time, and these idolatrous customs are particularly linked with "cities."36

<span id="page-481-7"></span><span id="page-481-3"></span>5:15 After a complete destruction of all of the objects of false trust, the pathway will be cleared for the proclamation of peace to the nations. The temple will be exalted and Yahweh will hold supreme sway. Many of the nations will come and meet Yahweh and transform their spears and swords into pruning hooks and plows (cf. 4:3). But for those who will not, judgment awaits. The word for "vengeance" indicates a judicial decision by the sovereign Lord in accord with his character as a just ruler. Without such final action his rule would be marred by injustice and chaos.37

#### *Response*

The final work of the Messiah is depicted here. In order to bring peace to the world, he will use violence—not for the sake of violence itself but because sometimes violent injustice may be ended only with violent justice. "God's use of violence, inevitable in a violent world, is intended to subvert human violence in order to bring the creation along to a point where violence is no more."38

<span id="page-481-4"></span>This text, and this whole section in which it is embedded, also stresses the importance of complete trust in Yahweh. It describes how items of false hope, whether in terms of military might (5:10–11) or of idolatry (5:12–14), will be utterly destroyed. It also emphasizes that salvation will come only through Yahweh (4:1–5, 6–7, 8–10, 11–13; 5:1–4, 5–6, 7, 8, 9–14). It is thus complete folly to trust in anything or anyone else.39

<span id="page-481-2"></span>The Christian church is always in danger of trusting in its own strength (budgets, programs, strategies), seeking wisdom and knowledge from extrabiblical sources (pundits, politicians, and experts), or replacing the living God with idols (leaders, buildings, traditions). But these represent a failure to trust in the living God and his Holy Spirit. For the church to be an effective witness to the outside world, it always stands in need of reformation. The NT makes it clear that God disciplines his church in order to refine it, that it might be the light it needs to be, to shine amid the surrounding world. Thus, e.g., Corinthian believers were

Indeed, some of the last words of Jesus to his churches in Revelation are words of rebuke and discipline (Rev. 2:4, 14–16; 3:19). These churches were to be lights shining in the dark to a needy world (Rev. 1:20), but Christ threatened to remove them unless they repented (Rev. 2:5). With repentance and reformation, however, they could become beacons lighting up the darkness, waiting in hope for that day in which God's light would light up the entire world (Rev. 21:23).

## <span id="page-482-1"></span>OVERVIEW OF MICAH 6:1–7:20

This final section intensifies and amplifies Micah's central theme of judgment and salvation. The indictments are no longer aimed at individual groups within the nation but rather are directed to the people as a whole. The nation has utterly missed the entire point of being Yahweh's people. They have not realized that Yahweh has saved them for a life of relationship with him (walking with him), loving mercy and practicing justice. They have mistakenly thought they could show extraordinary faith by making one-time sacrifices instead of by living a life of love and service.

It begins with an argument with the people to show the main point of their calling from God: fellowship with him, love, and justice (6:1–8). It then demonstrates that they have kept fellowship with notorious kings instead of with God, and their lives are marked by violence instead of love, injustice instead of justice (6:9–16). This leads to a natural consequence: the entire society is corrupt and thus ripe for judgment (7:1–7). Finally, from this lament over the totality and reality of corruption, the prophet personifies the nation as he confesses and acknowledges sin and hopes in God and his sure promises (7:8–20). This last composition contains themes from each part of the book, using them to produce a resounding crescendo of salvation.

## *Section Overview*

This text is a classic representative of what scholars call a "covenant lawsuit." A key Hebrew word marking such a genre is "case/indictment" (*rib*; 6:1–2). The prophets used this genre to show that Yahweh had a legal case against Israel. In this genre, the prophets often took the role of prosecutors, while Israel was the defendant. Here, creation itself is called as witness (vv. 1–2), and the reason for the case is laid out: God's people have become weary with him despite his being utterly

<span id="page-484-8"></span><span id="page-484-0"></span>faithful and wonderful to them (vv. 3–5). To the lawsuit is added a text fashioned like an "entrance liturgy" to the temple (vv. 6–8; cf. Psalms 15; 24), indicating the requirements of correct worship—what God really desires. These requirements are expressed both negatively, in terms of what he does not want (Mic. 6:6–7), and positively, in terms of what he desires (v. 8).

## <span id="page-484-9"></span><span id="page-484-6"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-484-3"></span>6:1 Micah is told to plead his case against the people of God, while the most enduring elements of reality, the ancient mountains and hills, are enlisted as witnesses. Micah is in the role of a prosecutor, and God is the Judge. There has been much talk of courts and corruption in Micah (3:1–4, 9–11), but here finally is the "supreme court."

<span id="page-484-4"></span><span id="page-484-1"></span>6:2 Micah now calls the mountains and the everlasting foundations of the earth to the witness stand. This stress on the mountains, which are the heights of creation, along with the everlasting foundations, which are its depths, suggests that all of inanimate creation is being called to hear Yahweh's case against his people. The Hebrew word for "contend" was last used when the nations would meet Yahweh in the temple in the last days, leading to their transformation ("shall decide"; 4:3). It is a word with a legal background, suggesting debate in court, accusation, and conviction (cf. "lodging a charge against"; 6:2, NIV).

<span id="page-484-5"></span><span id="page-484-2"></span>6:3 The vocative "O my people," positioned at the front of the sentence, shows the emotion of Yahweh for his people, as well as his love for them. It points to exasperation, which the rest of the sentence intensifies. Yahweh is presented not so much as being angry with his people but rather as being confused. He wants to know what he has done to make them feel so weary with him. Somehow, his liberating them from Egypt (cf. v. 4) has become a heavy burden for them to bear. The command "Answer me!" is an eruption of frustration.

<span id="page-484-7"></span>6:4 This sentence explicitly contradicts the people's view; the Hebrew verbal expression "I brought you up" (*heʻelitika*) sounds like "I wearied you" (*hel'etika*) but has a totally different meaning. God did not weary them (v. 3)—he liberated them (v. 4)! Moreover, he provided guidance for them in the wilderness through the political leadership of Moses, the priestly authority of Aaron, and the prophetic direction of Miriam.

<span id="page-485-9"></span><span id="page-485-5"></span><span id="page-485-3"></span><span id="page-485-2"></span>6:5 The vocative "O my people" again stresses Yahweh's emotional intensity. He commands them to remember his final actions for them, which included deliverance from the occult specialist Balaam, hired by Balak, the Moabite king, to curse them when they were on the verge of entering the Promised Land (Numbers 22– 24). "Shittim" represents the last place where Israel settled outside the Promised Land (Num. 25:1; Josh. 2:1), and "Gilgal" the point of entry into the Promised Land (Josh. 4:19). The names together are thus a "summary of sacred history, lead[ing] from Exodus to conquest, from promise to fulfillment."40 Thus God has brought about the exodus, guided and delivered them in the wilderness, and led them victoriously in the conquest of the land, all done so that Israel might know the "righteous acts of the Lord."

<span id="page-485-10"></span>6:6–7 A series of questions indicates Yahweh's expectations for his people in light of his righteous acts on their behalf. The first pair of questions asks about the proper approach to Yahweh (v. 6a). They raise the perennial question of how to worship him properly. The term "bow myself" is a rare word, used mainly for individuals' groveling on the ground as a result of unfortunate circumstances (Pss. 57:6; 145:14; 146:8). But here it means proper deference before the Creator. He is described as "God on high," which occurs only here in the Bible and stresses God's transcendence.

<span id="page-485-11"></span><span id="page-485-8"></span>The next three pairs of questions are rhetorical. They escalate in intensity and are presented as answers to the question concerning the proper approach to Yahweh (Mic. 6:6b–7). The first pair of questions addresses burnt offerings (v. 6b), which were the most costly offering, since the entire animal was consumed in the fire and the worshiper received no portion. Year-old calves were the most valuable burnt offering, since their meat was the most tender. The answer to this pair of questions is obviously negative.

<span id="page-485-12"></span><span id="page-485-7"></span>The next pair mentions "thousands of rams" (v. 7a), which is clearly hyperbole, being far more than anyone but a king could afford (cf. 1 Kings 3:4; 8:63). "Ten thousands of rivers of oil" is further hyperbole, as oil was never used as an offering on its own. It functioned as a component of offerings; e.g., it was used in grain offerings, mixed with the flour or grain (Lev. 2:1–3, 15–16), and also for anointing rites (1 Sam. 10:1; Ps. 45:7). But such vast quantities suggested here were impossible to bring. Again the answer to this set of questions is negative.

<span id="page-485-13"></span><span id="page-485-6"></span><span id="page-485-4"></span><span id="page-485-0"></span>Finally, the most valuable gift possible is envisioned in the last, climactic pair of questions (Mic. 6:7b). "Firstborn" represents the special child that breaks open the womb and is the first sign of his father's strength. It therefore had a special status in ancient Israel, and the firstborn male child held a double portion of the inheritance (Deut. 21:17). He represented the future of the worshiper. The idea of atonement for sin is introduced here, for the assumption is that no one can approach God without a sacrifice for sin. But the answer to this last set of questions is also clearly negative—as the Lord made clear on numerous occasions by condemning the sacrifice of children (Lev. 18:21; Jer. 7:31; Ezek. 16:20–21).

<span id="page-485-1"></span><sup>40</sup> Delbert R. Hillers, *Micah: A Commentary on the Prophet Micah*, Hermeneia (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1984), 78.

Moreover, as Micah now makes clear, even if the religious rites were approved by the law, they could never accomplish atonement if they were not accompanied by a heart seeking to be faithful to the Lord's commands.

<span id="page-486-7"></span><span id="page-486-6"></span><span id="page-486-5"></span>6:8 In response to the three sets of expected negative answers, Micah now gives three positive answers, each also in escalating intensity. Yahweh requires the worshiper first to "do justice." The same expression occurs in Proverbs 21:15: "When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers." A similar phrase is found in Proverbs 21:7: "The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, because they refuse to do what is just." To do justice is often to help someone in need, i.e., to be an advocate for one whose rights are being violated. Thus God is the ultimate just one, as he champions the cause of the widow and orphan and all who are oppressed (Deut. 10:18; Ps. 146:7). Solomon practiced justice by vindicating the rights of a prostitute, returning her stolen child (1 Kings 3:27–28). Thus justice is something that one primarily *does*. The word "justice" often occurs together with the word "righteousness," and together they point to the practice of justice in society (Gen. 18:19; Ps. 33:5; Prov. 21:3).41 One must be committed to helping those in need.

<span id="page-486-4"></span><span id="page-486-3"></span><span id="page-486-1"></span>Second, one is to "love kindness." This combination of verb and noun is unique in the OT, as the pious are usually described as *having* or *doing* kindness.42 The Hebrew word translated "kindness" is difficult to translate, as it connotes a range of ideas, such as "loyalty," "mercy," "fidelity," "steadfast love," or "loving kindness." It usually signifies help provided by a stronger to a weaker partner in a covenant relationship (the covenant relationship not always being necessary). To "love kindness" thus implies that helping someone in need should occupy a central place in one's heart and affections. Practicing justice is something that one does, but a lover of kindness is something that one *is*, and being the latter will surely result in doing the former. One does not help others primarily out of a sense of duty but because of a genuine desire to help.

<span id="page-486-0"></span>Third, the greatest requirement is to walk humbly with God. This indicates genuine fellowship, as seen in the lives of others who walked with God, such as Noah (Gen. 6:9) and Abraham (Gen. 17:1). To walk with God is to accept his vision and values for life, to fellowship with him. Thus one does this humbly, recognizing one's place before God on high.

There is clearly an inextricable link between these three requirements.43 As one walks humbly with God, one begins to love kindness and then to practice justice.

The phrase "to love kindness" does occur five times in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where it refers to neighborly love (Community Rule: 2:24; 5:4, 25; 8:2; 10:26).

they could live for themselves and practice injustice. He did all these things so that they would know his righteous acts and begin to embody them in their lives. One-time offerings—even outlandish ones—totally missed the point if they were not accompanied by a life of fellowship with God and love for neighbor. God did not save a people so that they could be merely outwardly religious; he saved them to walk in close fellowship with him and to be his agents of mercy and love in the world.

Christians today must reflect carefully on this. Too often, we think that simply saying a sinner's prayer—a one-time commitment to the Lord at some point in our lives—is all that matters. Past moments of decision are of course important, but what the Lord calls us to is wholehearted obedience in the present. It is faithful living, not one-time religious deeds, that the Lord requires. Jesus rejected even spectacular works for God such as prophesying in his name, casting out demons, and doing many other mighty works if they were not accompanied by obedience (Matt. 7:22). In the end, it is all about getting to know Yahweh, acquiring his heart of steadfast love and kindness, and doing justice in the world. These are not oneoff acts but a total life commitment.

<span id="page-487-2"></span>This should make us ask, "What is our church concerned with?" Some churches may be concerned with fine performances of music, eloquent homilies by distinguished orators, or the magnificent art captured in stained glass displays. For other churches, the concerns might be centered more on quality praise and worship, large numbers in attendance, the ministry of the Spirit, or the hip pastor/speaker with a glass lectern and a bottle of Sierra Springs. There is nothing wrong with these things in and of themselves, but what of the concerns mentioned in Micah 6:8? Where do these fit? If someone challenges us with a concern for social justice and the poor, are we tempted to reply, "Stick to religious topics! Don't talk about everyday matters. Remain in the sacred realm where God's name is adored"?44 Micah would rebuke us vehemently. So would Jesus!

<span id="page-487-4"></span><span id="page-487-3"></span><span id="page-487-1"></span><span id="page-487-0"></span>When Jesus Christ laid down his life for his people, he did so in order that they could be filled with his Spirit and live a new life in which love, joy, peace, and other virtues pulsate through their lives (Gal. 5:22–23). Thus his people are called to be the body of Christ in the world (1 Corinthians 12), his feet and hands that bring and minister God's grace and peace, clothe the naked, welcome the stranger, visit the prisoner, and give a cup of cold water in Jesus' name, all flowing from a deep faith in Christ and what he has done (Matt. 5:42; cf. 25:31–45).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-488-0"></span>This judgment oracle is closely linked to the previous unit, as its indictment (6:9–12, 16a) details transgressions against the specific requirements of God (v. 8). Instead of walking with God, the people have walked with Omri and Ahab; instead of loving kindness, they have loved violence; instead of practicing justice, they have cheated and stolen. Thus they are sentenced to complete and utter futility (vv. 13–15) and the desolation of exile (v. 16b).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-489-5"></span>6:9 The new oracle begins as the previous one did, with an appeal to listen as the voice of Yahweh calls out to the "city," probably referring to Jerusalem and its inhabitants, who represent Judah as a whole. Wisdom terminology is used here, focusing on practical success as a result of fearing Yahweh and listening to correction, even if it comes with the rod. Micah is suggesting that some of the judgment the people have experienced is the rod of Yahweh (Isa. 10:5; cf. Prov. 13:24; 22:15; 23:13–14), who seeks to bring about correction in the lives of the people. Isaiah makes similar remarks but is much more explicit (Isa. 1:5–6).

<span id="page-489-6"></span><span id="page-489-3"></span><span id="page-489-2"></span><span id="page-489-1"></span>6:10 The current Hebrew text reads, "Are there still in the house of the wicked treasures of wickedness?" A slight change in the vowels of the Hebrew leads to the ESV translation, "Can I forget . . ." The result is the same: a rhetorical question pointing out the obvious, that the wicked city includes many households hoarding unjustly acquired wealth. Another rhetorical question continues, literally, "Is not the scant [lean] ephah accursed?" An ephah represented about one bushel in dry measure and was often used to measure wheat. Merchants in Israel were forbidden to have unjust measures, although unscrupulous merchants would often have a small bushel to dispense products (giving the buyer less than what they paid for) and a large measure to receive payment (taking more than what the buyer owed).

<span id="page-489-7"></span><span id="page-489-0"></span>6:11 The critique of such dishonesty is continued with a two-part rhetorical question bringing the sequence to a climax: "Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful weights?" The answer is clearly no; to the Lord, such measures are unjust and an outright abomination (Deut. 25:13–16). The prophet Amos referred to this practice in the northern kingdom a few years before Micah, quoting similarly unjust merchants:

 When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may offer wheat for sale, that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great and deal deceitfully with false balances? (Amos 8:5)

<span id="page-489-4"></span>Yahweh will not exonerate those guilty of using false measures—how could he do so and still be a God of justice?

<span id="page-489-8"></span>6:12 Yahweh continues his indictment by switching from rhetorical questions to direct confrontation, demonstrating that the injustice in the marketplace is a reflection of the culture. The rich are full of violence, i.e., their wealth has been gained by cheating and hurting people. As for the residents of the city, they speak lies because their tongues—the very organs of speech—are deceitful!

<span id="page-490-4"></span>6:13 The image of the rod of correction appears again as Yahweh promises to smite his people with a sharp blow. While this text is envisioning a future judgment, the signs of judgment may have already begun in the form of initial forays of the Assyrian army into the land of Judah.

<span id="page-490-5"></span>6:14 This verse introduces the particular sentence of punishment rendered by Yahweh; verse 15 will continue it. The people are seeking to acquire wealth by unjust means but will not succeed in their goal. Thus the following judgments are often called "futility curses." The first curse deals with food: hunger will never be satisfied, nor will food stored away provide any relief, as it will finally be given to the sword. Siege conditions are likely in view here. What kind of satisfaction can there be when the city is surrounded by a foreign army?

<span id="page-490-6"></span>6:15 The source of the food now comes into view. Wheat, oil from olive trees, and grapes will not be enjoyed because most of these would have been planted outside the walls of the city, where the besieged would have had no access. Even though they planted them, they would not reap them.

<span id="page-490-7"></span><span id="page-490-2"></span>6:16 Both sentence and judgment are summarized with different words than in verses 9–15. The people have not walked with Yahweh and in his statutes; instead they have kept the statutes of Omri and the work of Ahab. These two kings, father and son, were notorious in the northern kingdom for apostasy and injustice. Although they were successful politically, they were disasters morally, introducing Baal worship into Israel through the marriage of Ahab to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess who brought with her a religious entourage of prophets of Baal and his consort, Astarte. This resulted in great persecution of Yahweh's prophets, as exemplified in some of the Elijah narratives (1 Kings 17–18); and in horrific injustice, as illustrated in the story of Naboth's vineyard (1 Kings 21). Consequently, the people will be given over to desolation (cf. Mic. 6:10) and to the derision of the nations. (Instead of "You shall bear the scorn of my people," a slight change in the Hebrew leads to "You shall bear the scorn of peoples," which perhaps makes better sense in the context.45)

## <span id="page-490-3"></span><span id="page-490-1"></span><span id="page-490-0"></span>*Response*

This oracle is inextricably linked to the previous one. The people have been redeemed by Yahweh for a life of walking in his Torah, loving mercy, and practicing justice, but it is clear that they have walked in the ways of Omri and Ahab instead, loving violence, practicing injustice, and lying. The result will be futility and desolation.

This text clarifies one concrete realm of justice and injustice: the use of money. When people cheat in their businesses and professions, they are guilty of injustice,

<sup>45</sup> The Septuagint also supports this reading.

and this functions like a plague, creating an unjust society. Thus this text speaks clearly to contemporary believers of the importance of "walking the talk," of a life of faith accompanied by good works. Paul had to warn believers in Corinth about the inconsistency of claiming salvation by Christ but living a life according to the dictates of the sinful nature, not according to the Spirit:

You yourselves wrong and defraud—even your own brothers! Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor. 6:8–10)

<span id="page-491-2"></span><span id="page-491-0"></span>Those who have been redeemed by Christ are to walk not in the ways of the world but in the ways of God. The law of Christ is a new commandment to love. In a sense it is the same commandment that has been given in the law, to love one's neighbor as oneself (Lev. 19:18), but it is new in the sense that there has been a new redeeming act (the love of Christ as manifested in the cross) and a new redeeming power (the gift of the Holy Spirit).

<span id="page-491-5"></span><span id="page-491-4"></span><span id="page-491-3"></span>The idea of discipline to instruct the faithful who have strayed from the path of holiness is not merely an OT truth but is also an NT reality. The children of God, says the writer to the Hebrews, are disciplined precisely because they are children. If they were not God's children, there would be no need for correction (Heb. 12:5–11). Paul had to warn the Corinthian church that many of its members were suffering because they were participating in the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner (1 Cor. 11:30). But he also uses this as a reminder that they are to examine themselves (1 Cor. 11:28, 31), that is, to make sure that they are following Christ's commands and thus not putting themselves in a position where such discipline is required. The Lord has created us not for discipline but for walking with him in his ways and knowing the love and joy of our Father.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-492-2"></span>This lament uses agrarian imagery to describe the total moral desolation of the nation. It describes a society that has experienced moral and spiritual collapse (7:1–4). God had expected a rich harvest of righteousness from his people but received absolutely nothing. No one can be trusted (vv. 5–6). In response, the prophet turns in absolute despair to the only one who is worthy of trust: the Lord God (v. 7).

## <span id="page-492-3"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-492-1"></span><span id="page-492-0"></span>7:1 The prophet represents the nation here when he laments for himself. Agrarian images are used to describe the barrenness of the land: there is no fruit to be gathered, no clusters of grapes in the vineyard, no figs on the fig trees. Although it is harvest time, there is nothing but desolation. As becomes clear in the next verse, this represents the moral barrenness of the nation. The prophet Isaiah used a similar image—God made a vineyard and looked for a harvest, but only rotten grapes were produced (Isa. 5:1–7). In Micah, there are not even rotten grapes.

<span id="page-493-7"></span><span id="page-493-6"></span><span id="page-493-3"></span>7:2 The point of the agrarian metaphor is clarified. The godly person has perished from the land. "Godly" (*hasid* ) comes from the same root that describes the quality God desires in people: kindness (*hesed*; cf. 6:8). The word "perish" suggests a negative connotation. A similar passage in Isaiah describes the righteous and the godly being swept away in a tide of evil (Isa. 57:1). The absence of the righteous leads to the proliferation of evil, as people stalk one another, seeking to hunt them down and kill them like wild animals. "Each hunts the other with a net" is literally "Each hunts his *brother* with a net." There is no idea of being a brother's keeper here, just his killer.

<span id="page-493-8"></span><span id="page-493-0"></span>7:3 Micah further describes the godless state of the land, including its corrupt leadership: the judicial and royal officials are interested not in justice and equitable rule but in making money from their positions through bribes. The "great man" may be a reference to the king (cf. 2 Sam. 3:38) or to distinguished nobility, who reveal their evil desires. Previously, they would at least keep their desires hidden because of shame; now they have no shame. "They weave it together" summarizes the situation: the leadership of the country is bound together in an intricate web of evil.

<span id="page-493-9"></span><span id="page-493-4"></span>7:4 The metaphor now reverts to the agrarian world. Instead of ripe fruit, the "best" of the nation are like thorns and briars. Instead of producing nourishment, they merely cause pain. Consequently, the nation can expect only judgment: "the day of your watchmen" indicates what the sentinels on the walls of cities see as judgment approaches. This is further defined as "your punishment," or visitation of judgment, which indicates an appointed time of divine judgment (cf. Amos 3:2, 14). Panic and confusion will ensue. The Hebrew word for "confusion" occurs only one another time in Scripture, in a telling text from Micah's contemporary, Isaiah, where it refers to the approaching demise of Jerusalem by the Assyrian army and the resultant "tumult and trampling [down] and confusion . . . a battering down of walls and a shouting" (Isa. 22:5). The panic is palpable.

<span id="page-493-10"></span><span id="page-493-5"></span><span id="page-493-2"></span>7:5 Consequently, in order to survive the coming crisis the prophet commands the people not to trust one another. Three categories of people are mentioned, in increasing level of relationship: neighbors, close friends or intimates (those who have been known a long time and therefore would normally be trusted; cf. Ps. 55:14), and wives.

<span id="page-493-11"></span><span id="page-493-1"></span>7:6 Such people can no longer be trusted because even the most intimate ties have been fractured: children despise their parents, and servants—"men of his own house"—despise masters, so that the household, which ought to be the haven of utmost security, becomes a place of danger and even war.

<span id="page-493-12"></span>7:7 In contrast to the nation, in which no one can be trusted, Yahweh is utterly reliable. "In a world where even neighbor and family are not to be trusted (vv. 5f.), <span id="page-494-0"></span>only God is left. But *he* is there."46 There is thus hope, but it is a hope beyond anyone or anything found in the nation. Micah has learned in his nation's descent to the moral abyss what the prophet Jonah experienced in his own descent to the bottom of the sea: salvation comes only from the Lord (Jonah 2:9). Micah's final words on behalf of the nation are that God would hear his prayer. This prayer will be the subject of the last passage of the book (Mic. 7:8–20).

### <span id="page-494-1"></span>*Response*

The times of Micah read like the headlines of contemporary newspapers regarding failed states, where might determines what is right. But at a deeper, spiritual level, there are many places in the so-called high society of the Western world where human beings are treated like commodities, where bribery is common, where the murder rates of cities skyrocket, where terrorists look for "soft targets" to kill as many people as possible, where human traffickers search for unsuspecting young women and children, and where some businesses exploit people for greed. The human tragedy of the mass migration of peoples to Europe in recent years is one of the saddest commentaries of modern life, as leaders struggle to determine the best way to handle both the migrant crisis and the underlying factors precipitating it. Pastors and spiritual leaders must realize that the Bible is never out of date; the prophets often hold up a mirror for societies and cultures to see their true selves.

<span id="page-494-3"></span><span id="page-494-2"></span>But even when human society has degenerated to such an extent, all hope is not lost. Micah's last word in this lament points to the ultimate solution: amid such corruption, human beings must look only to the Lord to hear their cry. Micah's "pessimism, in spite of everything, drives our prophet not to despair but into the arms of God."47 There is no safer place. Thus the prophetic message is ultimately one of hope because of the living God. In the Christian church there is a new culture founded on the cross, on the stretched-out arms of God, who has become a curse for sinners that we might receive a blessing (Gal. 3:13–14). Now, in the power of the Spirit, a new family thrives, in which "obedience is thicker than blood" (Matt. 12:48–50 MESSAGE). Love now rules in the family!

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-496-3"></span><span id="page-496-2"></span>This final text, which seems to be a type of prophetical liturgy,48 is a fitting conclusion to the entire book as it moves from lament to final praise and describes the success of God's salvific plan for the world. Israel's enemies will be defeated, including, most of all, her own sin (Mic. 7:8–9, 10; cf. v. 20); the nation will be restored and will become a magnet of hope for the nations (vv. 11–13); the people will experience an exodus-like salvation and will be guided into the land by the divine Shepherd (vv. 14–15); and the nations themselves will be subdued and come to worship Yahweh (vv. 16–17). Exodus language describing the incomparability of God is used to provide a final, stunning vision of God's grace and forgiveness (7:18–20).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-496-1"></span>7:8 Micah again represents the nation as he challenges his enemy not to rejoice. The identity of this enemy is not clear; it could be the Assyrians, the Babylonians, or perhaps the nations in general (cf. 4:10–13; 5:9). Assyria has been the great enemy

<span id="page-496-0"></span><sup>48</sup> Hermann Gunkel, "The Close of Micah: A Prophetic Liturgy," in Hermann Gunkel, *What Remains of the Old Testament and Other Essays* (London: Macmillan, 1928), 115–149.

The just judgment of God is not the end but the beginning of life, for though the nation falls, it will rise again. Yahweh will be its light in the darkness of exile.

<span id="page-497-9"></span><span id="page-497-5"></span>7:9 The nation accepts the just judgment of Yahweh and acknowledges its sin. But it is confident that Yahweh will not give up on it. This confidence has been rooted in Yahweh's promise to restore the remnant (2:12–13; 4:6–7), which itself is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (7:20).

<span id="page-497-15"></span><span id="page-497-10"></span><span id="page-497-2"></span>7:10 The enemy's taunt ("Where is the Lord your God?") is virtually a refrain throughout the Scriptures, hurled at the people of God as an epithet of scorn (Pss. 42:3, 10; 79:10; 115:2; Joel 2:17). But the enemy who seems victorious will soon be trampled in the streets. This is a sign of victory for the people of God, an echo of the pulverizing of the enemy with bronze hooves in Micah 4:13, the trampling of Jezebel by Jehu (2 Kings 9:33), and the crushing of the serpent by the seed of the woman (cf. Gen. 3:15; Isa. 65:25).

<span id="page-497-11"></span><span id="page-497-8"></span><span id="page-497-1"></span><span id="page-497-0"></span>7:11 After describing the judgment of God and the demise of the enemy, this verse announces the building of Jerusalem. The walls are built, and the "boundary [*khoq*] shall be far extended." This line in the ESV forms a nice parallel with the previous one, which emphasizes the building of walls. However, the word translated "boundary" often signifies "laws" and "decrees," in which case the sense would be that Jerusalem's rule is extended far and wide. The idea would then be that the word of the Lord will go forth from Jerusalem so that even "far away" nations will come and meet the new King (cf. 4:2–3).

<span id="page-497-12"></span><span id="page-497-7"></span>7:12 As a consequence, the nations migrate to Jerusalem so that it becomes the "metropolis of the [new] world."49 The geographical references—north and south (from Assyria to Egypt, and Egypt to the River, i.e., the Euphrates) and east and west (from sea to sea)—suggest the entirety of the Near East is involved in this pilgrimage. It is possible that this text may be referring to the gathering of the exiles, but it seems to be more in harmony with 4:1–4 and the ingathering of the nations. The salvation of Assyria and Egypt are included in Isaiah's prophecy (Isa. 19:25), and also in Psalm 87. When they come to Jerusalem, they are born again!

<span id="page-497-13"></span><span id="page-497-6"></span><span id="page-497-4"></span><span id="page-497-3"></span>7:13 One of the reasons the nations migrate to Jerusalem is the destitution of their lands, which have been made desolate because of their sins. This may refer to the fruits of war and violence. A similar thought was expressed in 2:10, which describes how Judah had become corrupt because of the sins of covetous land barons.

<span id="page-497-14"></span>7:14–15 A command is given to God to shepherd his people, who dwell alone in the "forest." This may be an echo of the abandoned site of the temple, which had

<sup>49</sup> John Calvin, *Commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets*, 387.

<span id="page-498-4"></span><span id="page-498-2"></span>become a hill in the forest (cf. 3:12). God will lead the flock instead to Bashan and Gilead, an area renowned for its fertility and consequently its prize cattle (cf. Amos 4:1). The scattered flock will become healthy and flourishing. But beyond this physical provision, God will accomplish a salvation whose magnitude can only be compared to the exodus from Egypt, in which God displayed his wonders. Given the reference to the messianic King who would shepherd his people in the second major section of Micah (5:4), this text may refer to the King from Bethlehem, and it therefore may be a direct address to him; he may thus be the one speaking in 7:15.

<span id="page-498-8"></span><span id="page-498-7"></span><span id="page-498-6"></span>7:16 When the nations see Jerusalem and her new King, they will become ashamed of their power. It is related that Napoleon, during his later years, once remarked to his minister of education, "Do you know, Fontanes, what astonishes me most in this world? The inability of force to create anything. In the long run the sword is always beaten by the spirit."50 In the last days, the nations will see this impotence of power and will become dumb and deaf. There is nothing more to say, nothing more to hear. They have based their lives on the wrong premise.

<span id="page-498-9"></span><span id="page-498-1"></span>7:17 The nations will assume a posture of abasement and humiliation, which may well be a sign of repentance, given the context. They will "turn in dread" to Yahweh, which also has connotations of awe, as the same expression is used in relation to Israel's salvation by Yahweh in the last days (Hos. 3:5). The object of fear in "they shall be in fear of you" is ambiguous; it could be a reference to God or to Israel. The parallelism with the previous line ("they shall turn in dread to the Lord our God") suggests that God is probably the referent. Thus this text fills in more details of the nations' salvation already announced in Micah 4:1–4.

<span id="page-498-10"></span><span id="page-498-5"></span><span id="page-498-3"></span><span id="page-498-0"></span>7:18–19 This text intentionally plays on the meaning of Micah's name ("Who is like Yahweh?"), found at the beginning of the book (1:1). Thus it leaves the audience with a final answer to the rhetorical question embedded in his name. What follows are seven characteristics of Yahweh, intentionally echoing the revelation of the divine name to Moses on Mount Sinai (Ex. 34:6–7). The central attribute of the seven is "steadfast love" (*hesed* ), which provides a motive not only for the third attribute but for all of them: Yahweh delights in steadfast love. There is a general chiastic pattern used to display these qualities. Micah says that God

- A. pardons iniquity;
	- B. passes over transgression;
		- C. does not retain anger;
			- D. delights in steadfast love;
		- C'. shows compassion;
	- B'. treads down iniquities; and
- A'. casts away sins.

<sup>50</sup> Quoted in J. Christopher Herold, *The Age of Napoleon* (New York: Mariner Books, 2002), 76; cited in Abraham Heschel, *The Prophets* (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2007), 204.

The first two and last two traits deal with sin, while the third and fifth stress cessation of anger and renewal of compassion, and the fourth focuses on motivation. These are all an exposition of the rhetorical question that begins the sequence: "Who is a God like you?"

<span id="page-499-5"></span><span id="page-499-4"></span>In Micah 7:18a, the divine pardoning of iniquity suggests the lifting up of sin from someone, and thus the bearing of it by another party. In Isaiah the suffering servant bears the sin of many (Isa. 53:4, 11); the word "pardoning" thus indicates suffering love. The "passing over" of transgression means the overlooking of sin (cf. Prov. 19:11), while "remnant of his inheritance" refers to those who have survived the judgment.

<span id="page-499-6"></span><span id="page-499-3"></span>In Micah 7:18b–19a we see that anger does not finally mark God; his anger is a response to sin, and he has shown his fury with the sin of his people throughout Micah, but his chief attribute is steadfast love (*hesed* ). It is not just that he practices it; he *delights* in it. It is what gets him excited! Calvin aptly remarks, "The only prop or support that can raise us up to God, when we desire to be reconciled to him, is this—that he loves mercy."51 God's renewal of compassion based on his steadfast love is one of the principal attributes found in the great explanation of God's name in Exodus 34:5–7.

<span id="page-499-7"></span><span id="page-499-2"></span><span id="page-499-0"></span>In the rest of Micah 7:19 we see that in order to deal with sins finally and conclusively, God treads them underfoot and casts them into the depths of the sea. This treading down of sin suggests triumphal victory and may be an intentional echo of the dominion that Adam and Eve were to have at the beginning of creation (Gen. 1:28). But it has now been accomplished by the Lord! Moreover, not only will sin be overcome; it will be forever removed from sight, thrown into the depths of the ocean. Just as Yahweh cast all of Pharaoh's army into the depths of the sea, drowning them forever (Ex. 15:2, 19), so will he do the same to Israel's sins.

<span id="page-499-8"></span><span id="page-499-1"></span>7:20 It is fitting that the final verse of Micah returns to the covenantal roots of Israel and emphasizes God's steadfast love (*hesed* ). The promise to the patriarchs— God's pledge to them in the distant past—still stands. The prophecy of Micah is living proof of that. Everything in the prophecy is a testimony to God's faithfulness to the patriarchal promises and his steadfast love. The word pair "faithfulness" and "steadfast love" almost always occurs as "steadfast love and faithfulness." But here they are reversed to end on a final note of steadfast love. Everything is based on this. God delights in steadfast love. This is why he made a promise to Abraham, so that steadfast love would overflow and be a blessing to the entire world.

### *Response*

The final prayer and praise of Micah is an appropriate prayer for God's people everywhere, especially on this side of the cross of Jesus Christ. It provides a blueprint for God's plan of salvation for the world, beginning with the confession of God's people and their willingness to submit to God's discipline; continuing to

<sup>51</sup> Calvin, *Commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets*, 403.

the challenge to the enemy, the building of the city of God into a metropolis of the world, and the call to the divine shepherd to lead his people into victory; and concluding with the salvation of the nations. The Christian church has seen the salvation to which Micah pointed. They have seen Jesus build his new city on a hill to share the good news with the nations; they have seen many peoples from many nations humble themselves and turn to God in repentance and worship. They have borne witness to the cross of Christ, which has produced forgiveness and pardon and the vanquishing of sin and death.

And yet, Micah's prophecy has been only partially fulfilled. There is still the ongoing power of death and evil, which are very much alive in the world. It seems that Micah (and many of the prophets) only prophesied one coming of the Messiah. But the NT makes clear this one coming has two phases. First he comes as the suffering servant to suffer and die and rise again. This represents the power of the new world in the old, the announcement to the nations that there is a new world order. For the nations to be saved, that new world order is proclaimed, and the nations are called to go up to "Jerusalem" to hear the word of the Lord. But in the meantime, the powers of death and sin continue to wreak havoc. The church needs to continue to confess its sin, shine its light, and pray to its Shepherd to lead and guide it into all truth. To those peoples who would taunt the church with the question, "Where is your God?" the church must respond, "The tomb is empty, Jesus Christ has been exalted to the highest place, and eventually every knee will bow before him and confess that he is Lord" (cf. Phil. 2:5–11). Repent and believe the good news; bring your spears and swords and transform them into tools that bring life! (cf. Mic. 4:3).

## INTRODUCTION TO NAHUM

## *Overview*

<span id="page-505-4"></span><span id="page-505-3"></span><span id="page-505-2"></span><span id="page-505-0"></span>The book of Nahum announces God's response to human wrongs, whether against God or against other human beings. It begins with a hymn (1:2–8) that presents the final, perfect realization of God's response to human sin. The hymn connects finding refuge in the Lord to survival of a final divine judgment (v. 7), and also connects ultimate destruction with continued rebellion against him (v. 8). As this hymn presents punishment and deliverance as consequences of either opposing or trusting God, it makes clear that God is not simply on the side of all Judeans, nor is he the enemy only of Assyria; all people will have to give an account of whether they have trusted him or have instead rebelled against him.

Against this ultimate horizon, the rest of the book of Nahum predicts and reflects upon the fall of the Assyrian Empire as punishment for its violence, idolatry, and prideful autonomy. Although Nahum focuses on the Assyrian Empire in the context of its abusive and oppressive relationship to Judah, it recognizes that God's deliverance of Judah will also bring deliverance to other nations mistreated by Assyria. The fall of Assyria will be good news to those who suffered at its hands, and in Judah's case it is part of God's far-reaching plan to restore his covenant relationship with her.

## *Title*

<span id="page-505-1"></span>The book is named after the prophet whose oracles it records, Nahum of Elkosh (1:1). Nahum's name means "compassion" or "comfort," focusing the reader's attention on the effect that God's judgment of Assyria—and ultimately of sin in all its forms—will have on those who trust in him.

## *Author*

There is no detailed information available concerning the life of Nahum of Elkosh, and even the location of his hometown is uncertain. The literary quality of his oracles and his obvious familiarity with Neo-Assyrian propaganda suggest he was closely associated with the Judean royal court, a primary recipient of Assyrian propaganda.

## *Date and Occasion*

Nahum's ministry and message are situated between the destruction of the Egyptian city of Thebes (No-Amon) in 663 BC, a past event on which the prophet <span id="page-506-4"></span><span id="page-506-1"></span>reflects in 3:8–10, and the prophesied fall of Nineveh, which occurred in 612 BC. Because the book implies that Assyria was at full strength at the time of writing (1:12), Nahum's oracles most likely date to 650 or earlier, as internal revolts began to weaken Assyria around that time.

The book of Nahum focuses on the Lord's sovereignty over, and punishment of, Assyria for its self-glorifying mistreatment of Judah and other nations. Assyria oppressed, exploited, and used human beings as it saw fit, attributing its success to its king and the gods who supposedly supported and empowered him, especially the national god Assur. From the late tenth century BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire developed quickly, and apart from a period of stagnation from c. 815–750, its expansion was uninterrupted. In the second half of the eighth century BC, Assyria expanded to its southwest and so brought Judah and Israel under its direct control; the northern kingdom of Israel fell to Assyria in 722. Judah was weakened by Sennacherib's attack in 701 but survived it and actually outlasted the Assyrian Empire. During much of the seventh century BC, however, Judah served as Assyria's vassal and so was obliged to send it regular payments, accept its exploitation of Judah's natural and agricultural resources, and contribute soldiers to its military campaigns.

Judah had little hope of escaping the Assyrian Empire's grasp. Judah was vastly inferior as a military power, and Assyria did much to discourage its vassal states from rebelling by punishing in extreme ways those who did not remain submissive to the empire. Public beheading, flaying, and impalement were possible fates of those who rebelled. In order to transmit this stark reality to the representatives of foreign states who came to pay taxes and homage to the Assyrian king, artwork (bas reliefs) in Assyrian palaces depicted in great detail the violent punishment of rebel states. Assyrian kings also authored numerous inscriptions recounting their violence against such rebels. Assurnasirpal II (c. 883–859) offered a typical description of what followed an Assyrian victory: "I captured soldiers alive by hand. I impaled [them] on stakes in front of their cities."1

<span id="page-506-3"></span>Nahum announces and describes the imminent divine judgment that will put an end to this violent status quo by destroying Assyria. Although written before the event, Nahum anticipates Assyria's fall in great detail, often representing it as if it had already occurred (e.g., ch. 2). The comfort the book announces is thus closely tied to the message of Assyria's fall (1:15; 3:19) and more generally to God's commitment to accomplish his perfect justice in due time.

#### <span id="page-506-2"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

Like most other prophetic books, Nahum includes a variety of literary forms. These include the opening hymn describing the Lord's arrival to judge and deliver (1:2–8), short speeches of judgment and deliverance (1:9–15), longer prophecies of

<span id="page-507-8"></span><span id="page-507-4"></span>Nahum is full of lively images, colors, sounds, and voices. Many of its images seem to ironically reuse Neo-Assyrian propaganda or ideology that presented the Assyrian king in particular as invincible. This literary resistance is especially clear in Nahum's use of lion imagery (2:11–13) and the prediction that the Lord will eliminate the king's name (glory and posterity), gods, and existence (1:14). The description of Nineveh's fall in chapter 2 is full of colors and sounds emphasizing the power of the army that will conquer the city, and Nahum even hears (by anticipation) the defenders calling out "Halt! Halt!" to fleeing soldiers (2:8), as well as the attackers' parallel call to "Plunder the silver, plunder the gold!" (2:9).

<span id="page-507-10"></span><span id="page-507-9"></span><span id="page-507-7"></span><span id="page-507-6"></span>As these examples show, direct speech (i.e., quotation) is used to great effect in Nahum. In another notable case, the Lord's announcements in first-person speech, "Behold, I am against you" (2:13; 3:5), present him as the enemy of the Assyrian Empire in the most direct way possible. Similarly, the sarcastic taunts of chapter 3, although spoken and written to a Judean audience, are addressed to an Assyrian audience.

## *Theology of Nahum; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

#### GOD AS VICTORIOUS WARRIOR AND JUDGE OF SIN

<span id="page-507-1"></span>The predominant image of God in Nahum is that of the Divine Warrior who triumphs over his enemy. As is the case throughout the OT, this conflict has a strong moral overtone. God's combat is a response to his enemy's aggression against him, as the Lord punishes human pride in its boldest and most blasphemous colors. This is emphasized by repeated references to "avenging . . . avenging . . . vengeance" in 1:2. As our brief glances at the empire's ideology showed, Assyria was a concrete example of an empire that considered itself independent of God and able to combat him directly (1:9, 11; cf. 2 Kings 18–19). Similarly, the Lord's enemies in Nahum 1:2–8 are not the type who surrender; instead, they persist in their rebellion against him until he destroys them (1:8).

<span id="page-507-16"></span><span id="page-507-15"></span><span id="page-507-14"></span><span id="page-507-13"></span><span id="page-507-12"></span><span id="page-507-3"></span><span id="page-507-2"></span><span id="page-507-0"></span>This theme is fulfilled in the NT in surprising ways. While God threatens the unrepentant with judgment (Heb. 9:27), Christ's first coming does not immediately bring about their ultimate judgment. Instead, the fullest revelation of God's wrath against sin outside the context of final judgment is seen in the cross of Jesus Christ. God's punishment of the sins of others in Jesus Christ was such that his one and only Son was forsaken, deprived of the intimate fellowship and favorable presence of his Father (Matt. 27:46), and was "made . . . to be sin" (2 Cor. 5:21). In the cross, God is victorious over sin, destroying its power (Col. 2:13–15), defeating the Devil (1 Corinthians 15), and condemning all who reject Christ to eternal destruction in a final demonstration of his perfect justice (Rev. 20:9–10).

#### GOD AS THE ONLY REFUGE AND DELIVERER

<span id="page-508-3"></span><span id="page-508-0"></span>Although most of Nahum focuses on the combat through which the Lord will destroy his enemies, its message (which is addressed to Judeans) is ultimately one of hope and comfort, for God is rich in mercy and grace to those who trust in him. This is hinted at first by the echo in 1:3 of Exodus 34:6, describing the Lord as "slow to anger." Despite his inexpressible wrath against sin, the Lord is able and willing to pardon those who have sinned against him yet nevertheless take refuge in him (Nah. 1:7). In other words, even God's enemies can experience his grace when they abandon their opposition to him and seek reconciliation. Indeed, the OT affirms that even Nineveh—a major (and sometimes capital) city of Assyria—was offered such an opportunity through Jonah's very unusual and direct call to abandon its enmity against Yahweh. It was only because their initial repentance did not endure that Nahum's declaration of judgment came, a century later.

<span id="page-508-9"></span><span id="page-508-4"></span><span id="page-508-1"></span>In the OT, the sacrificial system in particular bears witness to the mercy of God toward those who have offended him, for he instituted such a system in order to reconcile penitent Israelites to himself (Lev. 17:11). The future reality to which that system bore witness, the sacrifice of God's Son in the place of sinners, put an end to the system that prefigured it (Hebrews 8). As a result of Christ's finished work, believers are forgiven all their sins (Rom. 3:21–26), are sheltered from God's wrath against sin (Heb. 2:14–15), have access to the holy of holies—where their high priest is seated and is always ready to help (Heb. 4:14–16)—and pursue service of God (Heb. 9:14) as they await their final salvation (Heb. 10:19–25; 12:1–24).

#### <span id="page-508-10"></span><span id="page-508-8"></span><span id="page-508-7"></span>THE DAY OF THE LORD

<span id="page-508-2"></span>The "day of the Lord" is a theme that runs across the canon of Scripture. While in the OT the phrase often refers to concrete historical events (e.g., the fall of Jerusalem; Lam. 2:21), even those cases overlap in significance with the fullest sense of the phrase, which refers to God's decisive and final intervention in world affairs. The book of Nahum contains both of these senses of "the day": the fall of Assyria is a limited, concrete manifestation of God's wrath in judgment and mercy in deliverance, while the book's opening hymn broadens its perspective to include the final fulfillment of the day of the Lord, in which he will punish the unrepentant and deliver those who trust in him.

<span id="page-508-6"></span><span id="page-508-5"></span>The day of the Lord relates to the work of Christ in two ways. First, God's wrath against sin was assuaged on the cross and thus no longer threatens those who trust in Christ (1 Thess. 1:10). Believers therefore may begin to enjoy here and now the full deliverance awaiting them at the end of the age, when they will enter the new heaven and new earth with a resurrected body and a soul perfectly cleansed from sin and fully committed to loving, worshiping, and serving God. The other side of the day of the Lord is much more somber, involving Christ as the judge of "those who do not know God and . . . those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus" (2 Thess. 1:8). This two-sided reality, the glory of God in judging and in saving, is

at the heart of the gospel the church proclaims, promising in Christ's name full pardon and eternal life to a world that is under the threat of his just wrath.

### HOPE AND JOY

<span id="page-509-3"></span>Hope and joy are interrelated themes in Nahum, as well as elsewhere in Scripture. Joy takes account of future as well as present good, while hope looks forward to what will one day become reality. Nahum encourages both. First, in the more limited context of Assyria's fall, Nahum encourages Judeans to rejoice in God's promise to destroy Assyria (Nah. 1:15). The book foresees that not only Judah but also all nations mistreated by Assyria will clap their hands for joy when Assyria finally falls (3:19). Second, the hymn in 1:2–8 is structured so as to produce in the reader a crushing fear of the Lord's imminent judgment (1:6), only to reveal at the last minute that escape is possible (1:7) but cannot be presumed upon (1:8). If the fall of Assyria is grounds for joy, how much more is deliverance from God's ultimate judgment through the shelter that is God himself?

<span id="page-509-5"></span><span id="page-509-2"></span><span id="page-509-1"></span><span id="page-509-0"></span>The twin themes of sober joy over God's just punishment of the wicked and exuberant celebration of his abundant grace in saving some through the sacrifice of his own Son appear regularly in Revelation, a book that has much in common with Nahum. After an opening vision into heaven that overwhelms the reader with the outpouring of praise to the triune God for his salvation (Revelation 4–5), the book reflects repeatedly on the deliverance of those saved from or through persecution (Rev. 7:15–17) and on the just punishment of God's enemies (Rev. 16:5–19:3; cf. both themes together in 11:17–18).

<span id="page-509-8"></span><span id="page-509-7"></span><span id="page-509-6"></span>The message of Revelation is essentially the message of Nahum restated in light of God's redemptive actions fully revealed in Christ. Believers who are presently oppressed and persecuted can trust God to deliver them in due time and are called to hold fast to him in faith and obedience to the gospel in the meantime (Rev. 22:10–15). Both Testaments encourage persecuted believers by reminding them that the most extreme manifestations of evil in the world today, even those surpassing in scope the violence and evil of the Assyrian and Roman Empires, will nonetheless be brought to an end. A hope anchored in the Word of God and its promises is fortified by the fulfillment of God's past judgments against evil, waiting expectantly for the final fulfillment of his plan of redemption at Christ's return (Heb. 6:11–20).2

#### <span id="page-509-4"></span>*Preaching from Nahum*

Preaching from Nahum depends, first of all, on understanding the differences between the eschatological context of 1:2–8 and the historically specific nature of the fall of Assyria predicted in the rest of the book. The two parts of the book are clearly linked, but the opening hymn presents an ultimate judgment that includes all of humanity and that is rendered exclusively in accordance with the individual's relationship to God. Each person is either God's enemy or one who

<sup>2</sup> See the articles on various aspects of persecution and faithful Christian witness in *Unio Cum Christo* 1 (2015).

trusts in him for deliverance from his wrath against sin, and one's nationality plays no role whatsoever in this final judgment.

<span id="page-510-0"></span>The rest of the book, by contrast, deals with Assyria as an empire that exalts itself above God—and above Judah as the punished but repentant people of God. The political nature of the deliverance and punishment in this section is clearly focused on Judah and Assyria as nations. This kind of punishment and deliverance is only a faint shadow of the eschatological deliverance announced in 1:2–8. Understanding the similarities and differences between these two perspectives helps prevent misunderstanding the book as an expression of nationalism or xenophobia (since it is not simply Assyria that is subject to punishment) and forces the reader to understand historical judgments like the fall of Assyria as a foretaste of God's unchanging commitment to do away with evil once and for all at the end of the age.

Responsible use of Nahum in preaching also requires the preacher to appreciate the idolatrous nature of human claims to autonomy and to resist the temptation to limit the sins of idolatry, autonomy, and rebellion against God to nation-states or other groups. Although the Assyrian Empire offers plenty of evidence for such attitudes on the part of the king, neither then nor now are such attitudes restricted to political leaders or to those without some religious affiliation. On the contrary, individuals in all societies tolerate, promote, or practice autonomy from the Lord and the other sins for which he condemns Assyria (3:1–5, etc.).

<span id="page-510-5"></span><span id="page-510-3"></span>Since these attitudes and priorities are inevitably present in the cultures in which Christians find themselves, careful analysis of one's culture and of one's own heart is thus essential to identifying accurately the ways in which evil seeks to capture believers and unbelievers alike. Such analysis is also essential to Christian ethics and growth as described in the NT, which focuses on the believer's renewal from the inside out. United with the resurrected Christ and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, believers are called to renew their minds (Rom. 12:1–2), putting off the old man and putting on the new (Col. 3:1–17) in constant pursuit of conformity to the image of the Son of God (Rom. 8:29). This inevitably involves being "in" but not "of" the larger culture in which we live and thus requires knowledge of our culture, the ways in which it opposes the gospel, and how the gospel challenges its claims.3

#### <span id="page-510-6"></span><span id="page-510-4"></span>*Interpretive Challenges*

<span id="page-510-1"></span>Apart from some difficult and obscure expressions here and there (e.g., Nah. 1:10), the main interpretive difficulty of Nahum is what some would call its heartless joy at the fall of Assyria: was not the empire mainly populated by those who had little or nothing to do with the evils for which the whole empire was to be punished? And did not the fall of Assyria deliver from divine discipline some Judeans who deserved it (1:12)?

<span id="page-510-2"></span><sup>3</sup> See Leonardo De Chirico, "Post-Christian Confession in Secular Context," *Unio Cum Christo* 1 (2015): 175–186; and the summary of Charles Taylor's thought in James K. A. Smith, *How (Not) To Be Secular: Reading Charles Taylor* (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2014).

<span id="page-511-3"></span>In approaching these questions, it is particularly important to notice how Nahum defines the various groups it presents. Given Nahum's focus on Assyria's violence toward other nations, a focus on Judah and Assyria as distinct states is inevitable. But this is not the only way they are identified. Judah is also God's chosen people who receives his gracious protection, yet at the same time it is a nation that until very recently was under covenant punishment (1:12) for its sinful leaders and citizens (notably Manasseh and Amon). The fact that every Judean will benefit from the fall of Assyria regardless of his or her spiritual condition is not proof that God has overlooked their sin. Rather, he has remained faithful to his promises by preserving a remnant, but also sparing along with them others who do not share their faithfulness. Importantly, this restoration is restricted to the temporal sphere; Judah's newfound peace and liberty hardly imply that each and every Judean would escape God's final judgment against sin (cf. 1:2–6, 8). That occurs only for those with a definitive relationship of faith and trust in Yahweh (1:7).

<span id="page-511-2"></span>Similarly, Assyria is not merely represented by an army and an elite; it also includes a general population distinct from the elite in various ways (cf. the elite in 1:11, 14; 2:12–14; and the populace in 2:10; 3:18). Although Nahum announces the fall of the *empire*, he is announcing not the death of every Assyrian but rather the undoing of the empire through the destruction of its army, leaders, and political structures. This explains why Nahum foresees that some Assyrians would survive the fall of Nineveh and its king (2:10; 3:18).

<span id="page-511-4"></span>God was surely just to do away with the Assyrian Empire. Indeed, he could have destroyed each and every Assyrian for his or her sins while remaining perfectly just. Yet the book's focus on the empire means that the primary target of God's punishment is those who embodied the empire. While Assyria's fall inevitably involved hardship and perhaps even death for some of the general population, Nahum pays no attention to that reality, at least partially because he foresees different degrees of punishment. While the empire falls and never rises again, the majority of its population would simply have become Babylonian and continued their lives as citizens of that empire.4 Still, as was the case with Judah, God's mercy as shown in some Assyrians' survival of Assyria's fall does not mean they were without sin or would survive God's final and ultimate judgment (1:2–6, 8). For that to take place, they would have to turn to him in faith (1:7).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-513-1"></span>After introducing the author and the overall theme of the book, this section presents a vision of God as coming to judge the world once and for all, with a focus on his vengeance against his enemies. Unlike the rest of the book, 1:2–8 offers a global perspective that does not limit itself to the relationship between Assyria and Judah in the seventh century BC. On the contrary, every inhabitant of the world (v. 5) will be affected by this judgment, which devastates and undoes the created order (vv. 4–5).

<span id="page-513-4"></span><span id="page-513-3"></span><span id="page-513-2"></span>Despite the worldwide extent of this judgment, escape is possible, but only because the God who comes to judge his enemies is also good, offering shelter to those who abandon all other means of escape and trust only in him (v. 7). The only other possible outcome is complete destruction, which threatens all the guilty who refuse to take refuge in the Lord and instead persist in their opposition to him (v. 8).

## *Comment*

1:1 The book's opening verse characterizes the book as an "oracle." This literary genre typically includes divine speeches and explanations of them. It also presents God's actions (past, present, or future) in relation to human behavior (especially sin) and indicates how the reader should respond to its message.5

Nahum's oracle is focused on Nineveh, which became Assyria's capital city in 704 BC and thus in this book represents the empire as a whole. In the ancient world, Nineveh was a large city, boasting multiple temples, irrigated royal gardens, and an immense defensive wall 9 miles (14.5 km) long, encircling the city.

<sup>5</sup> Michael H. Floyd, *Minor Prophets: Part 2*, FOTL 22 (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000), 631.

The opening verse adds that the book had its origins in a "vision" that came to Nahum. The location of his hometown, "Elkosh," is uncertain, and since the prophet is mentioned nowhere else in Scripture, nothing else is known of his life or ministry.

<span id="page-514-5"></span><span id="page-514-4"></span>1:2–3b Following the introduction is an opening hymn (vv. 2–8). Its first section (vv. 2–3b) presents God almost entirely in terms of his "vengeance" and "wrath" against his enemies, who are identified as "guilty" (1:3b). In this context, the adjective "jealous" describes God's relentless commitment to his glory, honor, and holiness in the face of sinful opposition to him and his will.

<span id="page-514-6"></span><span id="page-514-2"></span><span id="page-514-1"></span>The only elements unconnected to God's punitive response to sin appear in 1:3a ("slow to anger and of great power"). The first element ("slow to anger") echoes part of God's self-description in Exodus 34:6–7, while the second ("of great power") focuses on his deliverance of his people (cf. Ex. 32:11). Since these allusions to God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt and his mercy toward them after their idolatrous worship of the golden calf are so brief, they only minimally nuance the emphasis on God's wrath against his guilty enemies. He remains slow to anger and ready to deliver, as Nahum 1:7 shows, but the dominant note here is his imminent punishment of sin.

<span id="page-514-12"></span><span id="page-514-7"></span><span id="page-514-0"></span>1:3c–5 The perspective in these verses shifts to the Lord's arrival as Warrior and Judge, moving downward from storm clouds to the earth's mountains and rivers. The image of drying up rivers and seas appears frequently in descriptions of judgment and deliverance, both those in the past (e.g., at the Red Sea; Exodus 14) and those yet to occur (Isa. 19:5–6; Jer. 51:36; Zech. 10:11). Bashan and Carmel were both well-watered and productive agricultural regions, and the fact that they "wither" reinforces the negative, destructive focus of the passage.

<span id="page-514-11"></span><span id="page-514-10"></span><span id="page-514-9"></span><span id="page-514-8"></span><span id="page-514-3"></span>1:6–8 The mention of "all who dwell" on earth at the end of verse 5 leads smoothly into the last section of this unit (vv. 6–8), focusing on the significance for mankind of this judgment. Two rhetorical questions (v. 6a) and two descriptions of God's wrath (v. 6b) make it impossible to presume that one can easily escape the coming judgment, and verse 7 affirms that only one path of escape exists. Deliverance is found in God himself, who is "good" and knows (has a personal relationship with) those who trust him for safety from his wrath against sin. All of mankind is thus divided into two groups in the context of this global judgment: those who seek refuge in God (v. 7) and those who continue as his enemies despite the warning Nahum offers of coming judgment (v. 8).

While the rest of the book of Nahum refers to an event that is now far in the past, the global judgment foreseen here has not yet taken place — with (as we shall see) one important exception. The detailed and powerful description of the destructive effects of God's wrath on his creation, and especially on those human beings who refuse to submit to and trust in him, thus hits the reader with its full force. Who among us has not ignored or even denied God's glory and infinite worth by pursuing our own will rather than his? We thus all stand exposed to his wrath.

<span id="page-515-0"></span>The only legitimate response envisioned by this passage is an immediate and absolute submission to the very God whom our sins have angered. Here the crucial exception to this passage's future aspect appears: God *has* punished the sins of all those who trust in him; amazingly, he has done so in the suffering and death of his incarnate Son. Although perfectly holy and just in punishing sin, God can graciously offer deliverance to those who cannot escape his justice on their own but instead look to him for refuge (Rom. 3:21–26). As Nahum 1:8 reminds us, any other course of action is sure to fail, inevitably exposing the unprotected sinner to God's wrath.

## *Section Overview*

This section narrows the book's focus to Assyria and its relation to Judah. God speaks twice each to Assyria and Judah, alternating between one and the other and promising destruction to Assyria and deliverance to Judah. The second address to Judah (v. 15) is one of the few occasions in which the book encourages a specific response by Judah to Assyria's destruction.

## <span id="page-516-8"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-516-6"></span><span id="page-516-1"></span>1:9–11 The entire section of 1:9–3:19 addresses or refers to the Assyrian king, capital, and empire. That God declares the empire guilty of opposing him (1:9) makes clear that the Assyrian Empire shares this essential trait (rebellion) with all of God's enemies, whose sins evoke his jealous anger (v. 3). The Assyrian Empire is thus one of the adversaries against whom God's wrath will be poured out (v. 8), even as it plots against him (v. 9).

<span id="page-516-4"></span><span id="page-516-2"></span><span id="page-516-0"></span>The plot mentioned in verse 9a probably refers to or at least includes Assyrian military action against Judah in 701 BC, when the Assyrian king Sennacherib conquered forty-six fortified towns in Judah and claimed that the Lord would not be able to deliver even Jerusalem from his siege (Isa. 36:18–20; 37:11–13). This claim is central to God's condemnation of Assyria (their ethnicity is not the issue). Assyria's ongoing opposition to Judah, and its constant affirmations that its king and his gods were supreme and superior to all others meets with God's curt affirmation that he will put an end to it.

<span id="page-516-7"></span><span id="page-516-3"></span>The phrase "make a complete end" (Nah. 1:9) echoes the description of God's destruction of his adversaries in verse 8 and indicates that Assyria would never again ("not . . . a second time"; v. 9) oppose the Lord. The word translated "trouble" can also mean "adversary"; in the context, Assyria is the most likely referent regardless of how the term is translated. The certainty of Assyria's fall is reinforced by two comparisons in verse 10. Just as thorns inevitably grow together and become <span id="page-517-3"></span>entangled, and as surely as drunkards turn to drink, so is the destruction of those who "[plot] evil against the Lord" (v. 11) inevitable, beginning with Assyria.

The Lord repeats in verse 11 his condemnation of Assyria's plot against him during its invasion of Judah, and while the "counselor" could come from either Assyria (as he sets out to attack Judah) or Jerusalem (as he leaves Judah), the counselor himself is surely the Assyrian king. But his plan will come to nothing, for his counsel is "worthless."

<span id="page-517-4"></span>1:12–13 God now turns to speak to Judah, and the theme changes from judgment to deliverance. God comforts his people by assuring them that, even though the Assyrian king has plotted against them with his large and powerful army, Assyria will not survive God's judgment. Furthermore, its destruction will spell the end of this stage of God's covenantal discipline of his people, and when he liberates Judah she will no longer have to offer her wealth and human resources to Assyria as its vassal (v. 13).

<span id="page-517-6"></span><span id="page-517-5"></span>1:14 The second speech to Assyria (v. 14) focuses on a male individual, almost certainly the king. God's edict concerning him has three elements: his name will come to an end (meaning both his reputation as a glorious warrior and his legacy), his gods will be destroyed, and he himself will die. The Lord imposes this punishment because the Assyrian king is "vile," meaning that despite his claims to be without rival and able to overcome all enemies with the support of his Assyrian gods, he is radically insignificant. His God-dishonoring arrogance will be punished by death.

<span id="page-517-8"></span><span id="page-517-7"></span><span id="page-517-2"></span>1:15 In light of the coming fall of the Assyrian Empire (vv. 9–10) and its king (vv. 14, 15b), Nahum speaks once again to Judah, encouraging her to rejoice because of the "good news" that Judah will once again know "peace." "Feasts" refers to Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths, all celebrations of God's deliverance of his people in the past and his provision for them in the present. The liberation of Judah from Assyria's power is a new act of deliverance, comparable to the exodus from Egypt, and calls for similar celebration.

## *Response*

<span id="page-517-0"></span>This passage calls Judah to celebrate God as the one who brings peace through destruction of her worst enemy, who is also an enemy of the Lord. It is a partial but concrete fulfillment of God's promise in 1:2–8 to deliver fully those who trust in him while completely destroying evil (cf. 1:8) and thus is a faint shadow of the gospel as "good news."

<span id="page-517-13"></span><span id="page-517-12"></span><span id="page-517-11"></span><span id="page-517-10"></span><span id="page-517-9"></span><span id="page-517-1"></span>This promise is progressively fulfilled in Jesus' earthly ministry when he exercises dominion over demonic forces (e.g., Mark 1:21–28) and renders the Devil powerless through his atoning death (Heb. 2:14). Its final completion awaits Christ's final victory over all his enemies (Rev. 19:11–21) and the consignment of the Devil and his fellow rebels against God to the "lake of fire and sulfur" forever (Rev. 20:10). This righteous judgment elicits the praise of the saints (Rev. 19:1–3), and its logical <span id="page-518-2"></span><span id="page-518-1"></span><span id="page-518-0"></span>counterpart is their full deliverance and eternal fellowship with the triune God in the new Jerusalem, where they will celebrate him as their Deliverer (Rev. 21:26). Until then, the church's response to this hope is to live in obedient faith as it prays the prayer that closes the canon of Scripture: "Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-519-3"></span>This chapter contemplates the future fall of Assyria as if it were happening right before the author's eyes. The focus narrows to Nineveh in 2:3–10, where Nahum presents the fall of the empire's capital city in a series of detailed images that move forward in time and space from the beginning of the attack outside the city to its defeat and the looting of its treasuries. In verses 11–13 the focus broadens again to include the whole empire, which is compared to a pride of lions which has decimated its prey but will soon be destroyed.

## *Section Outline*

	- A. Call for Assyria to Prepare Its Defenses (2:1)

	- C. Anticipation of Nineveh's Fall (2:3–10)
	- D. Anticipation of Assyria's Fall (2:11–13)

## <span id="page-519-4"></span>*Comment*

2:1 Nahum's depiction of Assyria's fall as having already occurred begins with a call for the empire as a whole to prepare for an attack. This command is sarcastic, since the rest of the chapter affirms that the attack will succeed despite Assyria's military power. That same confidence accounts for the brief reflection on how Assyria's defeat will benefit Judah (v. 2).

<span id="page-519-0"></span>2:2 This verse develops a fuller picture of how God's intervention will benefit Judah, building on 1:11–13, 15, which mentioned Judah's liberation from God's <span id="page-520-3"></span><span id="page-520-1"></span><span id="page-520-0"></span>covenant discipline (1:12) and Assyrian oppression (vv. 13, 15). Here "restoring" Jacob's majesty could signify restoration of Judah's sovereignty over her territory, as suggested by Psalm 47:4, or it could signify a change in Judah and her fortunes similar to the change in Jacob's life when he wrestled with God and sought divine blessing with all his might (Gen. 32:22–32). Both meanings may be in view here: the elimination of Assyria would mean Judah would once again enjoy full control of her territory, while a spiritual change would fit the context well as the high point of a development that began with cessation of punishment for Judah's sin in Nahum 1:12 and included Judah's thankful celebration of God's deliverance in 1:15. Both meanings encourage Judah to continue trusting the Lord and highlight her dependence upon him for her spiritual and political well-being.

<span id="page-520-8"></span><span id="page-520-7"></span><span id="page-520-6"></span><span id="page-520-5"></span><span id="page-520-4"></span><span id="page-520-2"></span>2:3–10 Beginning in verse 3, the reader watches as the future battle for Nineveh unfolds in eight consecutive scenes. The first scene (v. 3) focuses on the approaching army, under the control of the "scatterer" (v. 1). Its expensive clothing, flashing chariots, and brandished spears show that it is well prepared and well equipped for the attack. The second scene (v. 4) is set later. In four parallel lines, this verse describes the movement of the attacker's chariots, emphasizing their speed as they attack Nineveh. Sennacherib (704–681 BC) had broadened the streets of Nineveh, and its gates were wide enough for chariots up to 6.5 feet (2 m) wide to pass into the city, and so this scene focuses on the city proper (i.e., within Nineveh's walls).6 Ironically, it is now the enemy's chariots that pass through the gates and streets of the empire's capital city.

<span id="page-520-11"></span>With the enemy already present in Nineveh, the third scene (v. 5) shifts to the Assyrian defenders. The voice calling out to "his officers" (the same term appears in 3:18) is probably that of the king, so that Nineveh's defense involves the empire's primary representative. The image of Assyrian officers stumbling clumsily as they make their way to the wall is in stark contrast to the attacker's rapid and apparently easy progress.

<span id="page-520-10"></span><span id="page-520-9"></span>The ineffective and tardy defense of Nineveh disappears after being mentioned in 2:5, as the remaining scenes predict the fall of the city. The fourth scene (v. 6) describes the opening of the "river gates" and the collapse of the "palace." A canal from the river Khosr some miles away brought water into Nineveh by passing under its eastern wall and leaving the city by way of the western wall, and Sennacherib had built a number of sluice gates upstream to prevent the city's flooding. There is no clear archaeological evidence, however, that water played a major role in Nineveh's fall. How is this to be explained? Several responses have been given. First, the attackers may have caused a minor flood within the city (one that archaeological exploration is unable to detect) by using sluice gates on the Khosr upstream from Nineveh to create a buildup of water that, when turned loose, damaged parts of the city. Second, after the attack ended, the Medo-Babylonian

<sup>6</sup> Daniel D. Luckenbill, *Historical Records from Assyria. From Sargon to the End*, in *Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia*, vol. 2 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1927), 162–163.

attackers may have partially (but not completely) inundated the city in order to seal its destruction symbolically, as Assyria had done to Babylon some seventy years earlier.7 Third, the flood language may simply apply flood imagery to Nineveh in order to announce its complete destruction, without intending to refer to a specific inundation of the city during its fall.

<span id="page-521-1"></span><span id="page-521-0"></span>The fifth scene (v. 7) seems to prophesy the capture and spoiling of a statue of the goddess Ishtar, the patron deity of Nineveh ("its mistress"), whose temple stood near the royal palace in the city's inner citadel. Others have understood "mistress" to refer to the city as a whole or to its king or queen. The verb used here ("stripped"), however, involves a physical object in other contexts (cf. Gen. 28:12 ["set up"]; Judg. 9:6 ["the pillar"]), making a reference to the city less likely, and the grammatically feminine gender of the object probably excludes the king while making possible a reference to Ishtar, often called the "Lady of Nineveh" in Assyrian texts. Further, the practice of taking a god's cult statue into exile is widely attested, and the stripping and carrying away of the image would confirm that the goddess was powerless to defend her residence and chosen city. The laments of her temple personnel also echo those of other ancient Near Eastern texts in which a deity's statue is captured by the enemy and carried away (e.g., the "Lament for Sumer and Urim").

<span id="page-521-3"></span><span id="page-521-2"></span>The sixth, seventh, and eighth scenes foresee events just before and after the city's fall. In Nahum 2:8 the city's defenders are overcome by fear and leave their posts, ignoring their superiors' calls to remain and defend the city. The Assyrian leaders' "Halt! Halt!" is the only time an Assyrian voice is heard in the book, and their desperate pleas make clear that Nineveh has fallen. The next scene (v. 9) also uses a repeated command ("Plunder . . . , plunder . . . !") to depict the other side of the event foreseen in verse 8, with the defenseless city now being looted by the Medo-Babylonian army. Taking spoil from Nineveh is significant because of the immense amount of wealth collected in its treasuries, most of which had come in the form of vassal payments from client states that Assyria exploited, or spoils taken from conquered cities. Just a few years before Nahum wrote, e.g., a royal inscription of Assurbanipal (668–627 BC) boasts that he carried away from Thebes "heavy and countless" spoils, including "silver, gold, precious stones, . . . great horses," and "two tall obelisks, fashioned of glittering electrum, whose weight was 2500 talents."8

<span id="page-521-4"></span>The final scene (v. 10) envisions the result of the attack in three terms whose similar sounds in Hebrew further emphasize the shocking, sudden, and complete fall of Nineveh ("Desolate! Desolation and ruin!"). This triple summary of the city's fall is followed by four lines summarizing the reaction of its inhabitants to the catastrophe. Two of these reactions ("Hearts melt . . . ; anguish is in all loins") describe the internal, emotional effects of this event on the Ninevites, while the

other two ("knees tremble; . . . all faces grow pale") provide visible proof of the dismay and despair of the defeated Assyrians.9

<span id="page-522-7"></span><span id="page-522-4"></span><span id="page-522-2"></span>2:11–13 The last three verses of chapter 2 describe a God-centered response to the fall of Assyria. This response is the very opposite of the one in verse 10 and hints at the joy that will summarize the book's final reaction to the fall of the Assyrian Empire (3:19). This section (2:11–13) focuses on the Assyrian king as the representative of the empire and adopts with great irony his frequent selfdescription as a lion who violently defeats his enemies. In the Assyrian annals, e.g., Adad-Nirari II (911–891 BC) self-identified as "a potent lion,"10 Sargon II (722–705) compared himself to a "wild lion who is lordly with frightfulness" on the battlefield,11 and Esarhaddon (680–669) purported that he "raged like a lion" against his enemies.12

<span id="page-522-5"></span><span id="page-522-3"></span>Verse 11 of chapter 2 applies this image to Assyria by sketching a picture of a large pride (family) of lions made up of the dominant male, his lionesses, and several generations of young, emphasizing the security of this large pride in and around its den. Verse 12 depicts the lion's violent existence with a wide variety of terms for his hunting activities ("tore . . . strangled") and targets (described as "prey" and "torn flesh"), killed in order to provide for his pride.

<span id="page-522-6"></span><span id="page-522-1"></span>This image, which accurately reflects much Neo-Assyrian ideology, is radically undone by the Lord's response (v. 13). Much like his words to the Assyrian king in 1:14, here the Lord speaks directly to the Assyrian ruler and commits to destroying him and his empire because of the idolatrous and immoral violence by which it pursued material wealth and glory. God solemnly promises to destroy the empire's army and its "messengers" (diplomats) responsible for negotiating treaties and delivering the king's edicts to client states (cf. Isa. 36:13–20; 37:9–13).13

### <span id="page-522-0"></span>*Response*

In contrast to the Assyrian Empire's descriptions of its military victories, Nahum's description of Nineveh's fall is almost entirely without explicit violence. By presenting the punishment of Assyria in this way, the book avoids creating a vindictive bloodlust in its readers (who are not directed to impose this punishment themselves). The arrival of the kingdom of heaven in Christ's earthly ministry is likewise without violence (cf. John 18:36), and its growth comes only

Prior to the end of this age, therefore, the church is to beseech even Christ's overt enemies to "be reconciled to God" (2 Cor. 5:20). In doing so, she participates in a mission that is in the deepest sense Christ's own mission (cf. Acts 13:47 and Isa. 49:6).

<span id="page-523-8"></span><span id="page-523-6"></span><span id="page-523-0"></span>No less importantly, this passage focuses on the Lord's commitment to eliminate a very visible incarnation of evil from the ancient Near East. The fact that Nahum delivered his oracles prior to the fall of Nineveh is a powerful reminder that believers can have confidence that in due time God himself will deal with evil in general, with their persecutors in particular, and indeed with the Devil himself (Rev. 20:10). This section's detailed presentation of Nineveh's fall, and the ease with which her enemies overcome her defenses, gives God's people added grounds for confidence in Jesus' assurance that he has overcome the world (John 16:33) and that it is therefore impossible for the gates of Hades to resist the progress of his kingdom (Matt. 16:18).

The book of Acts begins its narrative with Christ's ascension and the inauguration of his kingly rule before recounting in detail the empowered and successful testimony of the apostles, even including occasional confirmation in the physical realm of the exalted Christ's irresistible power in the face of opposition (e.g., Acts 4). The resurrected and exalted Christ's infinite power and reign are more than adequate to reassure believes that their spiritual foes are fully under his control and will one day be vanquished.

## *Section Overview*

The final chapter of Nahum focuses on how God's punishment of Assyria's evil strips it of its pride. The passage includes several taunts scornfully dismissing the empire's power, claims, and accomplishments, and it closes by informing the Assyrian king that his death is imminent and the empire will pass away with him, putting an end to its wrongs.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-525-0"></span>3:1–7 Chapter 3 begins with a woe oracle, a literary form that announces "Woe!" upon the guilty, brings charges against them, and concludes by pronouncing <span id="page-526-2"></span>judgment. Far from being a lament over the fate of the guilty party, a woe oracle has the same function as an oracle of judgment. The oracle that begins Nahum 3 makes extensive accusations against Assyria, all of which are summarized in the charges that Nineveh is a "bloody city, all full of lies and plunder," and that its "prey" is endless (v. 1). These accusations are then developed in sometimes horrible detail in verses 2–4, which first focuses on a typical Assyrian military victory that causes extensive loss of life (vv. 2–3) before highlighting the deceptive tactics the empire sometimes used to convince other states to begin or continue a vassal relationship with the empire (v. 4).

<span id="page-526-5"></span><span id="page-526-4"></span><span id="page-526-3"></span><span id="page-526-1"></span><span id="page-526-0"></span>The OT records an example of such diplomacy in its descriptions of the Assyrian attack on Jerusalem in 701 BC, during which Assyrian officials claimed that the Lord had commanded Assyria to destroy Judah (2 Kings 18:25), who would nevertheless benefit from the empire's care and generosity (vv. 31–32). In Nahum 3:4, this practice of exploiting others prompts Nahum to describe the empire as a prostitute who is the only party that benefits from her relationships with her clients, whom she betrays. The scope of Assyria's imperial enterprise, and its human cost, are emphasized by describing the "countless" instances in which this behavior affected different "nations" and "peoples."

<span id="page-526-6"></span>Unlike most of the other punishments of Assyria's sin described in Nahum, the public shaming in verses 5–7 does not involve Assyria's destruction. Instead it focuses on removing the basis for the empire's pride and replacing it with shame. The fact that prostitutes and others who violated sexual or ethical norms in the ancient Near East were sometimes punished by public stripping best explains the imagery here.15 The metaphorical description of the stripping avoids overtones of sexual violence, focusing instead on the shame and disgrace that result from being seen naked. The shame of the Assyrian Empire, witnessed by the nations around her, undoes her false claims to glory and unlimited power while also showing that her control over the subject nations was never intended to do them good. The reaction of the nations to this revelation is telling: seeing what Assyria has kept hidden (her deceptive and self-serving diplomacy), and realizing that what she had claimed (the exclusive right and ability to control the ancient Near East through military might with the support of her gods) was untrue, not one bystander will mourn for or comfort the devastated empire—not even the Lord himself.

<span id="page-526-8"></span><span id="page-526-7"></span>3:8–11 The next three sections (vv. 8–11, 12–15c, 15d–17) are taunts that bring shame on Assyria directly. Each taunt asserts (contrary to Assyria's claims) that the empire is inferior with respect to some point of comparison, whether a historical reality (e.g., Thebes) or one of the empire's claims (e.g., to military invincibility).

The first taunt (vv. 8–11) compares Nineveh to the Egyptian city of Thebes, which Assyria had conquered in 663 BC as punishment for Egypt's decision to

<sup>15</sup> See Martha T. Roth, *Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor*, 2nd ed., WAW 6 (Atlanta: Scholars, 1997), 167–169 (Middle Assyrian Laws A40); cf. also the Sefire treaty: "[And just as] a [ha]r[lot is stripped naked], so may the wives of Mati'el be stripped naked . . ." (J. A. Fitzmeyer, trans., "The Inscriptions of Bar-Ga'yah and Matiʻel from Sefire," in William W. Hallo, ed., *The Context of Scripture* [Leiden: Brill, 1997], 2:214).

stop fulfilling its duties as a vassal state. Thebes was hundreds of miles south of Egypt's northeast border and so was presumed to be safe from an Assyrian threat. The description of Thebes as surrounded by water is probably meant to parallel Nineveh's water defenses (moats, etc.) even though the Nile, which ran through the center of Thebes, would have done little to protect the city from an attack.16 Although there was no wall surrounding Thebes, many of its royal temples were surrounded by sizable walls, which are compared to immense water defenses in verse 8.17

<span id="page-527-5"></span><span id="page-527-4"></span>In addition to its safe location and defensive features, Thebes (as part of Egypt) could also have drawn on the military support of its numerous allies: "Cush . . . Put and the Libyans" (v. 9). Despite these advantages, Thebes fell to Assyria and suffered the shame and violence that came with defeat: citizens taken into exile, children slaughtered, men sold into slavery or taken as captives of war (v. 10). Applying the picture of violent defeat to Nineveh, verse 11 focuses on its drunkenness (implying it has drunk deeply from the cup of the Lord's wrath; cf. Isa. 49:26; Jer. 49:12; etc.) and its vain effort to escape capture and destruction by attempting to hide from its attackers.

<span id="page-527-6"></span><span id="page-527-3"></span><span id="page-527-1"></span>Thus the surprising fall of a large city apparently far from danger, deep within an empire, with numerous allies and significant defenses, provides Nahum with an example that he applies to Nineveh, which despite its even more impressive defenses will also fall. The point of the comparison in Nahum 3:8 is not that Thebes had superior defenses (it did not) but that the final condition of Nineveh will be no better than that of Thebes ("Are you better than Thebes . . . ?" can also be translated "Will it go better for you than it did for Thebes?").

<span id="page-527-8"></span><span id="page-527-7"></span>3:12–15c The second taunt (vv. 12–15c) attacks Assyria's military resources. Two specific comparisons impress upon the reader Assyria's inability to resist the attack that will soon bring about its fall. The first deals with its "fortresses" (v. 12), cities with military garrisons and supply centers that served as the starting point for campaigns outside the empire's borders and as the first point of defense in the event of an invasion. Despite their fortifications and the resistance that would surely come from the troops garrisoned there, these fortified cities are compared to "fig trees," which when shaken inevitably drops their "figs." This image accentuates the superiority of the attacker (in the metaphor, either an animal or a human being) over the figs it will eat, which are nothing more than a source of food.

<span id="page-527-9"></span>The taunt's second element compares Assyria's (all-male) military force to women (v. 13). Because physical strength was a key element in ancient warfare, this taunt is practical rather than sexist. Assyria's troops will no more be able to resist their foes than women in the ancient Near East were able to resist a victorious attacking army, which did as it pleased with female captives. To this the taunt

<span id="page-527-2"></span><span id="page-527-0"></span><sup>16</sup> It may also be noted that the Hebrew word for "sea" can be used to refer to major rivers (cf. Isa. 18:1–2; Jer. 51:36).

<sup>17</sup> See S. Aufrère, J.-C. Golvin, and J.-C. Goyon, *L'Égypte restituée: Sites et temples de haute Égypte (1650 av J.-C.–300 ap J.-C.)* (Paris: Editions Errance, 1991), 171–184.

adds that the "gates" and "bars" of its cities will be easily overcome; even if its "wide open" gates are closed before the attacker arrives, the bars holding them closed would soon be burned and the cities would fall.

<span id="page-528-1"></span><span id="page-528-0"></span>Building on these two negative comparisons, the taunt adds a sarcastic series of commands to prepare for an apparently imminent attack. The five commands of verse 14 ("draw water . . . ; strengthen . . . ; go . . . ; tread . . . ; take hold") mention the most basic need of the defenders—water—but place their main focus on the need to fortify Assyria's defenses by preparing bricks to "strengthen your forts." The sarcastic tone is clear not only because the taunt has already announced that the cities would fall to their attackers (v. 13) but also because the very process of fortifying them has been interrupted. The activities described in verse 14 present the defenders as having mixed mortar and clay, but before a single brick is made, much less dried and then added to the defenses, "the fire will devour" them and "the sword will cut [them] off" (v. 15). Assyria's defensive preparations cannot prevent its fall, and the attacker will completely devour it "like the locust" devours vegetation.

<span id="page-528-4"></span><span id="page-528-3"></span><span id="page-528-2"></span>3:15d–17 The locust mentioned in verse 15c links the second taunt to the third (vv. 15d–17), which deals with Assyria's economic and diplomatic personnel. By the seventh century BC, Assyria had developed domestic and international economic structures enabling it to draw profit from conquered territories and to enjoy favorable trading relations with independent states. Numerous personnel were involved in conducting and regulating this key element of the empire. Nahum sarcastically urges the empire to multiply its economic personnel further, like the locust and the grasshopper, only to announce that even though Assyria "increased" its "merchants" and had innumerable "princes" and "scribes," they would be of no lasting use; instead, they will fly away like a locust (v. 16) or a grasshopper (v. 17) that disappears without a trace.

<span id="page-528-7"></span><span id="page-528-5"></span>3:18–19 The book's final section is a sort of dirge for the Assyrian king. While a typical dirge laments someone's death by stressing their value and good qualities and noting that their passing leaves a painful void, this dirge does the opposite.18 Although it is addressed to the king, it mentions key aspects of the empire as well, consistently tying them to the king to make clear that his death is inseparable from the empire's demise. Further, it asserts that even now the king has failed to protect his empire, and so its irreversible fall has already begun.

<span id="page-528-6"></span>Although the Assyrian king often referred to himself as a shepherd able to protect his people from any and all threats, here "shepherds" refers to his "nobles" or ministers, who were more directly responsible than the king for the well-being of the empire (v. 18). Both shepherds and nobles are sleeping, which explains why the people (like the sheep of a sleeping shepherd) are scattered on the mountains. Since there is no one to gather the scattered sheep, there seems to be no possibility

<sup>18</sup> See the discussion of dirges in Greg Schmidt Goering, "Proleptic Fulfillment of the Prophetic Word: Ezekiel's Dirges over Tyre and Its Ruler," *JSOT* 36/4 (2012): 483–505.

that the shepherds or nobles will wake up. It is therefore inevitable that the scattered sheep will sooner or later fall victim to predators or other dangers.

The dirge finally turns to the king himself (v. 19), announcing that although he is still alive, his wounds are fatal and his death certain. The news that the Assyrian king has been fatally wounded is ironic, since Assyrian kings sometimes recounted in their royal annals that they had inflicted such incurable wounds on their enemies. Judah and the other nations the king has oppressed and dominated for so long have only to wait for his imminent death. His death is a source of joy to the nations that have suffered exploitation and violence at the empire's hands, and the end of such oppression is cause for celebration (signified by clapping one's hands; Ps. 47:1; cf. also, with other Hebrew verbs, Ps. 98:8; Isa. 55:12).

<span id="page-529-3"></span><span id="page-529-1"></span><span id="page-529-0"></span>The book's closing lines connect the fall of Assyria to the opening hymn's focus on God's commitment to destroy all evil (cf. Nah. 1:2–8). The term "evil" (3:19) appears elsewhere in Nahum only in 1:11, where it described Assyrian plots against the Lord. Those plots were particular manifestations of the animosity and autonomy that God's enemies pursue in opposition to him, so the certainty of the fall of the Assyrian king and his empire in 3:18–19 is ultimately due to God's unshakable commitment to overcome and destroy evil as he saves and protects his people. This connection between the destruction of God's enemies and the deliverance of those who trust in him makes the message of Nahum good "news" despite its focus on the destructive side of this reality.

### *Response*

<span id="page-529-4"></span>God's destruction of Assyria is the exercise of his justice against evil. The taunts of chapter 3 encourage any believer deeply troubled by the presence of evil in his life, and in the world around him, to remain calm in the knowledge that the Lord's justice will one day bring evil to an end despite its apparent strength. Much like 1:9–15, this passage expresses the confident hope that God will finally eliminate all evil and encourages joy in anticipation of this outcome.

<span id="page-529-6"></span><span id="page-529-5"></span><span id="page-529-2"></span>From a NT perspective, the resurrection of Jesus Christ provides believers with unshakeable grounds for hope and joy, even amid persecution (1 Pet. 1:3–9). We can rejoice even in difficulty as we look forward to the full destruction of evil and our entry into the new heaven and the new earth when Christ returns as victorious king (Rev. 19:11–22:5).

# HABAKKUK

*David G. Firth*

## INTRODUCTION TO HABAKKUK

### *Overview*

<span id="page-535-2"></span><span id="page-535-1"></span><span id="page-535-0"></span>The book of Habakkuk consists of a series of dialogues between the prophet Habakkuk and God that wrestle with the issue of God's justice. The prophet is initially challenged by the rise of violence within Judah and complains about it to God. God responds by saying he will raise up the Chaldeans (a Semitic people from Mesopotamia who came to dominate Babylon and thus are often referred to as Babylonians) as an instrument of judgment upon Judah, leading Habakkuk to complain that the solution seems worse than the initial problem. But God responds once more, summoning Habakkuk to faith (2:4). In light of this, the prophet proclaims a series of woe oracles (2:6–20), recognizing that God's justice will ultimately be seen. Habakkuk's own response, presented as a model for all, is then expressed in prayer in chapter 3. This prayer, drawing on many other parts of the OT, celebrates the fact that God comes in victory. Habakkuk is thus able to declare that he can rejoice in God in even the most trying circumstances, recognizing the certainty of God's ultimate victory. Understanding that God's victory will ultimately be seen, rather than focusing only on present circumstances, becomes the means of resolving Habakkuk's questions regarding God's justice.

### <span id="page-535-3"></span>*Author*

Nothing is known about Habakkuk other than that he was a prophet.

<span id="page-535-4"></span>Considerable debate has focused on the question of whether or not chapter 3 is an integral part of the book. Its separate title (3:1) and colophon (3:19b) clearly mark it off from the rest of the book, and its archaic language is quite different from the first two chapters. Moreover, although commonly translated that way, the title (3:1) does not necessarily affirm that Habakkuk is the author. However, without chapter 3 the issue of God's justice is left unresolved, whereas its inclusion allows this key matter to be brought to a close. Although the language is different, the extent of allusions to other parts of Scripture, and perhaps other ancient hymns, suggests that Habakkuk is intentionally reworking traditional material in this prayer in order to address the issues at hand. All in all, it seems likely that chapter 3 is an intentional part of the book and should be attributed to Habakkuk.

## *Date and Occasion*

A near contemporary of Nahum, Habakkuk is writing perhaps only ten to twelve years later. Yet his is a startlingly different work. By his time, Nineveh (the main audience of Nahum's ministry) had already fallen, and the final conflict between Babylon and Assyria was near. If he were writing after the Battle of Carchemish (605 BC), his fears must have been greatly clarified. By that time Babylon was clearly the major world power, having defeated the Assyrians and Egyptians, even if some of the details of how that would work out were still to be resolved. The few years' difference between these two prophets (Nahum and Habakkuk) allows us to clarify their differing perspectives. Whereas Nahum could rejoice in the coming destruction of Nineveh, Habakkuk wrestles with the question of how to deal with a new power that seems no better than the previous one. All of this suggests that Habakkuk was most likely written between the final overthrow of Assyrian power at Carchemish in 605 and the invasion of Judah by Babylon in 597. It is the chaos of this period, with problems within Judah as well as pressure from without, that makes the issue of God's justice so important.

## *Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-536-1"></span>Habakkuk is distinct from the other Prophetic Books in that it is predominantly composed of dialogues between the prophet and God. This is particularly evident in 1:1–2:5 and 3:1–19, but even the woe oracles of 2:6–20 are to be included in this dialogue. However, although the book does not contain the type of preaching most commonly found in the Prophetic Books, it is still presented as a word from God. It is as Habakkuk, "the prophet" (1:1; 3:1), wrestles with God in his dialogues, and ultimately in prayer, that this is also God's Word to us.

## <span id="page-536-0"></span>*Theology of Habakkuk*

<span id="page-536-3"></span><span id="page-536-2"></span>Understanding God's justice is the central issue in Habakkuk. Faced with violence within Judah (1:3–4) and God's promise to raise up the Chaldeans in response, Habakkuk struggles to understand how God can be just; how could he permit such abuses among and on his people? After all, if God is good, holy, and just, should not he keep his people from such experiences? Indeed, how could he use violence for his purposes? This seems to be central to the complaints Habakkuk makes in 1:2–4 and 1:12–2:1. The turning point is found in God's response in 2:2–5, in which he summons Habakkuk to a life of faith, trusting that justice will be done even if its timing is unknown. It is in light of this that Habakkuk is able to declare woes on the oppressors (2:6–20) and offer his own prayer as an expression of that faith (3:1–19), knowing it is possible to rejoice in God no matter the circumstances.

## *Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-536-5"></span><span id="page-536-4"></span>Habakkuk 2:4 is a crucial verse for the NT, cited twice by Paul (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11) and once in Hebrews (Heb. 10:37–38). None of these citations exploits the whole of this verse, but they show that the faith summoned from Habakkuk is <span id="page-537-2"></span><span id="page-537-1"></span>both a commitment to God and a life lived in light of that commitment. Yet the significance of Habakkuk for the NT is wider than this. Paul's declaration that he could do all things through Christ (Phil. 4:10–13) draws on Habakkuk 3:16–19, while the announcement of Christ's final victory (Rev. 19:11–21) draws on themes developed in Habakkuk 3:2–15.

## <span id="page-537-0"></span>*Preaching from Habakkuk*

Although only a short book, there is much in Habakkuk that should be explored by preachers. It can easily be addressed in three or four sermons by those wishing to expound the whole book and its key themes. Preachers will need to attend to the book's particular literary form and recognize that, although it is finally a prophetic work, its constituent parts have more in common with various psalms. There is one key temptation that should probably be avoided: focusing only on the book's conclusion (3:16–19). Although it is an attractive text, the conclusion emerges from a book where each part builds on what has gone before, and congregations need to appreciate how this conclusion derives from a serious engagement with the issues of God's justice if they are to appreciate just how radical it is.

<span id="page-538-0"></span>1 The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw. **<sup>2</sup>** O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you "Violence!" and you will not save? **<sup>3</sup>** Why do you make me see iniquity, and why do you idly look at wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise. **<sup>4</sup>** So the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; so justice goes forth perverted. **<sup>5</sup>** "Look among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told. **<sup>6</sup>** For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who march through the breadth of the earth, to seize dwellings not their own. **<sup>7</sup>** They are dreaded and fearsome; their justice and dignity go forth from themselves. **<sup>8</sup>** Their horses are swifter than leopards, more fierce than the evening wolves; their horsemen press proudly on. Their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle swift to devour. **<sup>9</sup>** They all come for violence, all their faces forward. They gather captives like sand. **<sup>10</sup>** At kings they scoff, and at rulers they laugh. They laugh at every fortress, for they pile up earth and take it. **<sup>11</sup>** Then they sweep by like the wind and go on, guilty men, whose own might is their god!"

**<sup>12</sup>** Are you not from everlasting, O Lord my God, my Holy One? We shall not die.

- O Lord, you have ordained them as a judgment, and you, O Rock, have established them for reproof.
- **<sup>13</sup>** You who are of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong, why do you idly look at traitors and remain silent when the wicked swallows up
- the man more righteous than he? **<sup>14</sup>** You make mankind like the fish of the sea, like crawling things that have no ruler.
- **<sup>15</sup>** He*<sup>1</sup>* brings all of them up with a hook; he drags them out with his net; he gathers them in his dragnet; so he rejoices and is glad.
- **<sup>16</sup>** Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his dragnet; for by them he lives in luxury,*<sup>2</sup>* and his food is rich.
- **<sup>17</sup>** Is he then to keep on emptying his net and mercilessly killing nations forever?

2 I will take my stand at my watchpost and station myself on the tower, and look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.

**<sup>2</sup>**And the Lord answered me:

"Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it.

## *Section Overview*

This passage introduces us to the complex and challenging message of Habakkuk. We immediately notice something radically different here compared to other prophets. Generally, we think of prophecy as a message from God that the prophet

is to announce to the people, perhaps marked by a phrase such as "Thus says the Lord." But, following a superscription, this first passage in Habakkuk is a prayer. As the book progresses the prophet twice speaks to God and receives a response from him, so that as readers of the text we overhear their discussion.

<span id="page-540-1"></span><span id="page-540-0"></span>There is a close relationship between Habakkuk and the Psalms, some of which also have a combination of prayer to God and a response from him. Perhaps the closest analogy is Psalm 50, in which the psalmist speaks (Ps. 50:1–4) and God responds (vv. 5–15). The psalmist then introduces a message to the wicked (v. 16a) and recounts God's speech (vv. 16b–23). In Habakkuk, as in Psalm 50, a dialogue with God becomes God's word to his people as the text is passed on to Israel and to us.

<span id="page-540-5"></span><span id="page-540-2"></span>This dialogue is shaped around concerns with what God and Habakkuk see, with a particular focus on the problems of injustice and violence. For Habakkuk, a basic problem of divine justice needs resolution: can God permit violence to continue? More pressingly, can he use the wicked to achieve his purposes? What Habakkuk sees happening leads him to characterize his prayer as a complaint (Hab. 2:1), and to this complaint God provides his famous response in 2:4–5, establishing a key motif for the whole book. "Faith" here means trusting God and believing that his justice will finally be seen. This understanding of faith leads immediately to the woe oracles of the rest of chapter 2, which both demonstrate that God is indeed just and also prepare for the prayer of chapter 3 and its expressions of trust amid uncertainty. Habakkuk's own engagement with God in prayer becomes God's word to his people, so that Habakkuk's journey into trusting faith can provide a pattern for believers through the ages as they wrestle with how God's justice is worked out in experience.

## *Comment*

1:1 While many Prophetic Books provide information about the prophet's setting, usually referring to the kings who reigned at the time of the prophet's ministry, all such information is ignored here in a very brief superscription (only Obadiah's superscription is briefer). We are simply told we are reading an "oracle" that Habakkuk "saw." Not all prophetic preaching is called an "oracle," with the term occurring elsewhere in the OT eighteen times to describe a prophetic mes<span id="page-541-2"></span>sage, most commonly one concerning another nation, including eleven times in Isaiah 13–30. What is striking is that in every other instance the concern of the oracle is mentioned, but that is not the case here. Readers familiar with oracles are thus left in a state of uncertainty—does the text address them, or a foreign nation? In fact, both will be addressed, but by leaving this unstated the superscription invites readers to continue in order to discover the object of the oracle.

<span id="page-541-4"></span>Habakkuk himself is introduced as "the prophet"; only Haggai and Zechariah are similarly designated (Hag. 1:1; Zech. 1:1). Usually, prophetic superscriptions indicate that the book records the message of a prophet (e.g., "The word of the Lord came to . . ."), but such information is absent here, precisely because Habakkuk's oracle comes not in the form of a direct word but rather as a mediated conversation. Readers are thus informed that the conversation to follow is to be read as a prophetic message, although it is also something that Habakkuk "saw." The idea of a prophet seeing an oracle might seem strange, but the concept is quite common in the Prophetic Books (e.g., Isa. 1:1; 2:1) and appears to describe the process by which the prophet was able to perceive God's message. If so, it functions here to assure readers of the authenticity of what follows, and also prepares them for a range of words associated with sight that will be prominent in the remainder of this section.

<span id="page-541-3"></span><span id="page-541-1"></span><span id="page-541-0"></span>1:2–4 Most prophets begin by announcing a word from or about God; Habakkuk starts instead with a record of his own address to God. His address finds its nearest parallels in the Psalms, and some of Jeremiah's confessions are also similar. Habakkuk's opening words find an immediate parallel in Psalm 13:1, another prayer complaining about a delay in God's justice. The question of why God does not act against evil in the world is thus raised from the outset as the pivotal issue of the book. Habakkuk's point is that the issues he raises are not new concerns but rather are matters he has been presenting to God for some time. Although he has raised the issue of violence, which here describes abuse of the weak within society, it seems that God has not acted. Indeed, what particularly troubles the prophet is that God has caused him to look upon iniquity, while God himself appears untroubled to look upon oppression.

That these are not isolated experiences is made clear by the range of terms for the social decay Habakkuk describes. A world that is full of "destruction" and "violence" is also one that will be filled with "contention" and "strife." The whole of the prophet's society is decaying, and, as far as he can see, God is not troubled by it. At the heart of Habakkuk's concern is that God's justice ought to be seen—and promptly. Also central to Habakkuk's unease is that the "law is paralyzed." Since "law" (*torah*) represents Israel's instruction received from God, the implication is that the problems described are internal to Judah. Habakkuk is troubled that Israel's law appears powerless to address the problems he sees. That which was meant to guarantee the application of God's justice seems powerless in the face of violence, with the righteous unable to overcome the wicked. It is this that leads to Habakkuk's cry to God for help.

<span id="page-542-4"></span>1:5–11 It is often suggested that one reason we frequently see a shift in mood in the Psalms from complaint to hope is that the petitioner has received an oracle from God, perhaps through a prophet, that gives him hope. There is no direct evidence for this in the Psalms, but we may see something like it here, save for one important distinction: Habakkuk does indeed receive a response to his complaint from God, but he does not find it comforting. That we have a new speaker is indicated by a change to plural verbs, and the "I" who speaks has great authority. Nevertheless, as verse 5 begins, we do not know who is speaking, only that the speaker has the right to direct Habakkuk (and others) to look to the nations. Only gradually do we realize that it is Yahweh who speaks, though this is not finally confirmed until Habakkuk initiates the second dialogue in verse 12. The plural verbs used here imply that Habakkuk is part of a group, suggesting he has not been alone in his complaint, and neither will he be alone in his astonishment at what is about to be described.

<span id="page-542-8"></span><span id="page-542-2"></span><span id="page-542-0"></span>Presumably, Habakkuk is included among the righteous who are surrounded by the wicked in verse 4, and this group is collectively summoned to look to the nations and be amazed at what God is about to do, as what is about to happen is something none of them would have expected. This is because, in response to the internal problem of injustice in Judah, God announces he is raising up the Chaldeans (a term roughly equivalent to "Babylonians"; cf. Introduction: Overview) to act. This statement is closely parallel to Amos 6:14, where the Assyrians were to be raised up against Israel, suggesting that this whole response to Habakkuk is in effect a judgment against Judah. However, a description of how exactly they will judge Judah is withheld at this point. What is to amaze the righteous in Judah is that God would use a people like the Chaldeans, who by this time were already known for their militaristic and expansionist policies against other nations. It is astonishing that so violent a people would be used to address the violence occurring in Judah. If the problem is injustice, how could God use a nation whose own idea of justice is so contrary to God's?

<span id="page-542-5"></span>The Lord then describes the Chaldeans as dreaded and fearsome. Although the translation of these verses is far from easy, the ESV makes good sense of them, helping us to see how terrifying the Chaldeans would be. But their description also raises important questions for readers. This problem is exacerbated by the picture of the Chaldeans' powerful and swift horsemen, who are compared to creatures of prey, swift to enact violence (Hab. 1:8–9), the very issue Habakkuk had raised in verse 2. Habakkuk had asked God to save, but instead he is bringing a powerful nation that scoffs at kings (vv. 9–10), and that does not recognize Yahweh's authority—for their "own might is their god" (v. 11). That God should use a violent and guilty people against violence within Judah is almost certainly not the response Habakkuk had sought.

<span id="page-542-9"></span><span id="page-542-7"></span><span id="page-542-6"></span><span id="page-542-3"></span><span id="page-542-1"></span>1:12–2:1 God had declared (1:5) that his message would astonish Habakkuk (and others), and it is immediately clear that it has indeed done so. Once again, a change <span id="page-543-3"></span>in speaker is clear as Habakkuk addresses Yahweh. This address, again like many psalms, uses a range of titles to address God: he is "from everlasting," "my God," and "my Holy One" (the third one being unique to Habakkuk). These terms create a clear contrast between God and the Chaldeans, although the clause "We shall not die" (1:12) is difficult to interpret and is frequently emended. The ESV faithfully represents the Hebrew and can be defended, the sense perhaps being an exclamation of faith by Habakkuk as he prepares to "take my stand at my watchpost" (2:1). He thus recognizes Yahweh as his "Rock" (1:12), a term used for God twenty-four times in the Psalms to suggest security and stability.

<span id="page-543-10"></span><span id="page-543-5"></span><span id="page-543-4"></span><span id="page-543-2"></span>Although he recognizes the threat the Chaldeans pose, Habakkuk believes his life is safe precisely because of God's character. Yet this assurance must be balanced in verses 12b–14 by the reality of "judgment" (the same word as that translated "justice" in vv. 4, 7). Habakkuk tries to understand the Chaldean threat as reproof, presumably for the righteous as well as for the wicked, but Habakkuk's difficulty is that he knows Yahweh to be holy and therefore pure. This conflict leads to the questions of verse 13, as Habakkuk remains troubled that Yahweh does not act directly to prevent injustice, allowing treachery to continue. Yahweh has failed to act against those characterized in the Hebrew of verse 13 as *bogedim*, referring to either "traitors" (so ESV, suggesting wicked Israelites) or "the treacherous" (suggesting the Chaldeans). In either case, Habakkuk is concerned by Yahweh's seemingly delayed judgment on unfaithful Israel being meted out by even more unfaithful Babylon. Habakkuk thus wishes to hold God to account—he is holy and just, and therefore ought to act in ways that are likewise holy and just.

<span id="page-543-7"></span><span id="page-543-6"></span>That God is sovereign is clear from the fact that he is Creator, and Habakkuk (with a nod to Genesis 1) sees that God has made mankind free, comparing humans to "fish" and "crawling things" (Hab. 1:14). The comparison to fish, however, leads to the metaphor of the Chaldeans as ruthless anglers who catch more than they need through a variety of fishing techniques—"hook," "net," and "dragnet" (v. 15). They rejoice in the abundance of their catch and completely ignore the fact that they could do so only because Yahweh had raised them up. Indeed, they treat their fishing implements as gods (v. 16), celebrating their violence in battle.

<span id="page-543-9"></span><span id="page-543-8"></span><span id="page-543-0"></span>The point of Habakkuk's complaint is then driven home by the question of verse 17. He objects to the Chaldeans' relentlessly violent and aggressive conquests of other nations. His question involves a wordplay impossible to bring out in English, as the word translated "net" (*herem*) in verses 15 and 17 is a homonym of the word often translated "devoted to destruction" (e.g., Deut. 7:26), pointing to the Chaldeans' relentless destruction of others.1 Pitiless killing, says Habakkuk, surely cannot be Yahweh's way. So, having challenged God, in 2:1 Habakkuk takes his stand, portraying himself as a prophet in a watchtower, waiting to see what God will say in response to his complaint. This stance recognizes that God has made him see iniquity (1:3), and now he wants to see how God will respond to his

<span id="page-543-1"></span><sup>1</sup> The term also represents the weapon the chief Babylonian god Marduk used to kill Tiamat in Babylonian mythology. It is unclear, however, if that is being alluded to here.

<span id="page-544-4"></span>"complaint," a word related to the term translated "reproof" in verse 12. Habakkuk has challenged God to show his justice, and as a prophet he now waits for a message to bring to the people.

<span id="page-544-5"></span><span id="page-544-2"></span><span id="page-544-1"></span><span id="page-544-0"></span>2:2–5 For the first time, Yahweh is identified as the speaker as Habakkuk receives the response to his complaint. The text here draws parallels between Habakkuk and Moses: Habakkuk is told to write down his "vision" (a noun related to the verb "saw" in 1:1) and to do so plainly "on tablets." The word translated "tablets" is the same as that used for the tablets of the law seventeen times in Exodus (e.g., Ex. 24:12), while the verb translated "make it plain" occurs elsewhere only in Deuteronomy 1:5 and 27:8, the latter reference also referring to something written. The point is that what God has to say to Habakkuk is important and must be shared, just as Deuteronomy was meant to be passed on from generation to generation. It is likely that the one who "runs" (cf. Hab. 2:5) is a messenger who takes a copy of the tablets in order to read it in public. However, before the vision is revealed ("vision" functions here as a technical way of referring to the prophetic message), we are told that those who hear it are not to be disheartened by any delay in its fulfillment. Its completion is certain—it is from Yahweh, and he has set an appointed time for it.

<span id="page-544-9"></span><span id="page-544-8"></span><span id="page-544-6"></span>The content of the vision could be verse 4 (and perhaps v. 5), which would be a word of comfort, although the concern of delay (v. 3) would not seem relevant in that case. Most likely, then, the content of the vision is found in the series of woe oracles in verses 6–20, with verses 4–5 representing the attitude with which they should be read; appreciation of what God was saying required a proper attitude, one that was distinctively unlike the Chaldeans'. Verse 4 is, of course, famous because of its three citations in the NT (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:37–38), as well as its role in the Reformation, but, given the rather different ways the NT applies the text, it is clear that none of them sums up the text in its entirety.

<span id="page-544-10"></span><span id="page-544-7"></span><span id="page-544-3"></span>"His" and "him" in the first half of Habakkuk 2:4 refers to the Chaldeans, following the pattern set in God's previous speech (1:5–11), where Babylon was personified (in the Hebrew) as "he," rightly translated as plurals in the ESV in terms of its sense. The downside to this translation is that readers in English might miss this reference to the Chaldeans here in verse 4, although it is true that *anyone* not submitting to God is "not upright." The Chaldeans are described as "puffed up"; they overrate their own importance and are thus not upright. In contrast the righteous, those who are right with God, will live by faith. Living "by faith" here has two aspects, both of which are equally important. First, it refers to an attitude of life lived in dependence on God. One's faith is foundational to righteousness, as Paul repeatedly makes clear. But it also involves "faithfulness" (ESV mg.), calling for a recognition of God's trustworthiness, even when circumstances are challenging. It is this sense that is taken up by the writer to the Hebrews.

Having established a pattern for the righteous, verse 5 then returns to the Chaldeans, again personifying them as an individual ("he," etc.). The interpretation of the verse is difficult and disputed, with many preferring to follow a Dead Sea Scroll manuscript and read "wealth" (ESV mg.) for the unexpected "wine." If, however, we understand "wine" as representing the luxurious and acquisitive life for which the Chaldeans strove, we can take the text as it stands, pointing to the reality that luxury never satisfies. In the same way, the Chaldeans will find no satisfaction in what they do. Their relentless drive to acquire by force will never satisfy. Just as the grave is never sated, so also the Chaldeans will never find satisfaction. Such a life is ultimately destructive. This gives the righteous another reason to live by faith, even though it does not guarantee they will see such powerful oppression cease. Thus it is important to know that God's purposes will ultimately be worked out, even if his timing is not necessarily ours (cf. 2 Pet. 3:9).

#### <span id="page-545-2"></span>*Response*

Habakkuk raises crucial questions that have bedeviled God's people through the ages, but he also provides a frame of reference by which to see their resolution. He recognizes a fundamental problem: Scripture as a whole consistently affirms that God is good, holy, and just, yet the world is evil, unholy, and unjust—the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer. How are we to understand these seemingly conflicting realities? For Habakkuk, these were not theoretical issues for armchair philosophizing. They were real issues of the world in which he lived, where injustice was rampant in Judah. Yet when he went to God for resolution, it seemed the answer was worse than the problem. He was therefore prepared to hold God to account, challenging him to show his justice.

<span id="page-545-1"></span><span id="page-545-0"></span>The desire to see God's justice still motivates believers today. When Jesus taught us to pray "your kingdom come" (Matt. 6:10), he implicitly reminded us that although the kingdom was indeed present in him and his works (Luke 11:20) it was also future, something for which we are simultaneously to strive and to pray. Faithfulness to Jesus means doing all we can to model holiness and justice while also recognizing that the full revelation of his justice is yet to come. This is a matter for prayer, as modeled to us by Habakkuk, whose message is itself enclosed in his prayers and God's response to them.

God's response to Habakkuk also provides a model for how we are to hold these issues in tension. Faith, a position from which we approach life by understanding that righteousness comes only as God's gift, is the essential starting point. But this is to be matched with a continued faithfulness that trusts God even when our experience is for a time contrary to our expectations. This is not a blind faith, for we understand that violence and injustice has the seeds of its own destruction. But it is a faith that lives in the knowledge that God's purposes have an appointed time for which we wait—waiting both for those interim moments when we see evil overcome in history and for the point at which God's victory will ultimately be seen by all. But as we wait, like Habakkuk, we continue to pray. We pray "your kingdom come," asking for the resolution to this tension and for the faith to endure it in the meantime.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-547-1"></span>After Habakkuk's struggle to understand God, and indeed to hold God to account, we now move to a series of five woe oracles flowing from the earlier discussion. They respond to Habakkuk's complaint about God's justice while also exploring the posture of faith required by 2:4. The woe oracle as a form is derived, though also considerably adapted, from funerary mourning. When addressed to a foreign nation, this funereal element is often ironic, as Israel reflects on the end of an oppressor that is still very much alive.2 The funeral background indicates that "Woe!" should be understood as "Alas!" or "How terrible!" rather than as a gloating over adversaries. If these oracles were addressed to the Chaldeans, as is often understood, then that irony would be present here. However, Habakkuk's first complaint most likely addresses the violence and oppression within Judah, while his second is concerned that Yahweh's response in sending the Chaldeans would only make matters worse. Thus Habakkuk's complaint against God goes in two directions, addressing violence both within and beyond Judah. It therefore follows that God's response must address both sources of violence.

<span id="page-547-3"></span><span id="page-547-2"></span>It is notable that we are never told whom these woe oracles actually address. After the introduction in verse 6, which also refers to an unnamed "him" as the object of what follows, each of the five "Woe" statements (vv. 6b, 9, 12, 15, 19) is followed by a masculine singular participle describing the activities of the one who stands under judgment. Thus, although the woe oracles could be understood in the first instance as being directed against the Chaldeans (as we have noted, they were personified using the Hb. masculine singular in 1:5–11), the oracles can also be understood as addressing those who perpetrated the violence within Judah prompting Habakkuk's initial complaint. To maintain this ambiguity, we shall refer only to "the oppressor" in the comment section. Although it is never stated that Yahweh is the one who will bring the punishments announced in these

<span id="page-547-0"></span><sup>2</sup> See Gary V. Smith, *Interpreting the Prophetic Books: An Exegetical Handbook* (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel, 2014), 37–38.

oracles, they gradually work toward a greater recognition of his involvement in the world.

### *Comment*

2:6–8 Verse 6 does not state who it is that will "take up their taunt against" the oppressor. Who is the "all" that will do so? And why does the verb introducing his/ their speech revert to the singular ("and say")? There is no "all" referred to earlier, so the reference is ambiguous. But, as noted above, Habakkuk makes use of deliberate ambiguity in these woe oracles, so we should not be surprised at such ambiguity here. Just as the identity of the oppressor needs to be left open, so does the identity of those who take up these taunts. In effect, any who has suffered from oppression may give voice to these words.

What is perhaps more surprising is that the terms used to introduce these woe oracles ("taunt," "scoffing," "riddles") are drawn from the vocabulary of wisdom literature, not prophetic speech. Just as his prayers drew on the Psalms, Habakkuk's concern with God's justice draws on the whole range of Israel's traditions. Taking the posture of faith, these oracles draw (especially) on the wisdom tradition to suggest that Yahweh's justice will be vindicated. As wisdom observations, they do not know exactly how this will happen, but they do understand that divine justice will be resolved, treating the oppressor as an object lesson of how justice is ultimately served.

<span id="page-548-4"></span><span id="page-548-2"></span><span id="page-548-1"></span>The first woe properly begins in verse 6b. The concern here is directed against those who accumulate wealth unjustly—both the wicked within Judah (v. 7; cf. 1:4) and the Chaldeans (2:8; cf. 1:6). The oppressor has claimed what is not rightly his, and so he will lose it—the only question being when (2:6b). Although the oppressor has claimed numerous pledges, Habakkuk insists a time will come when those unjustly indebted will arise against the oppressor (v. 8)—the plunderer will become the plunder. This issue is picked up again in verse 17, which repeats the closing lines of verse 8. Justice will finally be done, although it must await its appointed time.

<span id="page-548-6"></span><span id="page-548-0"></span>2:9–11 The second woe also addresses the issue of unjust gain. Such evil gain (*betsaʻ*) is typically associated with violence (e.g., Prov. 28:16; Isa. 56:11) and again reflects the actions of both the wicked within Judah and the Chaldeans in their aggression against the nations—notably, the tribute payments they demanded. The oppressor believes wealth accumulated in this way provides security, raising his house (both the building and the family or nation) beyond the reach of those who would act against it. The oppressor reasons that just as an eagle's nest is secure because of its height (cf. Deut. 32:11; Jer. 49:16; Obad. 4), so wealth accumulated through violence puts his house out of the reach of the oppressed.

<span id="page-549-11"></span><span id="page-549-8"></span><span id="page-549-0"></span>Proverbs 15:27, which perhaps lies in the background here, insists that those who are greedy for such gain bring trouble, not security, to their household. Thus this attempt to create security is actually a means of creating shame, while "cutting off many peoples" (Hab. 2:10) is to forfeit life. Justice will be served, and once again the penalty will match the crime. Indeed, instead of the house being a place of security, its stones and woodwork will "cry out." The oppressor cannot create security; instead, oppressors within Israel will be among the elite either killed or taken in exile to Babylon (Jer. 52:24–30), while Babylon will also find itself unprotected by its wealth (Daniel 5).

<span id="page-549-12"></span><span id="page-549-10"></span><span id="page-549-9"></span><span id="page-549-7"></span>2:12–14 The third woe expands the focus of the second as it considers those who build a city with bloodshed, founding it on violent "iniquity" (cf. the use of the Hb. term *ʻawlah* in 2 Sam. 7:10). Again, this applies equally to those in Jerusalem (perhaps associated with the court of Jehoiakim) who profited from the oppression of the poor and to the Chaldeans who rebuilt Babylon with resources plundered through relentlessly expansionist policies under Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar.

Such actions are clearly unacceptable, but this woe-oracle goes beyond the preceding ones by introducing Yahweh for the first time. Habakkuk moves from simply observing that oppression bears the seeds of its own downfall to noting there is something about Yahweh's involvement in the world that brings about such unexpected results. Habakkuk's use of the title "Yahweh of hosts" (lit.) here is important. Although the origin of this title is disputed, its usage seems particularly concerned with Yahweh's visible control over world events. The name first occurs in the books of Samuel, where it occurs in clusters in the context of significant changes in Israel's social structure.

<span id="page-549-6"></span><span id="page-549-5"></span><span id="page-549-3"></span><span id="page-549-2"></span><span id="page-549-1"></span>For example, it occurs three times in the opening four chapters (1 Sam. 1:3, 11; 4:4) surrounding Samuel's initiation as the last judge of Israel; twice in the middle of the book in the transition from Saul to David (1 Sam. 15:2; 17:45); and then a further seven times as David is established in Jerusalem (2 Sam. 5:10; 6:2, 18; 7:8, 26, 27). It occurs nowhere else in the book. Yet each cluster is notable for the changes described: preparing for monarchy, changing monarchs, and confirming David. David's speech to Goliath particularly recognizes this reality: it was knowing that he came in the name of Yahweh of hosts that assured him Goliath would be defeated (1 Sam. 17:45–46).

<span id="page-549-4"></span>Introducing the divine title here is thus part of Habakkuk's strategy for indicating a deeper reality at work in human history, a power greater than the oppressor. The oppressors' building projects may be intended to point to their grandeur

<span id="page-550-8"></span><span id="page-550-6"></span><span id="page-550-1"></span><span id="page-550-0"></span>(a claim made by Nebuchadnezzar; Dan. 4:30), but Yahweh's sovereign hand means the oppressors will end up toiling for even the basics ("fire" and "nothing"; Hab. 2:13). Instead of the glory of the oppressor, the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Yahweh's glory (v. 14). This glory is a display of God's fundamental character, such as when he allowed Moses to see his glory and so announced himself as merciful, gracious, and just (Ex. 33:17–34:9). The declaration of Habakkuk 2:14 brings together two earlier texts: Numbers 14:21, where the Lord says, "the earth shall be filled with [my] glory"; and Isaiah 11:9, where the prophet declares, "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea." By bringing glory and knowledge together, Habakkuk insists that Yahweh's true character will ultimately be known by all, thus warning the oppressors of their imminent doom if they continue in their oppression.

<span id="page-550-9"></span><span id="page-550-5"></span><span id="page-550-4"></span>2:15–17 The fourth oracle builds on the expressly theological perspective introduced in the third oracle while further depicting how the oppressor belittles others. The oracle uses vivid imagery of the oppressor forcing his victims to drink its wrath shamefully. Other OT texts reflect on the shame the Chaldeans brought to conquered peoples (Isa. 54:4; Zeph. 3:19), while Jeremiah 51:7 describes this oppressive nation as a cup of drunkenness. Likewise in Judah the powerful were manipulating and controlling the experiences of others in order to exploit them in various ways.

The desire to shame others is the particular focus of this oracle. The irony is that those desiring to shame others will themselves be shamed. Whereas they had previously sought to shame others by exposing their nakedness, they themselves will now be shamed. The verb translated "show your uncircumcision" might also be translated "be reckoned as uncircumcised"; oppressors among the covenant community will be considered no longer a part of it. Yahweh, the one who holds the true cup of shame, will bring it upon them as an exact retribution for their crime. The image of Yahweh holding a cup of judgment is a common one (e.g., Ps. 75:8) and may reflect rituals performed in the temple, but the key point is that Yahweh exposes the actions of the oppressor for what they are.

<span id="page-550-2"></span>The prophet refers specifically to violence done to Lebanon as the type of violence that will overwhelm the oppressor, violence that saw murder and willful destruction of animals. The exact historical atrocity referenced here is unclear, and perhaps Habakkuk is drawing on the frequent boast of ancient Near Eastern kings of having plundered Lebanon. What is clear in any case is the wider pattern in which oppressors were attacking the weak (cf. the repetition of Hab. 2:8b in v. 17). As such, this is now one example among many of the plundering of nations, the perpetrators of which now stand under the Lord's judgment.

<span id="page-550-11"></span><span id="page-550-10"></span><span id="page-550-7"></span><span id="page-550-3"></span>2:18–20 The final woe oracle is distinct from the previous four in its emphasis on idolatry rather than oppression (although the two are often related). Moreover, the term "woe" is deferred until verse 19 instead of beginning the oracle. The OT is replete with denunciations of idolatry (e.g., Ps. 115:4–8; Isa. 40:18–20; 41:21–29;

<span id="page-551-0"></span>44:9–20), representing a major break with the dominant ancient Near Eastern culture. As is common in the OT, Habakkuk notes that idols are human creations that offer no profit. Habakkuk develops a paradox: although an idol is silent, it nevertheless is able to deceive those who trust it. Thus those trusting idols stand under divine judgment, for telling a piece of wood or stone to awaken or arise is foolish, and no amount of gold or silver overlay will give it life. By contrast, Yahweh is real and is present in his temple, and all the earth is called to silence before him. In this way, Habakkuk brings the woe oracles to a close while also preparing for the psalm of chapter 3.

<span id="page-551-5"></span><span id="page-551-2"></span>Yahweh dwells in his temple, and from there he sees all; once this reality is recognized, one understands that the temple is also the divine palace, the place from which the true king dispenses justice. Idolatry attempts to avoid Yahweh's claims by denying the reality of his existence. Yet life must be lived under his rule, and the oppressors of chapter 2 have missed this fundamental fact. Further, Yahweh's rule from his temple grounds the claim of 2:3 in a fundamental reality. The reality of his rule over all the earth means those living by faith can be sure his justice will finally be seen, even if its exact timing is not disclosed.

### <span id="page-551-4"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-551-3"></span><span id="page-551-1"></span>Habakkuk's problem in 1:1–2:5 was that he could not see God's justice being worked out in the world around him. Violence was multiplied in Judah, and God's initial solution to that problem—the Chaldeans—seemed only worse. However, 2:2–5 suggested a fundamental attitude that could help the prophet in his perplexity. He needed to understand that Yahweh's purposes did not necessarily proceed at the same pace as did those of the prophet, nor of any other human. With this realization, faith was necessary to appreciate that Yahweh would indeed act justly; oppression would be addressed.

The five woes in this passage then begin to resolve these concerns in light of the posture established by 2:2–5. How does God act justly? Will he do so within history, or only at the end? The woes insist that justice will be done, but it may be done either within history or eschatologically. The oppressors, whether they be the Chaldeans, the violent within Judah, or any others since then, stand under God's judgment.

The first two woe oracles suggest that judgment on the oppressors may come from their own actions—their oppressive violence sows the seeds of their own destruction. Sometimes no direct action from God is required as such violence eventually undoes itself. The last three woe oracles, however, explicitly mention Yahweh's involvement. There are times when God intervenes and overthrows the violent with justice measured exactly to the crime. It is difficult for those who witness such judgment to know if God's justice comes about from direct intervention or because of the way violence inherently destroys itself. Nevertheless, in whichever way justice is served, it is God who has brought it about, for he sovereignly controls even things that happen "naturally." Justice will be done.

<span id="page-552-1"></span><span id="page-552-0"></span>This reality is grounded ultimately in the character of Yahweh as the one who is supreme over all, before whom all other "gods" are shown to be petty nothings. As Yahweh is enthroned in his temple and all are to be silent before him, we can live by faith, trusting that in God's time we will see justice done when Babylon the great has finally fallen (Revelation 18).

## HABAKKUK 3:1–19

3 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.

**<sup>2</sup>** O Lord, I have heard the report of you, and your work, O Lord, do I fear. In the midst of the years revive it; in the midst of the years make it known;

 in wrath remember mercy. **<sup>3</sup>** God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. *Selah* His splendor covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

- **<sup>4</sup>** His brightness was like the light; rays flashed from his hand; and there he veiled his power.
- **<sup>5</sup>** Before him went pestilence, and plague followed at his heels.*<sup>1</sup>*
- **<sup>6</sup>** He stood and measured the earth; he looked and shook the nations; then the eternal mountains were scattered; the everlasting hills sank low. His were the everlasting ways.
- **<sup>7</sup>** I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
- **<sup>8</sup>** Was your wrath against the rivers, O Lord? Was your anger against the rivers, or your indignation against the sea, when you rode on your horses, on your chariot of salvation?
- **<sup>9</sup>** You stripped the sheath from your bow, calling for many arrows.*<sup>2</sup> Selah* You split the earth with rivers.
- **<sup>10</sup>** The mountains saw you and writhed; the raging waters swept on; the deep gave forth its voice; it lifted its hands on high.
- **<sup>11</sup>** The sun and moon stood still in their place at the light of your arrows as they sped, at the flash of your glittering spear.
- 
- **<sup>12</sup>** You marched through the earth in fury; you threshed the nations in anger.
- **<sup>13</sup>** You went out for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of your anointed. You crushed the head of the house of the wicked, laying him bare from thigh to neck.*<sup>3</sup> Selah*
- **<sup>14</sup>** You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors, who came like a whirlwind to scatter me, rejoicing as if to devour the poor in secret.
- **<sup>15</sup>** You trampled the sea with your horses, the surging of mighty waters.
- **<sup>16</sup>** I hear, and my body trembles; my lips quiver at the sound; rottenness enters into my bones; my legs tremble beneath me. Yet I will quietly wait for the day of trouble to come upon people who invade us.
- **<sup>17</sup>** Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls,
- **<sup>18</sup>** yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will take joy in the God of my salvation.
- **<sup>19</sup>** God, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the deer's; he makes me tread on my high places.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-553-4"></span><span id="page-553-3"></span><span id="page-553-2"></span><span id="page-553-1"></span><span id="page-553-0"></span>Chapter 3 is clearly distinct from the two previous chapters of Habakkuk, yet it is also the logical conclusion to the book. Like many of the psalms, it has a superscription, describing it as a "prayer of Habakkuk," as several psalms are similarly headed (Psalms 17; 86; 90; 102; 142). Habakkuk's prayer is "according to Shigionoth," a plural form of a term also appearing in the superscription to Psalm 7. Its meaning is unknown, although it could refer to a tune used in worship. The use of "*Selah*" (Hab. 3:3, 9, 13) is also typical of psalms, although its meaning also is unknown. Also typical of psalms is the note "to the choirmaster" (v. 19), which occurs in the superscription of fifty-five psalms; here, unusually, it occurs as a closing note. Habakkuk's prayer frequently alludes to various psalms and is either composed in archaic poetry or drawn in part from existing poems reflecting such psalms, suggesting that Habakkuk's prayer is shaped by reflection on the Psalter.

<span id="page-554-1"></span><span id="page-554-0"></span>Despite this chapter's distinct character within the book of Habakkuk, it is clearly a logical conclusion to the book as a whole, developing earlier themes. In 1:1–2:5 Habakkuk complained about the violence within Judah and then about Yahweh's response in sending the Chaldeans. That passage climaxed with the assertion that the righteous must live by faith, trusting Yahweh to do ultimately what is just. Then followed the five woes outlined in 2:6–20, which declared the downfall of the wicked and violent, both because their violence contained the seeds of their own destruction and because of Yahweh's direct action. These woes climaxed in the declaration of Yahweh's presence in the temple but did not give a timetable for when the wicked would be overthrown. These first two sections of the book have thus stressed the importance of living by faith, a key part of which is acknowledging that Yahweh's justice will ultimately be seen.

<span id="page-554-2"></span>But what does that mean for those who live in a world marked by violence and injustice? This issue is addressed in the prayer of chapter 3. Very little of the prayer can be called intercession, with the only petitions occurring in verse 2. Rather, it is a speech addressed to God in which the prophet reflects on God's actions on behalf of his people and realizes that the posture of faith involves continuing to trust, indeed to rejoice, in God as the one who comes to deliver his people. Habakkuk has not yet seen a change in his position—indeed, he understands it may well get worse before it gets better—but he knows from Israel's tradition and worship that God's justice will ultimately be experienced. This is what he finally understands in this prayer, a prayer that in turn is presented as a challenge to those who read to appreciate its reality for them as well.

### *Comment*

3:1 This verse follows the typical pattern for the heading of a psalm, but with some distinctive features. As noted above, it contains words typical of such superscriptions, and the use of the preposition "of" (*le*) before Habakkuk's name is also consistent with such titles. Grammatically, the preposition does not necessarily designate authorship, although at the least it indicates that a given text is in some way associated with the named figure—it could serve as a dedication, for example. Given the close links between this chapter and the first two, however, it seems best to understand the preposition as denoting authorship. The presence of a title also suggests this prayer was kept in some collection outside the present book of Habakkuk, most probably a collection of the temple choirmaster (v. 19b). The superscription thus points readers to an alternative location for this text, indicating it can profitably be studied in its own right, but its placement here requires us to reflect on it primarily in its current context.

<span id="page-555-2"></span><span id="page-555-1"></span><span id="page-555-0"></span>An analogy might be drawn with David's song in 2 Samuel 22, which also serves as Psalm 18. That song has a particular function in 2 Samuel, where, along with David's last words (2 Sam. 23:1–7), it provides a poetic reflection on the whole of his reign. However, it also functions as a psalm that can be studied on its own or within its particular context in the Psalter. As liturgical texts, both David's song and Habakkuk's prayer can be understood against their particular historical moment or more broadly by worshipers coming from diverse backgrounds who need only limited guidance as to the text's origin. We no longer possess the other collection into which Habakkuk's prayer may have been placed, but the presence of the title here points to this wider possibility of usage. It is possible the prayer specifically intends to evoke some of these associations with Psalm 18, one of the psalms to which it alludes at numerous points.

<span id="page-555-4"></span><span id="page-555-3"></span>This superscription is also distinctive in its reference to "Habakkuk the prophet." In the Psalter the titles merely refer to a personal name, with three exceptions. In Psalms 18 and 36 David is referred to as "the servant of the Lord," while in Psalm 90 Moses is referred to as "the man of God." Notably, all three of these psalms bear connections with Habakkuk's prayer. We are thus compelled to read this prayer through the prism of these (and other) psalms. Yet within Habakkuk it is not strictly necessary to call him "the prophet," since he has already been given that title (Hab. 1:1). By retaining the title, readers are reminded that even though the words of this chapter are a prayer to God, they are also a word from God to us.

<span id="page-555-6"></span><span id="page-555-5"></span>3:2 As is typical of many prayers in Scripture, Habakkuk begins by directly addressing Yahweh, affirming the Lord's past actions. In the context of this book, such affirmation is particularly poignant because it is the absence of Yahweh's great acts that has troubled the prophet. Habakkuk affirms that he has "heard the report" of Yahweh—he has heard of the Lord's great deeds. In addition, Habakkuk "fear[s]" the Lord's "work"—he is in awe of how the Lord has acted. In light of this acknowledgement, Habakkuk asks Yahweh to revive "it," probably a reference to the work just referenced, and to "make it known." The implication is that both those who have suffered under injustice and those who have practiced it might come to know Yahweh's work—although each would experience this knowledge rather differently.

These appeals are then concluded by the one element that does not stand in a pair and so receives emphasis by both its placement at the end of the verse and its grammatical distinctiveness: "in wrath," Yahweh is asked to "remember mercy." The word used for "wrath" here is unusual (occurring only seven times in the OT) and might also be translated "agitation." Although Habakkuk longs to see Yahweh active once again, he knows from his experience that this excludes neither pain for those who are faithful to him nor judgment for those who are not. So, in the "agitation" that comes from the revival of Yahweh's work, Habakkuk knows that mercy is needed.

<span id="page-556-7"></span><span id="page-556-4"></span><span id="page-556-2"></span>3:3–7 The prayer now describes a theophany, an appearance of God to his people. Several such descriptions appear in the OT, and they all narrate God's movement through the land from south to north (as in Psalm 68). Although these theophanies typically describe events in the past (e.g., Deut. 33:2), the opening verbs used here are in the imperfect tense, indicating that this theophany either is already occurring or is imminent as Habakkuk speaks. Only the powerful coming of God, as he has come in the past, will bring justice for his people. God's initial coming is from Teman, a word that also means "south," and from Mount Paran, a location to the northeast of Mount Sinai that was an initial stopping point for Israel after they left Sinai in the exodus (Num. 10:12). Just as God, the Holy One, had powerfully been with Israel in their journey through that region in the exodus, so now again he similarly comes to his people.

<span id="page-556-6"></span><span id="page-556-5"></span><span id="page-556-1"></span><span id="page-556-0"></span>The "*Selah*" at the end of the first line of verse 3 perhaps indicates a slight pause in the liturgy of the prayer, and it also enables a shift to perfect verbs that then describe God's coming. Verse 3b thus focuses on God's splendor covering the heavens and his praise filling the earth. As in Genesis 1:1, the pairing of "heavens" and "earth" refers to the whole of creation—no part of it is separated from God's glory. This picture of divine splendor is then developed in Habakkuk 3:4, which describes manifestations of this splendor as brightness flashing from God's hand like light, even as his power is veiled. This description is similar to Psalm 18:12, another text describing a theophany.

<span id="page-556-9"></span><span id="page-556-8"></span><span id="page-556-3"></span>The demonstration of God's power is then the focus of Habakkuk 3:5–7. Both "plague" and "pestilence" travel with God as personified members of his retinue, one preceding him and the other following. Nothing can resist him any more than Pharaoh and his forces could resist the plagues and pestilence preceding the exodus. Indeed, the whole earth trembled before God's power. This shaking allows the mountains to be removed and the hills to sink, clearing the path for God's journey. The hills were as old as creation, but it is God's ways that are truly eternal. So also the nations that stood in the way of God's journey tremble. "Cushan" is not mentioned elsewhere in the OT (unless it is a variant for Cush), but "Midian" refers to a people who lived in the Arabian Peninsula, the region of the exodus; we are probably to locate Cushan in the same area. God is coming, and everything else is shown to be powerless in comparison.

<span id="page-556-10"></span>3:8–15 Whereas the exodus has been the dominant point of reference thus far in describing God's coming, from this point on the conquest is in view as well. These themes obviously belong together and cannot be entirely separated here, but the conquest reflects the point where God moved from the Sinai Peninsula to enter

the land. Moreover, it emphasizes that he comes to claim victory. Since Habakkuk's concern is with life in the land, particularly injustice experienced within it, his prayer focuses on God's power as shown there. God's coming in power is not restricted to remote places known from the past but encompasses the land where his people now live.

<span id="page-557-6"></span><span id="page-557-5"></span><span id="page-557-4"></span>At the same time, the demythologizing evident in verses 5–7 continues here, since both sea and rivers appear in Canaanite mythology: Yahweh, complete with chariot and horses, arrows and spear, comes and overcomes all. Whereas in verses 3–7 Yahweh is merely spoken about, here he is addressed directly in his wrath. None of the three terms for wrath here ("wrath," "anger," "indignation") is the same as that used in verse 2, but the parallelism indicates they are broadly synonymous. The rivers receiving his wrath are not named, but could be both the Nile and the Jordan, the rivers that marked the beginning and end of the exodus. Yahweh's anger was directed not against the waters themselves but against those who had acted unjustly against Israel. The implication is therefore that his anger will be directed against those who act unjustly now, both the rapacious Chaldeans and those within Israel who enact violence. The God who rides his war chariot with his bow and arrows, who acts against the oppressor, is the one who comes to his people.

<span id="page-557-7"></span><span id="page-557-3"></span><span id="page-557-2"></span><span id="page-557-0"></span>Again, "*Selah*" in verse 9 suggests a brief pause, with verses 9b–11 then describing the ways in which Yahweh's power is seen in the earth. References to "split[ting] the earth with rivers" and mountains that "writhed" might point to seismic events, although it is more likely that the raging waters are those filling a wadi after heavy rain. However we understand the created order, all of it stands under Yahweh's authority; all is in awe of him (cf. Ps. 77:11–19). Because of this, Yahweh can act for his people within creation, as evidenced by his control of sun and moon, alluding to the events of Joshua 10. That great victory included a hailstorm (Josh. 10:11), and thus it is likely that the description of Yahweh's "arrows" and "spear" also refers to aspects of that storm, such as hail and lightning. As the balance of Joshua 10–11 describes victories won over nations already in the land, it is probable that we should understand Habakkuk 3:12–13 as referring primarily to Yahweh's march through the land, which again provides evidence of his ability to work for his people there. The last part of verse 13 is obscure, but would again seem to point to victories Yahweh has won over Israel's enemies.

<span id="page-557-10"></span><span id="page-557-9"></span><span id="page-557-8"></span><span id="page-557-1"></span>The function of "*Selah*" at the end of verse 13 is also unclear, but it could provide a pause to reflect on various victories won by Yahweh. However, verses 14–15 also develop the theme of these victories, even if the sense of verse 14 is particularly difficult to ascertain and all translations are to some extent a guess. It appears that the enemy soldiers are defeated with their own weapons, even though they had come in great power and in anticipation of an easy victory. Instead of such a victory, Yahweh slew them with their own weapons, showing himself to be greater than all his foes. Although no other text speaks of Yahweh's trampling the sea, this is probably a further reference to the exodus, the greatest OT example of the Lord defeating his people's foes.

<span id="page-558-7"></span><span id="page-558-6"></span><span id="page-558-3"></span>3:16–19a In verse 14 we began to see something of Habakkuk's own experience as he spoke of the enemy coming "to scatter me." At that point the prophet stood as the representative of the whole people, and the enemy's attack on him was an attack on all. Here in verse 16 we see a new focus on the prophet as the one who provides a model for all to follow. There is a close link between this passage and verse 2, as both begin with the same verb. But whereas there Habakkuk referred to what he had heard of the past, he is now in the position of hearing God's coming in the present, whether in a vision or metaphorically. The one who comes from Teman (v. 3) is heard by the prophet. Just as the tents of Midian had trembled at Yahweh's coming (v. 7), so also Habakkuk's body trembles. The word translated "body" might also refer to the internal organs, so he is perhaps contrasting the inner and the outer body (represented by the quivering lips), a pattern that would then be repeated by the reference to the bones and legs.

<span id="page-558-5"></span><span id="page-558-4"></span><span id="page-558-2"></span>However Habakkuk's body is considered, it is like the rest of creation and cannot help but be overcome by Yahweh's awesome coming. Yet, even though he struggles, the knowledge of Yahweh's coming allows Habakkuk to wait with quiet confidence for Yahweh to act against those invading the nation. Judah's distress has been brought about because of its own violence (1:3–4), but the prophet knows from both the exodus and the conquest that there will also be a day of reckoning for those who now oppress God's people. Both those oppressing from within and those oppressing from without will be thwarted, and although they seem to be all-powerful, Habakkuk knows that they too will come to a day of trouble.

<span id="page-558-8"></span><span id="page-558-0"></span>But what would it mean to "quietly wait"? Habakkuk answers in 3:17–19 in a way that would be considered counterintuitive to a person of faith. Although passages like Deuteronomy 28 indicate that agricultural abundance is what a faithful nation should expect, Habakkuk knows the present situation is more complex. Judah has not been faithful and thus cannot expect to see abundance in crops or herds. But Habakkuk knows Yahweh is coming and will act against the oppressors. A period of struggle must happen, but it will not be the end. Thus Habakkuk can rejoice in Yahweh, finding joy in the God of his salvation. Although no timetable has been given, Habakkuk knows Yahweh is coming, and the prophet will exult in Yahweh's victory. Until then, it is Yahweh who is Habakkuk's strength, who lets him walk on high places with the certainty of a deer (cf. Ps. 18:33). It is this confidence that makes Habakkuk a model for all in Judah.

<span id="page-558-9"></span><span id="page-558-1"></span>3:19b As noted above, the closing note is modeled on the superscriptions of numerous psalms. Here it has been moved to the end of the prayer as a final reminder of its liturgical significance. This is Habakkuk's prayer, but it is a prayer that could continue to be prayed along with the psalms in the temple and which should be prayed today, reminding each generation of the God who comes and brings victory and who gives hope in uncertainty.

### *Response*

Habakkuk's prayer is a powerful meditation on God's coming to his people to provide hope amid circumstances that might otherwise seem hopeless. As a meditation, his prayer involves significant reflection on Scripture, only some of which has been noted here. As a prayer it is addressed to God, but as Scripture it is also God's Word to us. Habakkuk not only models prayer in challenging circumstances; he also models the sort of trust the people of God ought to have when suffering the challenges of injustice. At its heart, this prayer knows that when God comes he will indeed overcome all his enemies, but it also knows that the identity of the enemy is complex. Throughout the book, Habakkuk has wrestled with troubles from two directions. On the one hand is injustice within Judah that paralyzes the law and promotes violence. This is precisely the sort of thing God has promised to judge. But Habakkuk also knows that the Chaldeans, whom God is raising up to discipline Judah, are themselves rapacious and violent. How, then, can Habakkuk hold to the justice of God if his punishment seems worse than the crime?

It is through this prayer that Habakkuk models full reliance on God's justice. It is important that such reliance be modeled rather than simply stated, for such issues are too often reduced to simple slogans. Yes, Habakkuk knows he needs to trust God, but he needs to trust him in a world where God's judgment must address both Judah and the Chaldeans, while prevailing for those who are truly his people. This is a prayer for when there are no easy solutions, when ethical issues are complex. Yet it finds resolution in the fact that Yahweh is a God of justice, and as such he can also be the God of Habakkuk's salvation. When God comes, he comes in power, and his power is expressed justly. This does not mean an easy resolution to the challenges Habakkuk faces. But he knows that the God who comes is the one enabling him to endure those challenges. God comes in power and justice, and knowing this gives Habakkuk the resources to live in faith, trusting God until that justice is experienced.

<span id="page-559-3"></span><span id="page-559-2"></span><span id="page-559-1"></span><span id="page-559-0"></span>"God with us" is a theme running through the whole of Scripture. God comes, and has come, to us in the person of Jesus, and in him we have salvation. But Jesus will come again, and when he does he will come in power (Rev. 19:11–16), bringing the renewal of creation to an everlasting era in which there will be neither pain nor injustice (Rev. 21:1–4). Until then, we live in a world marked by pain, suffering, and injustice, but we trust in the God who comes and who will ultimately bring justice. Like Habakkuk, in this context we live rejoicing in the God of our salvation, knowing his power that enables us to continue while waiting for the fullness of that coming. We are encouraged in this through Jesus' continued ministry for us, for as our Great High Priest he understands our weaknesses (Heb. 4:15) and lives to intercede for us (Heb. 7:25; cf. Rom. 8:34). Therefore, amid this struggle we know that we are kept by Jesus.

# ZEPHANIAH

*Jason S. DeRouchie*

## INTRODUCTION TO ZEPHANIAH

## *Overview*

<span id="page-563-4"></span>The book of Zephaniah is the Savior's summons to satisfaction. Following the superscription (1:1), the prophet provides a setting for the summons by portraying the nearness and nature of the Lord's punishment on Judah and the world (1:2–18). He then unpacks the substance of the summons itself, calling his listeners to seek the Lord together (2:1, 3) in order to avoid punishment (2:1–3:7), and then to wait on the Lord (3:8) in order to enjoy satisfying salvation (3:8–20).

## <span id="page-563-8"></span><span id="page-563-6"></span>*Author*

<span id="page-563-3"></span><span id="page-563-1"></span><span id="page-563-0"></span>The name Zephaniah means "Yahweh has hidden." That Zephaniah's parents used "Yahweh" as part of his name suggests they trusted in the Lord, which is especially significant in light of the fact that Zephaniah was likely born during the shadowy reign of Manasseh (2 Kings 20:21–21:18). From Zephaniah 1:1 we know that Zephaniah's great-great-grandfather was righteous King Hezekiah (2 Kings 18–20; Isaiah 36–39), making him a member of the royal family and therefore a reminder of the hope of the Davidic covenant even in an age of darkness. His social status may explain why he was aware of the international climate (Zeph. 2:4–15) and the ethics of Jerusalem's political and religious leadership (1:4, 8–9; 3:3–4). His likely biracial heritage (cf. 1:1) made him an especially appropriate spokesman for the Lord's promise of global restoration (3:9–10).

## <span id="page-563-10"></span><span id="page-563-7"></span><span id="page-563-5"></span>*Date and Occasion*

Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of King Josiah of Judah (640–609 BC) (1:1), just prior to Jerusalem's destruction by Babylon in 586 BC (1:4; 3:7). Because Zephaniah's message shows signs of Deuteronomy's influence while also stressing a high need for spiritual growth, he likely ministered early in 622 BC after Josiah found the Book of the Law but before the king's reform movement was fully underway (2 Kings 23:4–20; 2 Chron. 34:8–35:19).

## <span id="page-563-2"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-563-11"></span><span id="page-563-9"></span>At its heart, Zephaniah is "the word of the Lord" (1:1; cf. 3:20) cast as a prophetic oracle of exhortation (2:1, 3; 3:8a, 14) motivated by messages of warning (1:2–18; <span id="page-564-13"></span><span id="page-564-11"></span><span id="page-564-10"></span>2:4–3:7) and hope (3:8b–20). The book varies its addressees between the members of the remnant community (using masculine plural forms; e.g., 2:1, 3; 3:8, 14b, 20) and the collective city of Jerusalem (using feminine singular forms). When addressing Jerusalem, the book speaks to the city's corrupt and pre-punishment state on the one hand (3:7; cf. 3:1) and its purged, rescued, and transformed state on the other (3:11–12, 14–19). That Zephaniah uses second-person speech ("you/your") to address not only the "shameless nation" of Judah (2:1) but also foreign nations like Philistia (2:5) and Cush (2:12) highlights that his message of worldwide punishment and salvation (3:8–10) was ultimately for all who would hear and heed.

<span id="page-564-17"></span><span id="page-564-16"></span><span id="page-564-12"></span><span id="page-564-5"></span><span id="page-564-4"></span>Frequently within the book the identity of the speaker changes without any clear signal (e.g., the prophet refers to Yahweh in the third person in 1:7, but then Yahweh speaks in first person in v. 8). Nevertheless, the sermon still reads as a cohesive whole. The voices of Zephaniah and the Lord work together to proclaim a single "word" (1:1) *as if* a single voice were speaking.

### <span id="page-564-0"></span>*Theology of Zephaniah; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

THE SERIOUSNESS OF GOD'S WRATH AGAINST SIN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A SATISFYING SALVATION

<span id="page-564-8"></span><span id="page-564-6"></span><span id="page-564-3"></span>Throughout the Prophets, the phrase "day of the Lord" often refers to God's final and decisive move to execute justice and reestablish right order in the world. The phrase also points to any number of historical foretastes of this ultimate day, wherein the Lord punishes on a smaller scale in anticipation of the full onslaught of his wrath. Zephaniah strongly anticipates the "day of the Lord" (1:7, 14), which he characterizes as a time of both vengeance (1:15, 18; 2:2–3; 3:8) and hope (3:11, 16, 19–20). The book anticipates Babylon's impending desolation of Judah (1:4–13; 2:2; 3:7) while also envisioning God's destruction of all evil in the world (esp. 1:2–3, 14–18; 3:8). Yahweh's desire for the world to reflect the glory of his goodness, justice, mercy, and love leads to passionate zeal against sin and rebellion (1:17–18). His patience will not last forever, so people must respond now before his anger consumes his adversaries (2:2).

<span id="page-564-18"></span><span id="page-564-15"></span><span id="page-564-14"></span><span id="page-564-9"></span><span id="page-564-7"></span><span id="page-564-2"></span><span id="page-564-1"></span>Because Zephaniah is so certain that Yahweh's war against sin is near (1:7, 14), his book operates much like a basic-training manual, clarifying the fundamentals of the faith that will ready his faithful people to be delivered when the King and his armies arrive in fury. The humble and upright must now seek the Lord together and wait upon him (2:1, 3; 3:8), rejoicing today in the hope that Yahweh will indeed save and satisfy (3:14, 17; cf. Rom. 5:2). Patiently pursuing the Lord together will manifest itself today in fleeing idolatry and looking to the Lord in prayer and devotion (Zeph. 1:4–6), nurturing humility and loving others (2:3), heeding his voice and learning from his discipline, and trusting and drawing near to him (3:2). These are the basics of one's relationship with God. Finding refuge in the Lord today alone supplies assurance that God will protect us from his wrath tomorrow (2:3). Therefore, those in Judah and beyond must patiently trust together (2:1, 3; 3:8a) that the Lord will faithfully preserve and fully save (3:8b–20).

#### THE GLORIES OF CHRIST AND HIS CHURCH

<span id="page-565-15"></span><span id="page-565-14"></span>Peter declared that "*all* the prophets" foretold Christ's sufferings and subsequent glories, including the glories seen in and through the church (Acts 3:18, 24; 1 Pet. 1:10–11; cf. Luke 24:26–27, 45–47). Zephaniah never explicitly predicts the messianic deliverer, instead highlighting how far Judah's sin had distanced them from that hope. Nevertheless, when we read it in light of the rest of Scripture, we see Zephaniah anticipating the Messiah and his mission in at least two ways: (1) Zephaniah portrays the day of the Lord as God's sacrifice by which he satisfies his wrath and gains victory over evil. The biblical authors apply the images of both sacrifice and victory to Christ's first and second comings. (2) Zephaniah envisions the church age, wherein Christ's death initially fulfills Zephaniah's vision of Yahweh's day of wrath against sinners and inaugurates the multiethnic gathering of worshipers in the presence of the King.

<span id="page-565-10"></span><span id="page-565-9"></span><span id="page-565-7"></span>For Zephaniah, the day of the Lord is a time of war when Yahweh will pour out his wrath on the rebellious of the earth (Zeph. 1:15–17). It is a time when "the fire of his jealousy" will consume the ungodly (1:18; 3:8), whom the prophet portrays as a "sacrifice" ready to be consumed (1:7–8; cf. Jer. 46:10; Rev. 19:17–21). Right order exists only where God is exalted over all, and his just jealousy moves him to reestablish order by overcoming evil. He accomplishes this only by killing either the sinner or a substitute (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). By failing to "draw near" to the Lord (Zeph. 3:2), especially through his provision of a substitute sacrifice (cf. Lev. 9:1–10:3), those in Jerusalem and beyond were exposing themselves to *becoming* the sacrifice.

<span id="page-565-11"></span><span id="page-565-4"></span><span id="page-565-3"></span><span id="page-565-2"></span><span id="page-565-0"></span>Within the law, God had already identified the relationship of animal sacrifice to his war against sin. We see this, e.g., in the way the "pleasing aroma" of Noah's burnt offerings provides the context for the Lord's promise never again to destroy the earth by water (Gen. 8:20–22). The link is similarly apparent in the way God's holy fire consumes both burnt offering and Aaron's wicked sons within the same context (Lev. 9:24; 10:2). We see correspondences in the way the Lord employs the imagery of his "consuming fire" to warn Israel to fear him as he was preparing to destroy the wicked of Canaan, whom Israel resembled (Deut. 9:3, 6, 27; 10:12). We may expand this thought in two different but related directions:

<span id="page-565-13"></span><span id="page-565-12"></span><span id="page-565-8"></span><span id="page-565-6"></span><span id="page-565-5"></span><span id="page-565-1"></span>*1. Christ was the sacrificial object of God's wrath.* Aligning with the above passages and similar ones, the law sets forth a clear pattern of substitution (e.g., Ex. 12:12–14; Lev. 16:15–22, 33–34), and prophets like Isaiah show that this pattern was pointing to the sufferings of the royal servant (Isa. 52:13–53:12). Within the Minor Prophets, the Davidic royal deliverer (Hos. 3:5; Mic. 5:2–5; Zech. 6:12–13; 9:9–10) triumphs only through deep tribulation, for he cleanses "the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem . . . from sin and uncleanness" only after he has been "pierced" (Zech. 12:10; 13:1; cf. 3:8–9; 13:7). Thus Zephaniah's link between the day of the Lord and sacrifice falls within a salvation-historical and canonical context that points ahead to the sacrificial work of the Messiah, Jesus.

<span id="page-566-18"></span><span id="page-566-6"></span>Because "it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins" (Heb. 10:4), Christ the God-man would be "pierced for our transgressions" and "crushed for our iniquities" (Isa. 53:5). He would bear God's wrath against the "many," taking upon himself the curse of sin so that his righteousness could in turn be credited to them (Isa. 53:10–11; cf. Gal. 3:13–14). "For our sake [God] made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor. 5:21; cf. Rom. 5:18–19; Phil. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:24).

<span id="page-566-15"></span><span id="page-566-8"></span><span id="page-566-7"></span>Each of the Gospel writers highlights the darkness that accompanied Jesus' crucifixion (e.g., Luke 23:44), and Peter's citation of Joel 2:30–31 in Acts 2:19–20 suggests that Peter identified this darkness with what the prophets said would precede the day of the Lord. Jesus is "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), and thus we should understand that when Jesus bore God's wrath as the sacrificial substitute on behalf of the elect, he was partially fulfilling what Zephaniah said would happen at the day of the Lord.

<span id="page-566-14"></span><span id="page-566-11"></span><span id="page-566-9"></span>*2. Christ the warrior will unleash God's wrath against his enemies.* In one sense, Christ's first appearing initiates the day of the Lord; at the same time, if people do not find refuge in him, the great day of fiery punishment is still approaching (Zeph. 1:18; 3:8). "By fire will the Lord enter into judgment, and by his sword, with all flesh; and those slain by the Lord shall be many" (Isa. 66:16). In this sense, the day of the Lord is yet to come (2 Thess. 2:2–3). As Peter asserted,

<span id="page-566-17"></span>The heavens and the earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. . . . But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. (2 Pet. 3:7, 10)

<span id="page-566-19"></span><span id="page-566-16"></span><span id="page-566-13"></span><span id="page-566-12"></span><span id="page-566-10"></span><span id="page-566-5"></span><span id="page-566-4"></span><span id="page-566-3"></span><span id="page-566-2"></span><span id="page-566-1"></span><span id="page-566-0"></span>Significantly, just as the biblical authors see the coming Messiah as the one who represents the people *before God* through his death and resurrection, so too they view this same Davidic royal figure as representing God *before the people* in his victorious, peace-establishing reign. That is, Yahweh accomplishes both the deliverance and the destruction associated with the day of the Lord *through* his Messiah. This Davidic figure would be the dragon-slayer (Gen. 3:15) who would overcome all hostility toward God and reestablish peace on a global scale (cf. Rev. 19:11–21 with Rom. 16:20). He would "possess the gate of his enemies," and in him would "all the nations of the earth be blessed" (Gen. 22:17b–18). His hand would "be on the neck" of his enemies, and to him would "be the obedience of the peoples" (Gen. 49:8, 10). He would "crush the forehead" of all oppressors, dispossess them, and "exercise dominion" on a global scale (Num. 24:17–19; cf. Zeph. 3:15, 19). His kingdom would be worldwide and include both a reunified Israel and a remnant from the nations (Isa. 11:10; Jer. 30:9; Hos. 3:5; cf. Zeph. 3:10, 15). He would rule forever with justice and righteousness, and all would know peace (Isa. 9:7; 11:3–5; Jer. 23:5; Ezek. 37:24–25; Mic. 5:4–5; Zech. 9:10; cf. Zeph. 3:5).

<span id="page-567-10"></span><span id="page-567-8"></span><span id="page-567-7"></span>Another of the minor prophets noted that the day of the Lord's fiery judgment would be preceded by the coming of a new Elijah and accompanied by the return of Yahweh to his temple (Mal. 3:1–2; 4:1, 5–6). Matthew identified John the Baptist as this Elijah (Matt. 11:9–15), who both anticipated the outpouring of God's fiery fury to distinguish the righteous from the wicked and identified Jesus as the one through whom God would bring destruction (Matt. 3:11–12). With regard to the return of Yahweh, John the apostle recognized Jesus as God's tabernacling presence and temple (John 1:14; 2:21). Furthermore, in his discussion of the triumphal entry, John applied Zephaniah's portrait of King Yahweh's victory over evil to Jesus. While John partially cites Zechariah 9:9, he also alludes to Zephaniah 3:14–15 by calling Jesus "the King of Israel" whose coming victory means the "daughter of Zion" should "fear not" (John 12:13, 15; cf. comment on Zeph. 3:14–15). It is to Jesus that the multiethnic crowds cry, "Hosanna!" ("Please save!"; John 12:13), and it is by Jesus that "the ruler of this world" is, even now, "cast out" (John 12:31).

<span id="page-567-15"></span><span id="page-567-14"></span><span id="page-567-13"></span><span id="page-567-12"></span><span id="page-567-9"></span><span id="page-567-6"></span><span id="page-567-4"></span><span id="page-567-3"></span>The NT authors stress that it is *through* Jesus that God stands both present and able to deliver: "The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save" (Zeph. 3:17). Jesus is "God with us" (Matt. 1:23) who has now been given "all authority in heaven and on earth" (Matt. 28:18). Through Jesus' death and resurrection God has already "disarmed the rulers and authorities" (Col. 2:15) and has "put all things under [Christ's] feet" (Eph. 1:22). And when Christ returns, all of God's enemies "will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when [our Lord Jesus] comes on that day to be glorified in his saints" (2 Thess. 1:9–10). In that day Christ will be called "Faithful and True" and "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Rev. 19:11, 16). "In righteousness he judges and makes war. . . . From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty" (Rev. 19:11, 15). And all God's enemies will be like a sacrificial feast before the Lord (vv. 17–18).

<span id="page-567-18"></span><span id="page-567-17"></span><span id="page-567-16"></span>In one sense the day of the Lord that Zephaniah envisioned has already begun, but in another sense, it is still to be completed. At his first coming, Christ stood as the substitutionary *object* of God's wrath for the elect, and at his second appearing he will be the *instrument* through whom God will pour out vengeance on all evil on behalf of the elect.

<span id="page-567-11"></span><span id="page-567-5"></span><span id="page-567-2"></span><span id="page-567-1"></span><span id="page-567-0"></span>We must also note how Zephaniah envisioned a multiethnic community that would survive God's punishment and gather to worship the Savior King with offerings in the new Jerusalem (Zeph. 3:9–10, 14–15, 17–20). This future day of the Lord intruded into the present in the death of Christ, suggesting that his resurrection and the outpouring of his Spirit at Pentecost have already inaugurated Zephaniah's vision of the new creation (3:9–20). In Jerusalem, Jesus initiated a great second exodus in which many peoples would be saved (Luke 9:31; cf. Zeph. 3:10, 19–20). He died "for the nation [of Israel], and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad" (John 11:51–52; <span id="page-568-2"></span>cf. Isa. 49:5–6). The church today, made up of believing Jews and Gentiles in Christ, is fulfilling this vision.

<span id="page-568-16"></span><span id="page-568-11"></span><span id="page-568-5"></span><span id="page-568-3"></span>One way this is seen is in Luke's depiction of the early church's growth in the beginning of Acts. In the context of explaining a mission of making worshipers "to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8), Peter's Pentecost sermon in Acts 2:17–21 cites Joel 2:28–32, which depicts the day of the Lord and mentions calling on God's name in ways very similar to Zephaniah (Zeph. 1:15; 3:8–9). What is not found in Joel, however, but is present in Zephaniah 3:9–10 is the vision of transformed "speech" (LXX = "tongue") and united devotion, both of which Luke highlights in detailing the outpouring of "tongues" (Acts 2:4, 11) and the amazing kinship enjoyed by early believers (vv. 42–47). Significantly, Zephaniah 3:10 uses ancient Ethiopia/Cush as the sole example of global restoration, which explains the otherwise intrusive story of the Ethiopian eunuch's salvation in Acts 8:26–40. Luke appears to be highlighting the fact that Zephaniah's vision of restoration is beginning to be fulfilled.

<span id="page-568-23"></span><span id="page-568-22"></span><span id="page-568-21"></span><span id="page-568-18"></span><span id="page-568-17"></span><span id="page-568-12"></span>Moreover, in broader fulfillment of Zephaniah's restoration hope in 3:9–10, the NT is clear that Jesus' first coming marks the beginning of the end of the first creation and initiates the new creation, which corresponds to the new covenant (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Heb. 8:13). It also stresses that Jews and Gentiles in Christ together make up one people of God, the church (Gal. 3:8, 14, 29; Eph. 2:14–16). As a new covenant community, we have already gathered "to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" (Heb. 12:22; cf. Gal. 4:26). With this, we are already offering sacrifices of praise and good deeds (Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15–16) as we carry out our duties as priests in the service of God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5). Nevertheless, we still look ahead to the new heaven and earth, when "the holy city, new Jerusalem," will descend from heaven "as a bride adorned for her husband" (Rev. 21:2) and there will no longer be "anything accursed" (22:3).

#### <span id="page-568-25"></span><span id="page-568-24"></span><span id="page-568-20"></span><span id="page-568-19"></span>THE EXALTATION OF GOD

<span id="page-568-8"></span><span id="page-568-6"></span><span id="page-568-4"></span>A key purpose of the book of Zephaniah is to exalt Yahweh God as the sovereign judge and supreme savior who deserves everyone's reverence. The proper name "Yahweh/the Lord" is his most common designation in the book (34x), and to this is often added descriptives, all of which highlight God's supremacy: "the Lord their/your God" (2:7; 3:17), "the Lord God" (1:7) and "the Lord of hosts" (2:9–10). He is also called "the God of Israel" (2:9), "her [Jerusalem's] God" (3:2), "the King of Israel" (3:15), and "a mighty one" (3:17). The prophet describes God's character as "righteous" (3:5) and notes that his homage-demanding presence is "awesome" (2:11) and is "in your [Jerusalem's] midst" (3:15, 17).

<span id="page-568-15"></span><span id="page-568-14"></span><span id="page-568-13"></span><span id="page-568-10"></span><span id="page-568-9"></span><span id="page-568-7"></span><span id="page-568-1"></span><span id="page-568-0"></span>Yahweh's just "jealousy" for the honor of his own name kindles his sacrificial fires of punishment against the ungodly (1:18; 3:8; cf. Ex. 34:14). Because he has diminished "all the gods of the earth," every knee "shall bow" to him (Zeph. 2:11; cf. Isa. 45:23; Rom. 14:11; Phil. 2:10). In the end, he will celebrate his purified remnant of faithful ones (Zeph. 3:17), whom he is transforming into a people of joy (3:14) for *his* "praise" and *his* "renown" throughout the earth (cf. comment on 3:19–20).

## *Preaching from Zephaniah*

<span id="page-569-2"></span><span id="page-569-1"></span>This book of prophecy is an ideal choice for Christian preachers to memorize, recite, and preach from, start to finish, within the local church (cf. 2 Tim. 3:15–17; 4:2). Not only does it total only fifty-three verses, but also, perhaps better than any other Minor Prophet, it clearly delineates all three of the issues most commonly addressed by God's OT mouthpieces: *sin*, *punishment*, and *restoration*. Nearly all of prophetic theology is captured in some way within Zephaniah's three chapters. The book is a God-given means for magnifying the beauties of Christ and his gospel (Luke 24:27; John 5:46; Acts 3:18; 1 Pet. 1:10–12).

<span id="page-569-0"></span>While some have preached solidly on the whole book in a single sermon,1 it is also possible to preach the treasures of the book over the course of several sermons. Personally, I have preached through the book over fifteen weeks, but I have also worked through the whole in just five sermons:

- 1. The Savior's Serious Response to Sin (1:1–6)
- 2. The Savior's Demand to Revere Him (1:7–18)
- 3. Seeking Refuge in the Only Savior (2:1–3:7)
- 4. Waiting for and Savoring the Savior (3:8–10)
- 5. A Satisfying Salvation––True Motivation (3:11–20)

Note that each sermon title is tied to the book's overarching theme, "The Savior's summons to satisfaction." With this, every passage unit aligns with the key structural divisions I see within Zephaniah's flow of thought.

I. The *Superscription* of the Savior's Summons to Satisfaction (1:1)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-571-8"></span>1:1 Like many of the prophetic writings (e.g., Hos. 1:1; Hag. 1:1; Zech. 1:1), Zephaniah opens with a superscription that characterizes the book as "the word of the Lord"––a title that infuses the book's message with incomparable authority and requires any audience to hear and to heed. In this instance, God's mouthpiece is Zephaniah, a prophet known only from this book. He is designated "son of Cushi," a proper name related to the ethnic title "Cushite" and the place designation "Cush."2 Cush was the name of ancient Ethiopia (located in the area of modern Sudan), which was then the center of black Africa. We know that Judah made a number of political alliances with the nation of Cush prior to Zephaniah's ministry (Isa. 18:1–2; 20:5–6) and that Jerusalem's leadership had strong ties with Cushites (2 Sam. 18:21; Jer. 38:7; 39:16). The special attention Zephaniah gives the "Cushites" (Zeph. 2:12) and "Cush" (3:10) in his declarations of punishment and restoration only adds to the likelihood that Zephaniah was a biracial Jew (probably through Cushi's mother, Gedaliah's wife) and that his father's name introduces the book's motif of international reconciliation with God (cf. 2:9; 3:9–10).3

<span id="page-571-11"></span><span id="page-571-10"></span><span id="page-571-9"></span><span id="page-571-6"></span><span id="page-571-5"></span><span id="page-571-2"></span><span id="page-571-1"></span>Among the prophets, only Zephaniah lists a five-generation genealogy, drawing attention to the last member, Hezekiah, who is likely the godly reformer and thirteenth king of Judah, who reigned from 729 to 686 BC (cf. 2 Kings 18–20; Isaiah 36–39). This link suggests Zephaniah was of royal descent and clarifies his interest in the royal court (e.g., Zeph. 1:8; 3:3–4) and awareness of international affairs. It also puts his role as spiritual and social reformer in context and highlights how God has preserved a faithful remnant in the Davidic line, even amid an age of darkness. This same generational faith is accented in the inclusion of God's name in the personal names of Zephaniah ("Yah[weh] has hidden") and three of his forefathers: Gedaliah ("Yah[weh] is great"), Amariah ("Yah[weh] has spoken"), Hezekiah ("Yah[weh] has strengthened me"). This transgenerational loyalty to Yahweh kindles hope for the fulfillment of the Davidic promises (2 Sam. 7:12–16).

<span id="page-571-4"></span><span id="page-571-3"></span><span id="page-571-0"></span>Josiah, king of Judah, was Hezekiah's great-grandson who took the throne at age eight after the murder of his wicked father, Amon (642–640 BC), and whose three-decade reign (640–609 BC) was marked by religious reform (2 Kings 22:1–23:30; cf. 2 Chron. 34:3–35:19). His reign followed the tragic, death-filled, rebellious days of Kings Manasseh (696–642 BC) and Amon (cf. 2 Kings 21), and Zephaniah's preaching would have helped initiate or assist Josiah's call for a return to the Lord.

<span id="page-571-7"></span><sup>2</sup> Zephaniah's father may be identical to Jehudi's great-grandfather (Jer. 36:14), who served as a royal official during the reign of Jehoiakim (609–598 BC).

<sup>3</sup> Rather than simply meaning "Cushite," "Cushi" could endearingly mean something like "my black one" or "my portion of Cush." This name would express his parents' delight in his ethnic heritage.

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-572-2"></span><span id="page-572-1"></span>Before Zephaniah pleads for a unified, patient pursuit of the Lord as the means to the satisfied life (2:1, 3; 3:8, 14), he sets the stage for this entreaty by calling his audience to revere God in light of the nearness and nature of the Lord's impending punishment on Judah and the world (1:2–18). Only those who pause to take seriously how their sin has offended God's holiness can delight in salvation.

		- 1. Global Punishment against the Rebels of Humanity (1:2–3)
		- 2. Local Punishment against the Rebels of Judah and Jerusalem (1:4–6)

## *Comment*

<span id="page-573-18"></span>1:2–6 As a means of introducing the call that follows, to revere God (vv. 7–18), Zephaniah opens his oracle with the Lord's promise to bring devastating punishment on the world in general (vv. 2–3), and Judah and Jerusalem in particular (vv. 4–6), in light of rampant wickedness and idolatrous rebellion.

<span id="page-573-14"></span><span id="page-573-11"></span>1:2–3 Like the gathering of a grape or fig harvest, where the primary purpose is to reap good fruit but the secondary purpose is to remove bad and unproductive fruit (cf. Jer. 8:13), the Lord commits himself to "gather" (ESV = "sweep away") his earthly creatures for judicial assessment (Zeph. 1:2; cf. 3:8; Isa. 24:22; Mic. 4:11–12) and to "cut off mankind from the face of the earth" (Zeph. 1:3). The scope of his covenantal action includes "everything," which means "man . . . beast . . . the birds . . . and the fish." "From the face of the earth" likely recalls the flood judgment (Gen. 6:7), while the fact that the four objects of wrath are listed in reverse order from the sequence in which God created them (Gen. 1:20–28) suggests the impending doom will be a type of de-creation. The placement of mankind at the top of the list highlights humanity's representational headship over the rest of creation (cf. Gen. 1:26, 28; Ps. 8:6–8).

<span id="page-573-20"></span><span id="page-573-12"></span><span id="page-573-4"></span><span id="page-573-2"></span><span id="page-573-1"></span><span id="page-573-0"></span>The "rubble" (or "stumbling blocks"; cf. ESV mg.) likely refers to idols (cf. Ezek. 7:19–20; 14:3–4), which God collects along with the "wicked" who worship them (cf. Matt. 13:41). The language of "cutting off" joins the harvest imagery of Zephaniah 1:2–3 to signal the ultimate covenant curse of death (cf. Gen. 9:11; Ezek. 14:17). Its use here highlights that *all* mankind stands accountable to God, who operates as covenant Lord over all the world by virtue of being its Creator (Gen. 9:9–10; Isa. 24:5–6).

<span id="page-573-13"></span><span id="page-573-3"></span>1:4–6 Even God's special covenant people are not impervious to the global judgment God has promised. Just as his "gathering/sweeping" will give rise to his "cutting off" at the worldwide level (vv. 2–3), so too the "stretching out" of his disciplining hand against Judah will result in his "cutting off" even the rebels from among his own people (v. 4).

<span id="page-573-19"></span><span id="page-573-16"></span><span id="page-573-10"></span>1:4a God's "stretching out" his hand is a regular image of divine retribution (Isa. 5:25; Ezek. 14:13). Here God pledges to work against Judah in the same manner in which he will work against the foreign nations (Zeph. 2:13). Jerusalem was the political and religious center of Judah (cf. 1 Kings 11:13, 36), but now the Lord would judge this capital city because of Baal worship (Zeph. 1:4b).

<span id="page-573-17"></span><span id="page-573-15"></span><span id="page-573-9"></span><span id="page-573-8"></span><span id="page-573-7"></span><span id="page-573-6"></span><span id="page-573-5"></span>1:4b–6 Baal-Hadad was the false Canaanite storm and fertility deity who provided the most enduring threat to exclusive Yahweh worship in Israel, especially because the land of Israel was so dependent on rain (cf. 1 Kings 17–18). Trusting counterfeit gods like Baal for help was always evil in the Lord's sight (cf. Deut. 5:7; Judg. 2:11–15; 3:7); such folly brought destruction to the northern kingdom (2 Kings 17:16–18) and rendered Judah's destruction imminent (2 Kings 22:16–17; 23:26–27; 24:3–4). That paganism and apostasy continued in Zephaniah's day was

#### Z ephaniah 1:2–6 574

<span id="page-574-12"></span>deeply concerning, especially because it reached all the way to the religious and political leadership (Zeph. 1:4, 8–9; 3:3–4).

<span id="page-574-16"></span><span id="page-574-1"></span>Some may read 1:4b as pronouncing judgment on two groups (the remnant of Baal and the priestly class), but the Hebrew construction implies that the clergy were a subset of the "remnant of Baal," as were those mentioned with them in verses 5–6: "the remnant of Baal––*that is,* the name of the illegitimate priests along with the priests *and* those who bow down . . . *and* those who bow down and swear . . . *and* those who have turned back" (AT). Priests of the Lord were supposed to teach his law, guard knowledge, and preserve what was holy (Lev. 10:10–11), yet even they were corrupt (Zeph. 3:4). The "idolatrous priests" (1:4b) were most likely illegitimate, non-Levitical clergy who led in the worship of idols (1 Kings 12:31–32; 13:33–34) and whom Josiah would ultimately remove during his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:5; cf. Hos. 10:5). The fact that their "name" is "cut off" suggests complete annihilation and contrasts with the lasting "honor" (i.e., name) God would give his remnant at the restoration (Zeph. 3:19–20).

<span id="page-574-18"></span><span id="page-574-14"></span><span id="page-574-13"></span><span id="page-574-9"></span><span id="page-574-4"></span>Along with the religious leadership (1:4), the remnant of Baal included three other groups: those revering the stars as gods (i.e., creation worshipers; v. 5a), those paying lip service to Yahweh but retaining other higher authorities (i.e., hypocritical syncretists; v. 5b), and those going their own way and failing to pray for guidance and help (i.e., the self-ruled and self-dependent; v. 6). Josiah would work intently to eradicate all instruments and individuals associated with any of these practices (2 Kings 23:4–5, 10, 24).

<span id="page-574-17"></span><span id="page-574-8"></span><span id="page-574-2"></span><span id="page-574-0"></span>"The host of the heavens" almost always refers to stars, which God "allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven" (Deut. 4:19), along with the sun and moon, not as objects of worship but as instruments of divine providence (Gen. 1:14). They also pointed to the surety of God's kingdom promises (Gen. 15:5; Jer. 33:22). God had already reproved the northern kingdom for creation worship (2 Kings 17:16–18), and now he promises comparable punishment on the south for doing the same (cf. 2 Kings 21:3, 5; Jer. 19:13).

<span id="page-574-15"></span><span id="page-574-11"></span><span id="page-574-6"></span><span id="page-574-5"></span><span id="page-574-3"></span>Jerusalem's Baal worship also included syncretism, that is, combining devotion to Yahweh with worship of other gods (Zeph. 1:5b). The ESV reads "Milcom," the false god of the Ammonites, whose veneration was explicitly condemned (1 Kings 11:5, 33). The Hebrew could also be read as "their king," but this royal title still appears to be referring to a god, which in context is likely Baal (Zeph. 1:4; cf. ESV mg.). The idea is that the remnant of Baal made oaths *to* Yahweh but did so *by*  (i.e., under the highest authority of) *their king*, that is, by another god, invoking his power to serve as witness to the vow and to hold them accountable. This was directly against God's instructions, and Josiah's reform sought to put an end to it (2 Kings 23:4).

<span id="page-574-10"></span><span id="page-574-7"></span>To "turn back from following the Lord" always depicts covenant disloyalty (Pss. 44:18; 78:57; Isa. 59:13). The covenant rebellion manifested itself through failure to "seek" and "inquire"––verbs often used as virtual synonyms and associated with reliance on God through prayerful repentance, request for help, or worship (cf.

<span id="page-575-5"></span><span id="page-575-1"></span><span id="page-575-0"></span>Deut. 4:29; 2 Chron. 20:3–4; Ps. 105:3–4; Jer. 29:13). The terms can also refer to the pursuit of knowing God's will or word (1 Kings 22:5; Amos 8:12). According to Zephaniah, turning from Baal will show itself in a commitment to Yahweh's revealed will and a life characterized by prayer. These are fundamental to walking with God. In Zephaniah 2:3, the call to "seek the Lord" is explicated as a quest for "righteousness" and "humility" before God, which the prophet argues is the only potential means for avoiding divine judgment and which he later shows to be a necessary step in experiencing lasting joy (cf. 3:12, 14–15).

### <span id="page-575-6"></span>*Response*

TAKE SERIOUSLY THE WARNING OF GOD'S COMING JUDGMENT

It is often easy to think, "God's punishment will not reach me." Many thought this at the time of the flood, and Zephaniah faced the same attitude in his day. Yet sin is serious, and, like a deadly virus, it affects and infects everything it touches, creating shame, fear, and guilt. Because Yahweh's holiness demands that he confront all failure to acknowledge his supremacy, he will bring "everything" into judgment (v. 2) and punish all the wicked (vv. 3–4).

<span id="page-575-8"></span><span id="page-575-4"></span>When Christ returns, opportunity for repentance will be no more. In that day the wicked "will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matt. 25:46). Indeed, "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 13:41–42; cf. Isa. 30:33; 34:10; 66:24; Dan. 12:2). We must heed Zephaniah's warning of the impending divine wrath, for God's kind forbearance and patience, which are intended to generate repentance, will not last forever (Rom. 2:4).

## <span id="page-575-10"></span><span id="page-575-3"></span>FLEE PLURALISM AND FOLLOW THE LORD ON THE ONLY PATH THAT LEADS TO LIFE

The god Baal exemplifies all that is hostile to Yahweh. We turn from giving the Lord his due whenever we begin to look to something other than him as our ultimate provider, protector, and treasure. Idolatry creates competing sovereigns, saviors, and satisfactions, but from and through and to the Lord are all things (Rom. 11:36). Zephaniah points to the truth that we as humans quickly prize people or position, power or possessions more than God. How quickly the fear of others trumps our fear of the Lord. How quickly pluralism becomes the norm.

<span id="page-575-11"></span><span id="page-575-9"></span><span id="page-575-7"></span><span id="page-575-2"></span>Like a teacher of wisdom, Zephaniah depicts covenant unfaithfulness as going one's own way rather than following God (Zeph. 1:6; cf. Ps. 1:6; Prov. 15:9). Prayerlessness and self-rule are sure symptoms of waywardness. The self-sufficient are self-condemned. Apart from Jesus, we cannot seek or inquire of the Father (John 14:6), and only in the path of Christ will we find life (Matt. 7:13–14; cf. Matt. 6:24; John 3:36). All who minimize sin and fail to seek the Savior will reap destruction.

- <span id="page-577-5"></span><span id="page-577-4"></span>3. Another Reason to Revere God, Described Broadly with Respect to the Whole World (1:14–18)

## *Comment*

1:7–18 Like a herald readying an audience for an angry king's arrival, Zephaniah orders his audience to hush (v. 7a). He then provides the basis for his call to revere God. He details both the temporal nearness and the sacrificial nature of Yahweh's encroaching judgment against Judah (vv. 7b–13) and the whole world (vv. 14–18). From the perspective of content, therefore, the two major divisions of chapter 1 display an A-B-C-B'-A' pattern:

- <span id="page-577-2"></span><span id="page-577-1"></span>A – Global punishment (1:2–3)
	- B Local punishment on Judah and Jerusalem (1:4–6)
		- C Be silent! (1:7a)
	- B' Jerusalem's fall (1:7b–13)
- A' The world's destruction (1:14–18)

Zephaniah's encircling of Jerusalem with wrath highlights that she will not escape judgment.

<span id="page-577-0"></span>1:7a Zephaniah captures his audience's attention by calling them to "be silent." The Bible uses this charge to move potential worshipers of Yahweh to turn their attention reverently to the Great King (Hab. 2:20; Zech. 2:13).

<span id="page-578-22"></span><span id="page-578-14"></span>1:7b "For" marks the reason for such awe-filled stillness: to prepare for the arrival of the sovereign God on his judgment day (cf. Rev. 8:1). The prophets apply the "day of the Lord" title both to the ultimate future day when God will finally eradicate all evil from the world and to the periodic intrusions of Yahweh's punishment that anticipate it––against rebels from Israel (e.g., Joel 2:1–11) and the nations (e.g., Isaiah 13). Here God's just anger is directed toward Jerusalem (Zeph. 1:8–13) in anticipation of his wrath against the world (vv. 14–18).

Jer. 46:10; Rev. 19:17–19). God must appease his just wrath, whether on the sinner or on the substitute. When atonement is not secured through faith in the provided substitute (Lev. 17:11; Isa. 52:13–53:12; Heb. 9:22), the fires of wrath will ultimately consume the offenders themselves (Zeph. 1:18; 3:8). While the "guests" God has "consecrated" could be the people of Judah as God invites them to their own slaughter, it seems more likely that those invited are the invaders the Lord has already set apart to destroy Judah.4 Most immediately this would be the Babylonians (Jer. 34:21–22; Hab. 1:6), but ultimately it will include the remnant of the godly who will stand with the King, executing God's wrath on the nations of the world (Ps. 149:5–9; 1 Cor. 6:2; Rev. 2:26–27).

<span id="page-578-16"></span><span id="page-578-15"></span><span id="page-578-10"></span><span id="page-578-5"></span>1:8–11 The Lord's punishment would extend as far as Judah's debauchery and idolatry did––all the way to the city's political and religious leaders. Zephaniah focuses on the former group when he mentions the public leaders ("officials," whether governmental or military), the royal court ("the king's sons"), and all those influenced by alien, pagan values ("foreign attire"; v. 8). He targets the latter when he speaks of those who engage in what appears to be pagan superstitious activity associated with the temple doorway ("everyone who leaps over the threshold"; cf. 1 Sam. 5:3–5). These are the ones who "fill their master's house" (= "their Lord's [i.e., Yahweh's] temple"; cf. Zeph. 1:9 ESV mg.) with "violence and fraud" (v. 9).5 Political and religious leaders were the central instigators of Judah's covenant rebellion and ultimately caused its destruction (Zeph. 3:3–4; cf. Jer. 32:32; 34:18–19). Where selfishness, power, money, and pagan influence reign, oppression and deceit often prevail (cf. Isa. 1:23).

"Crying," "wailing," and "loud crashes" are all sounds of war and its accompanying deep pain and grief. The "Fish Gate" was the main entrance to Jerusalem from the north (2 Chron. 33:14; Neh. 12:38–39), and the "Second Quarter" was the city

<span id="page-578-4"></span><span id="page-578-0"></span><sup>4</sup> The Hebrew reads, "The Lord has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated his guests." The lack of the word "and" between the two clauses suggests the second is further describing the first in some way. This could mean the "guests" are themselves the sacrifice (option 1) or that the "guests" will devour the sacrifice (option 2). Elsewhere the biblical authors apply the term "consecrated" to both the sacrifice (Ex. 28:38; Jer. 12:3, ESV = "set them apart") and the agents of slaughter (Isa. 13:3; Jer. 22.7), but the term "guests" appears restricted either to the instruments that carry out God's punishment (Ezek. 23:23, ESV = "men of renown") or to those who feast on a sacrifice (e.g., 1 Sam. 9:13; 1 Kings 1:41).

<span id="page-579-3"></span>section north of the temple (2 Kings 22:14). Zephaniah probably mentions them, along with the "hills," to clarify the direction from which God would bring punishment. The location of the "Mortar" is not clear, but its association with "traders" and "silver" suggests the market district wherein "foreign" influence and "violence and fraud" commonly flourished (cf. Isa. 2:6; Hos. 12:7).

<span id="page-579-27"></span><span id="page-579-17"></span><span id="page-579-16"></span><span id="page-579-11"></span><span id="page-579-10"></span><span id="page-579-9"></span><span id="page-579-7"></span><span id="page-579-5"></span>1:12–13 Zephaniah now further discusses the devastating nature of God's judgment upon Jerusalem. The Lord's search of the city "with lamps" points to the thoroughness of the search (cf. Luke 15:8) and highlights that none will escape punishment (Isa. 24:17–18; Amos 5:18–20). It may also hint that the onslaught of wrath will come "like a thief in the night" (1 Thess. 5:2; Rev. 3:3; cf. Joel 2:9). The prophet characterizes these rebels as "complacent" by comparing them to wine left too long in a jar (Zeph. 1:12 ESV mg.; cf. Jer. 48:11–12). While recognizing the existence of Yahweh, they live as deists, believing God would never fulfill his promises of blessing or curse, "good" or "ill" (cf. Jer. 5:12; Amos 9:10; Mic. 3:11). Instead of leading to deeper humility and gratitude for mercy, God's delayed punishment had resulted in the people's failure to fear God's wrath or to desire his blessing. Yet such practical atheism is foolish (Ps. 14:1), for Yahweh's patience did not mean he would automatically clear the guilty (Ex. 34:6–7). Soon their end would come, as God would target all their false securities ("goods . . . houses . . . vineyards"; cf. Zeph. 1:11, 18; Deut. 28:30–31, 39; Amos 5:11; Mic. 6:15).

<span id="page-579-23"></span><span id="page-579-14"></span><span id="page-579-13"></span><span id="page-579-4"></span><span id="page-579-2"></span><span id="page-579-0"></span>1:14–18 With an echo of verse 7b, verse 14 opens a new unit that builds on the previous reason given for revering God in verses 7b–13. Here the nature of God's day of wrath is first characterized (vv. 14–16) and then developed (vv. 17–18) with respect to the whole world.

<span id="page-579-25"></span><span id="page-579-22"></span><span id="page-579-21"></span><span id="page-579-12"></span>1:14–16 In contrast to his wording in verse 7, Zephaniah now describes the coming day of wrath as "great." This addition may only mark a shift in scope (from local to global) or it may also identify a change in time, with verses 7–13 addressing immediate punishment on Jerusalem in 586 BC but verses 14–18 detailing the final judgment associated ultimately with the first and second comings of Christ (Mal. 4:5; Acts 2:20; Rev. 16:14).6 To speak of this latter day as "near and hastening fast" would be to see history with respect to eternity and God's timeline. Regardless, what is clear is that the imminent timing (Zeph. 1:14a), the torturous sound (v. 14b), and the sheer terror of the day (vv. 15–16) make an immediate response imperative (cf. Isa. 13:6).

<span id="page-579-24"></span><span id="page-579-20"></span><span id="page-579-19"></span><span id="page-579-15"></span><span id="page-579-6"></span><span id="page-579-1"></span>The "bitter" noise of the day may recall the cries and wails of Zephaniah 1:10, and it is likely that this connection led the ESV translators to treat the "mighty man" of verse 14 as a valiant soldier crying in defeat. Nevertheless, because 3:17 uses the same term ("mighty man/one") for Yahweh the warrior (cf. Deut. 10:17), it is possible that the last line of Zephaniah 1:14 refers to God's war cry (NIV = "the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry"; cf. Isa. 42:13). If so, then from the

<span id="page-579-26"></span><span id="page-579-18"></span><span id="page-579-8"></span><sup>6</sup> Cf. the "*great* tribulation" in Matthew 24:21; Revelation 2:22; 7:14.

perspective of the offending parties, this cry is "bitter" because it means the Lord's fury is against them.

<span id="page-580-11"></span><span id="page-580-3"></span><span id="page-580-2"></span>With great clarity, Zephaniah 1:15–16 details the horror of God's judgment. A summary statement characterizes the day as one of "wrath" (v. 18). What then follows are five pairs of features of the day. The terms "distress and anguish" echo curses promised to Israel (Deut. 28:53, 55, 57) but are now applied to the whole world (cf. Deut. 30:7). "Darkness . . . gloom . . . clouds . . . thick darkness" are all common cataclysmic images associated with the day of the Lord. They express God's fierce presence and a reversal of creation (from life to death, from light to darkness) for those he is punishing.7 "Trumpet blast and battle cry" are sounds of alarm that prepare people for war (Num. 10:9; Jer. 4:19). Often they are associated with God's temporal or future judgment (e.g., Joel 2:1; Zech. 9:14; Matt. 24:31) and are directly linked to the second appearing of Christ (1 Thess. 4:16). Even the most secure strongholds are unable to withstand the Lord's destructive power (cf. Zeph. 2:8, 15; 3:6).

<span id="page-580-17"></span><span id="page-580-15"></span><span id="page-580-13"></span><span id="page-580-12"></span><span id="page-580-9"></span><span id="page-580-1"></span><span id="page-580-0"></span>1:17–18 Zephaniah now develops the nature of the punishment by asserting Yahweh's action (v. 17a) and then explaining (v. 17b) and synthesizing (v. 18) its destructive effects. God promises to "bring distress on mankind" (v. 17a); while he will use human and natural agents, he is always the decisive mover in punishment. Zephaniah initially highlights the effects in two ways (v. 17b). First, humanity's sin against the Lord will result in blindness––a covenant curse (Deut. 28:28–29) that likely points to a spiritual inability to see God's beauty and one's own neediness. Second, the pouring out of the victims' "blood" and "flesh" like "dust" and "dung" mixes images of sacrifice and war—sacrifice in the sense that the worthless and repulsive parts of the victims are emptied out in the process of slaughter, and war in the sense that the victims are dismembered, with small fragments scattered over the landscape (cf. Jer. 16:4 and Mal. 2:3, though both with different terms for "dung").

<span id="page-580-14"></span><span id="page-580-10"></span><span id="page-580-8"></span><span id="page-580-7"></span>Zephaniah 1:18 synthesizes the destructive effects of the Lord's deeds of wrath, first negatively and then positively. First, God's punishment will result in an impossibility of deliverance. Whether "silver" and "gold" refer to money (v. 11; Ezek. 7:19) or to the idols shaped from them (Zeph. 1:3, 5; 2:11; Isa. 45:20–21), no form of earthly or spiritual power can rescue the rebel from God's wrath (cf. 1 Sam. 12:20–21). Such salvation comes "not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ" (1 Pet. 1:18–19).

<span id="page-580-19"></span><span id="page-580-4"></span>Second, drawing again on the imagery of sacrifice, the Lord's punishment means complete destruction for every earthly rebel, all because "the fire of [God's]

<span id="page-580-18"></span><span id="page-580-16"></span><span id="page-580-6"></span><span id="page-580-5"></span><sup>7</sup> The OT uses the imagery of darkness to describe both the temporary, small-scale intrusions of the day of the Lord and the more ultimate future day against both Israel (Isa. 5:30; 8:22; Joel 2:2, 30–31; Amos 5:18, 20; 8:9) and the nations (Isa. 13:10; Ezek. 30:3; Joel 3:15). The NT applies the same foreboding descriptions to the outpouring of God's wrath with respect to both Jesus' death on the cross and the final judgment (Matt. 24:29; Acts 2:20; Rev. 6:12; 8:12). Darkness is a common physical phenomenon associated with war and death, so it is difficult to know if the biblical authors envisioned actual atmospheric changes or were simply depicting the personal distress of the objects of God's wrath, for whom life was coming to an end.

<span id="page-581-10"></span><span id="page-581-1"></span><span id="page-581-0"></span>jealousy" was aroused (Zeph. 1:18; 3:8). Scripture often associates Yahweh's jealousy with his blazing desire to be worshiped as the only God (e.g., Deut. 4:23–24; Ps. 79:5; Ezek. 23:25). Like a just judge committed to what is right, Yahweh's consuming passion for the honor of his name will soon burst forth in unquenchable fires of wrath against the ungodly of the earth (Isa. 66:15–16; Mal. 4:1; 2 Thess. 1:7–8), paralleling the earlier judgment by water (2 Pet. 3:5–7).

<span id="page-581-9"></span><span id="page-581-8"></span><span id="page-581-7"></span><span id="page-581-5"></span>Zephaniah 1 portrays a God who demands reverence (v. 7), whose just jealousy can be kindled into flames of wrath (v. 18), who works to appease all affronts to his holiness (vv. 7, 12–13), whose justice shows no prejudice (vv. 8–9), and whose punishment is both terrible and complete (vv. 11, 15–18). The words Zephaniah uses to describe the outbreak of divine anger are breathtaking (v. 15). Could the situation be more ominous? The tragedy of the 586 BC destruction of Jerusalem (cf. Lamentations) was but a foretaste of a climactic retribution still to come, which Christ will bring

in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might. (2 Thess. 1:8–9; cf. 2 Pet. 3:10)

<span id="page-581-14"></span>How dreadful to have the source of all power and the upholder of all life working against you. Having learned that the living God is approaching in anger, we must reverently quiet our speech, hearts, and activity before the Sovereign One, and, like Zephaniah, call others to do the same (Zeph. 1:7).

Introduction: Theology of Zephaniah; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ). The offering of animals prescribed in Leviticus was a means by which the heavenly warrior engaged in a conquest against evil to reestablish peace, punishing a substitute rather than a sinner. Similarly, at the cross, God's war against evil manifested itself in his cursing Christ on behalf of the elect (Isa. 53:11; Gal. 3:13). "He was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace" (Isa. 53:5; cf. Rom. 4:25; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 2:24). And, by his substitutionary act of love, Christ secured our right standing with God (Rom. 5:1, 18–19), having canceled "the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands" (Col. 2:14). Now, we need not fear the future day of the Lord's wrath (Rom. 5:9–11).

Yet Scripture is clear that, while there is "no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1) and all who have "been justified by his blood" will be "saved by him from the wrath of God" (Rom. 5:9), this very wrath "remains" on everyone who fails to surrender to Jesus (John 3:36). For these, the future day of the Lord is still ominous, for God will at that time destroy his enemies (Isa. 66:15–16; 2 Thess. 1:8–9; Heb. 10:27; 2 Pet. 3:7). As such, before "the day of vengeance of our God" (Isa. 61:2), the church must proclaim to a needy world the terms of peace and the good news that reconciliation with God is possible through faith in Christ (Rom. 1:16–17; 10:15; 2 Cor. 5:18–20). We must join Zephaniah in calling others to "be silent before the Lord God" (Zeph. 1:7)––to take sin seriously and to revere the One who will come in blazing wrath against his enemies. "Our Savior Christ Jesus . . . abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel" (2 Tim. 1:10). He is "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). This is the good news we must proclaim.

<span id="page-582-8"></span><span id="page-582-5"></span><span id="page-582-3"></span>The book's main section unpacks the substance of the Savior's summons to satisfaction. It uses six imperatives to charge the righteous remnant to pursue God patiently together, both to avoid judgment and to enjoy satisfaction (2:1–3:20). The main commands are found in two places: 2:1, 3 ("*Gather* together, yes *gather* . . . *Seek* the Lord . . . *seek* righteousness; *seek* humility") and 3:8a ("Therefore *wait* for me"). This multifaceted command is motivated by the impending curse God will bring on the rebels of the world (2:4–3:7) and by the blessing of joy in God and God's joy in his remnant who persevere through judgment (3:8b–20).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-585-2"></span><span id="page-585-0"></span>Zephaniah opens the book's main body with the first of two stages of the Savior's summons to satisfaction (2:1–3:7). With five imperatives (2:1, 3) the prophet charges those identifying with the righteous remnant of Judah to pursue the Lord together ("gather . . . seek") in order to avoid the coming wrath. The commands themselves are initially grounded ("For"; 2:4) in the fact that God's judgment will come to the neighboring Philistines. The reasoning is then expounded upon in two extended units that each begin with the particle "Woe" and bemoan the state and fate of the rebels from the surrounding foreign nations (2:5–15) and from Jerusalem (3:1–7). Jerusalem's rebellious and defiled nature (3:1) will make her a co-recipient of God's wrath with her neighbors, and the people's only hope for survival is to seek the Lord together.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-586-16"></span><span id="page-586-13"></span><span id="page-586-11"></span><span id="page-586-1"></span>2:1–2 Chapter 1 described Judah's idolatry and complacency (1:4–6, 12) and the resulting horrific punishment awaiting them (1:7–18). With two conjoined commands to "gather," Zephaniah now transitions to a message of instruction and further warning for all in Judah who have ears to hear. The Hebrew root translated "gather" is usually used for the collection of straw or sticks and often appears in contexts of chastisement (Ex. 15:7; Isa. 5:24; Nah. 1:10). Here, however, the imagery appears more positive. Just as desirable straw or grain is collected after separating the chaff, the remnant of faithful ones must bundle themselves in unity and separate from all that is destined for the fires of God's just wrath (2 Chron. 20:4; Joel 1:14–15; cf. Heb. 10:24–25).

<span id="page-586-10"></span><span id="page-586-6"></span><span id="page-586-3"></span>The prophet calls his listeners in Judah a "shameless nation," literally one that "does not long" for the Lord (cf. the use of the same verb at the beginning of Ps. 84:2). He then asserts that there is hope for any who act quickly and return to God. Zephaniah's repetition of the preposition "before" highlights how fleeting the opportunity to repent truly is, and his double use of "the anger of the Lord," first with "burning" and then with "the day of," emphasizes the seriousness of his call (cf. Heb. 10:31). Like a mother in labor, Yahweh's purposes will soon "give birth" (ESV = "take[s] effect") to his "decree" to punish the wicked. Repentance cannot wait! The day of wrath will come and go quickly, like windblown "chaff" (cf. Isa. 29:5).

<span id="page-586-21"></span><span id="page-586-18"></span><span id="page-586-17"></span><span id="page-586-12"></span><span id="page-586-9"></span><span id="page-586-8"></span><span id="page-586-4"></span>2:3 The gathering of the remnant was for a more ultimate purpose––that they may together "seek the Lord," which is then described as pursuing "righteousness" and "humility." While rebels, proud in their own way, turn their backs on God (1:6; 3:2), the humble "do his just commands" (likely those given through Moses; cf. Ps. 15:2; Prov. 21:15). Repentance demands that people reorient their entire being toward God (cf. Isa. 51:1; Amos 5:6), and it is something experienced only by the "humble," those broken in spirit (i.e., "bowed, bent" under life's pressures) who recognize their neediness and live in earnest dependence on God (Zeph. 3:12; cf. Ps. 37:11; Isa. 11:4). Turning from self-exaltation to God-exaltation, the "humble" must "seek humility" at even deeper levels.

<span id="page-586-20"></span><span id="page-586-19"></span><span id="page-586-5"></span>Furthermore, having spurned the chaos of injustice and rebellion, those treasuring right order (evidenced in the keeping of God's "just commands") should "seek righteousness." Yahweh's righteousness (Zeph. 3:5) includes both his right regard for his infinite value and his commitment to act in accordance with this value and align everything with it. Human righteousness is evident wherever God's righteousness is mirrored––wherever people define correct order in the cosmos (Pss. 89:14; 119:75) and community (Gen. 18:19; Deut. 16:20; Ps. 15:2) as the valuing of God and of his image in others. Thus righteousness is often associated with acts of justice, especially for the marginalized (cf. Isa. 1:21–23). Zephaniah's Judah too quickly departed from this type of righteousness (Zeph. 1:9; 3:1–5).

<span id="page-586-15"></span><span id="page-586-14"></span><span id="page-586-7"></span><span id="page-586-2"></span><span id="page-586-0"></span>While the Lord will find and destroy every rebel on his day of judgment (1:12, 18; cf. Deut. 7:20; Amos 9:3), heeding Zephaniah's threefold charge opens the <span id="page-587-5"></span><span id="page-587-2"></span>possibility of being "hidden," with God as one's refuge (cf. Ps. 27:5; Jer. 36:26). By using "perhaps," Zephaniah helps his hearers hope in—but not presume upon divine favor (Joel 2:14; Amos 5:15; Jonah 3:9; Acts 8:22). Elsewhere, the prophet emphasizes both the true potential of reconciliation with God (Zeph. 3:7) and the certainty that the Lord will preserve a humble remnant (2:7, 9; 3:11–20).

<span id="page-587-11"></span><span id="page-587-10"></span><span id="page-587-9"></span><span id="page-587-8"></span>2:4 As clarified by the causal conjunction "For," God's promise to destroy the foreign rebels from nearby Philistia is part of Zephaniah's motivation to Judah to heed his call to pursue the Lord. The point appears to be that the punishment is close to home and will reach them if they fail to repent (cf. 3:6–7). Ordered south to north, "Gaza . . . Ashkelon . . . Ashdod . . . Ekron" are four of the five Philistine cities located west of Israel along the Mediterranean Sea. Gath's absence from the list is common among the prophets (cf. Jer. 25:20; Amos 1:6–8; Zech. 9:5–7) and is likely due to either its early destruction (Amos 6:2) or its close association with Israel throughout history (e.g., 1 Sam. 27:1–7).

### COMMIT TO COMMUNITY WITH OTHER BELIEVERS

<span id="page-587-15"></span><span id="page-587-14"></span><span id="page-587-6"></span>God never intended us to attempt to cross the deserts of life alone, nor does he want us to celebrate his provisions and protections on our own. Other people are part of his means for helping us persevere, and they are to be partners in our praises to God. This is why Zephaniah's charge opens by calling the remnant to "gather *together*" (2:1). The writer of Hebrews urges his readers to "exhort one another every day" (Heb. 3:13) and "consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, . . . and all the more as you see the Day drawing near" (Heb. 10:24–25). This "Day" is the very "day of the anger of the Lord" to which Zephaniah points (Zeph. 2:2–3). Partnership with other believers, especially through active local church membership, helps us continue to grow in holiness, "without which no one will see the Lord" (Heb. 12:14).

Jesus highlighted how God's kingdom is reserved for "the poor in spirit" and how it is the "meek" who will inherit the earth (Matt. 5:3, 5; cf. Ps. 37:11). He also stressed the priority and blessing of seeking God's "kingdom" and "righteousness" (Matt. 5:6; 6:33), which includes extending mercy to others and working for peace (5:7, 9)—the same mercy and peace we have received from the Lord (Deut. 10:17–19; 1 John 4:10–11). Righteousness and humility thus go hand in hand, for right order exists only when we turn from all forms of pride and instead value God above ourselves and also value his image in others.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-588-18"></span><span id="page-588-15"></span><span id="page-588-11"></span>2:5–3:7 Zephaniah now develops the basis for his charge to "seek the Lord" (2:3–4). The righteous remnant should patiently pursue the Lord together because he has promised to judge not only the rebels of the foreign nations that surround them (2:5–15) but also those from Jerusalem (3:1–7). Each expanded reason for looking and longing begins with the term "Woe" (2:5; 3:1) and laments the state and fate of the respective groups.

<span id="page-588-17"></span><span id="page-588-16"></span><span id="page-588-12"></span>2:5–15 Building off the initial sentence delivered against Philistia in verse 4, Zephaniah now builds a four-pointed compass of punishment around Judah, beginning with the neighboring rival Philistines to the west (vv. 5–7), then the Moabites and Ammonites to the east (vv. 8–11), and then the imperial powers of the Cushites and Assyrians to the south and north (vv. 12–15). It is implied that the divine punishment spanning the populated world will reach Judah (cf. Hab. 2:16–17), so their only hope is to return to the Lord and become part of the preserved remnant (Zeph. 2:3, 7, 9).

<span id="page-588-14"></span><span id="page-588-13"></span><span id="page-588-10"></span><span id="page-588-9"></span><span id="page-588-8"></span><span id="page-588-6"></span>2:5–7 The term rendered "woe" (v. 5) expresses angst due to disgust over covenant rebellion and idolatry (e.g., Hab. 2:12, 19) and/or dismay over impending doom (e.g., Jer. 30:7). Both possibilities seem operative here. Zephaniah employs the particle to introduce his two reasons why Judah should patiently pursue the Lord (Zeph. 2:5–15; 3:1–7). He directs his "woe" at "the Cherethites," a people known more commonly as the Philistines, who dwelled on the Mediterranean's eastern "seacoast" just west of Judah (2:5; cf. Ezek. 25:16). God promises to eradicate the evil ones completely, changing their cities of wickedness into "pastures" for "the remnant of the house of Judah."

<span id="page-588-7"></span><span id="page-588-5"></span><span id="page-588-4"></span><span id="page-588-3"></span>The prophets regularly employ pastoral imagery to depict fertility and peace for the remnant of God's people (Zeph. 2:7; 3:13; Isa. 5:17; 65:10), especially in relation to the age of restoration that will be led by a shepherd from the line of David (Jer. 23:1–8; Ezek. 34:11–16, 20–31; Mic. 5:2–4).8 Yahweh's "mindfulness" (Zeph. 2:7) points to his active care and redemption––he will "restore their fortunes" (Deut. 30:3; Jer. 30:18; Hos. 6:11). That the remnant will lodge in what was Philistia (Zeph. 2:7) suggests that the earthly kingdom of God's reign is beginning to expand to include the whole planet, as was the goal from the beginning (Gen. 1:28; 22:17b–18; 26:3–4; Rom. 4:13). All this will come about after God pours out his wrath on the world.

<span id="page-588-2"></span><span id="page-588-1"></span><span id="page-588-0"></span>2:8–11 The section continues with God's promising to punish the Moabites and Ammonites, Judah's cousins to the east (cf. Gen. 19:36–38), who had a history of oppressing Israel (Deut. 23:3–4; 2 Kings 13:20; 2 Chron. 20:1). Their more protected, elevated location on the Gilead Plateau east of the Jordan often resulted in

<span id="page-588-19"></span><sup>8</sup> The NT points to Jesus as the one great or chief shepherd who has, through his sacrificial death and triumphant resurrection, already initiated the hoped-for rest for all who believe in him, whether Jew or Gentile (John 10:14–16; Rev. 7:15–17).

<span id="page-589-18"></span><span id="page-589-17"></span><span id="page-589-14"></span><span id="page-589-8"></span>a superiority complex characterized by delight in others' destruction (cf. Isa. 16:6; Jer. 48:27–30; Ezek. 25:3, 6). Therefore, with a strong oath, Israel's all-powerful God ("the Lord of hosts [armies]"), promises to act on behalf of his own (Zeph. 2:9). He will confront the fresh "boasts" (v. 8) and "pride" (v. 10) of these highlanders by making them "like Sodom" and "Gomorrah," the very cities overcome by curse in the days of Lot, the forefather of these peoples (Gen. 19:24–26; cf. 2 Pet. 2:6; Rev. 11:8). Rather than being a place of life, this agrarian society would be devastated and depopulated, like a desert wasteland (cf. Gen. 13:10; Isa. 7:23–25; Jer. 17:6).

<span id="page-589-22"></span><span id="page-589-16"></span><span id="page-589-5"></span><span id="page-589-2"></span><span id="page-589-1"></span><span id="page-589-0"></span>As with the judgment sentence on Philistia (Zeph. 2:6–7), this portrayal of complete desolation is tempered by the fact that a remnant of survivors from Judah will both "plunder" and "possess" the Moabites and Ammonites (v. 9). This disinheriting shows partial fulfillment of God's original commission for his human image-bearers to fill and subdue the earth (Gen. 1:28). Even more, the possession likely includes not only the claiming of territory (Deut. 31:7) but also the inclusion of a remnant of these once-enemy peoples within the newly transformed people of God (Isa. 14:2; cf. 56:6–8), all of whom would together serve Yahweh their God and the new David their king (cf. Jer. 30:9 with Hos. 3:5; Amos 9:11–12 with Acts 15:16–18).

<span id="page-589-21"></span><span id="page-589-19"></span><span id="page-589-15"></span><span id="page-589-13"></span><span id="page-589-7"></span><span id="page-589-6"></span><span id="page-589-4"></span><span id="page-589-3"></span>Zephaniah 2:11 opens by declaring that Moab and Ammon are confronted with the Lord's "awesome" nature––that overwhelming quality associated with his incomparability in character and deed, often manifested in his wars of judgment (Ex. 15:11; Deut. 7:21; Joel 2:11, 31; Mal. 4:5). This encounter is certain because ("for") the Lord "will famish all the gods of the earth." Here the focus is on the sole sovereign of the universe (Deut. 5:7; 10:17; Ps 95:3) diminishing all evil spiritual powers standing against him (cf. Jer. 50:2; 51:44), whether actual or imagined (Deut. 32:17; Ps. 106:37; 1 Cor. 10:19–20). And though it is not evident to the English reader, the Hebrew form of the verb "will famish" stresses that the Lord's intention is so certain that it is as if he has already overcome. He will indeed defeat all evil! Those in Judah should thus stop seeking help from "gods" that cannot save (Isa. 43:10–11; 45:21; Hos. 13:4), for in the end, foreign rebels and remnant alike from the most distant "lands" will recognize Yahweh as preeminent (cf. Zeph. 3:9–10, 15, 19; Isa. 45:23; Phil. 2:10–11).

<span id="page-589-20"></span><span id="page-589-12"></span><span id="page-589-11"></span><span id="page-589-10"></span><span id="page-589-9"></span>2:12–15 Zephaniah's compass of punishment now continues by highlighting the Cushites to the south and the Assyrians to the north. The Cushites were black Africans from ancient Ethiopia, located south of ancient Egypt in the region of modern Sudan. At times Israel looked to them rather than to God for help (Isa. 20:5–6), but the Lord here declares their judgment and his sufficiency. Most English versions understand this to be a prophecy of the future (so ESV), although it is possible the Hebrew could refer to a past event, which in this case could be Assyria's destruction of the twenty-fifth (Cushite) dynasty of Egypt in 663 BC, a generation before Zephaniah's ministry (cf. Isa. 20:1–6). If so, the reference to Cush/Egypt's demise would supply proof that Assyria's empire, highlighted in the Z ephaniah 2:1–3:7 590

<span id="page-590-15"></span>following verses, would also fall (Zeph. 2:13–15; cf. Nah. 3:8–13). In either case, the fact that the Lord refers to his own "sword" makes clear that the destruction is from his hand.

<span id="page-590-16"></span><span id="page-590-14"></span><span id="page-590-7"></span><span id="page-590-3"></span>Turning to Assyria, the Lord promises to "stretch out his hand" of vengeance against them (Zeph. 2:13; cf. 1:4). Assyria was the notorious northern superpower who controlled the Near East from 870 to 626 BC and conquered the northern kingdom's capital of Samaria in 723, resulting in Israel's exile (2 Kings 17; cf. Isa. 10:5). The Lord pledges that Nineveh, Assyria's onetime capital, would become a wasteland (cf. Nah. 3:7), with domestic and wild animals replacing humans as the inhabitants of what used to be a center of human power (Zeph. 2:13–14). The buildings will be ruined, and their strong, imported framing (2 Kings 19:23; cf. 1 Kings 5:6; 7:2; Ezra 3:7)—once a sign of grandeur and security—will be rendered useless (Zeph. 2:14; cf. Ezek. 31:3).

<span id="page-590-23"></span><span id="page-590-13"></span><span id="page-590-12"></span><span id="page-590-9"></span><span id="page-590-8"></span><span id="page-590-4"></span><span id="page-590-2"></span>The Lord detests pride and will root it out (Zeph. 3:11; cf. Isa. 47:8, 10; Ezek. 28:2). Nineveh "lived securely," claiming a preeminence reserved for God alone (Isa. 45:5–6, 18, 21–22; 46:9; Mark 12:32). Their security was false, and their destruction certain. Zephaniah's confidence that God would soon act led him to talk as if Nineveh's judgment were already accomplished––"What a desolation she *has become*" (Zeph. 2:15). Those passing by will express both horror and affirmation as they observe how the brutal oppressor has fallen (cf. Jer. 19:8; Nah. 3:19)––a feat accomplished by the Medes and Babylonians in 612 BC.

<span id="page-590-25"></span><span id="page-590-24"></span><span id="page-590-22"></span><span id="page-590-21"></span><span id="page-590-20"></span><span id="page-590-18"></span><span id="page-590-11"></span>3:1 The preceding lament against the rebels from foreign nations (2:5–15) implied Judah's coming destruction, but 3:1–7 now makes her ruin explicit and clarifies that it will be experienced by Jerusalem in particular (vv. 5–7). Indeed, the inclusion of "Woe" in 3:1 corresponds with 2:5, so that 3:1–7 stands parallel to 2:5–15. In short, God's judgment overviewed in 2:5–15 will ultimately fall on Judah, resulting in her ruin. Why? Because Jerusalem was "rebellious and defiled" (cf. 1:4–6, 12). Far from displaying pure and undefiled religion by imaging the impartiality and justice of God toward the marginalized, Jerusalem became characterized by oppression (cf. 1:9; 3:3–5; Isa. 1:21–23; Ezek. 22:6–7, 29). The Lord called Israel to be holy, to display his unique and absolute worth to the nations through lives of surrendered obedience (Ex. 19:5–6; Lev. 20:25–26; Deut. 7:6; 26:19; cf. 1 Pet. 2:9). Instead, Judah's idolatry (Zeph. 1:4–5), oppression of the weak (1:9; 3:1, 3–5), and heartlessness toward God (1:6; 3:2) polluted them, rendering them unfit for lasting relationship with the Lord (cf. Isa. 59:3; Mal. 1:7).

<span id="page-590-27"></span><span id="page-590-26"></span><span id="page-590-19"></span><span id="page-590-17"></span><span id="page-590-10"></span><span id="page-590-6"></span><span id="page-590-5"></span><span id="page-590-1"></span><span id="page-590-0"></span>3:2 At the core, Jerusalem was both deaf and stubbornly heedless, neither listening to the voice of the prophets nor learning from God's correcting hand (cf. v. 7; Jer. 7:28). God's discipline was designed to lead them to repentance (Lev. 26:18; Ps. 119:71; Hos. 6:1), but they remained indifferent (Jer. 5:3; Amos 4:6; Hag. 2:17; Rev. 16:9). The result of their internal resistance was a lack of any response to God; the rebel majority had neither trusted the Lord nor drawn near to him in faith. The latter image may point to approaching God through his provision of a sacrificial

<span id="page-591-11"></span><span id="page-591-10"></span><span id="page-591-1"></span>substitute (Lev. 9:1–10:3). In failing to trust, they turned from their only help and shield (Pss. 62:8; 115:9–11). In refusing the King's invitation to access, they were rejecting their only refuge and consigning themselves to divine wrath (Ps. 73:28; cf. Heb. 4:16).

<span id="page-591-28"></span><span id="page-591-22"></span><span id="page-591-20"></span><span id="page-591-19"></span><span id="page-591-17"></span><span id="page-591-0"></span>3:3–5 Jerusalem's civil and religious leaders had been instigators in the city's oppressive character (cf. 1:8–9). The first group (3:3) includes the "officials," who oversaw governmental and military affairs, with some influence on religious life (cf. 1:8; Jer. 26:10; 36:12, 21; 43:5), and the "judges," who settled legal disputes (Ex. 18:21–22; Deut. 16:18–19; 17:9). Rather than serving as shepherds who guard their sheep, they had become like wild beasts, threatening and ravenous to the weak and poor (Ezek. 22:25, 27; cf. Mic. 3:1–3). The second group (Zeph. 3:4) includes the "prophets" and "priests." Rather than serving as God's mouthpieces and covenant ambassadors (Deut. 18:18; 2 Kings 17:13; Zech. 7:11–12), the "prophets" had sought false visions and divined lies, tickling sinful ears with destructive words that did not come from God (Jer. 23:16–22; Ezekiel 13; 22:25, 28). Similarly, turning from their two main responsibilities of defining holiness and teaching God's law (Lev. 10:10–11; Deut. 33:10; Mal. 2:5–7), the "priests" had failed at both points and had led others to do the same (Ezek. 22:26; Mal. 2:8–11).

<span id="page-591-23"></span><span id="page-591-18"></span><span id="page-591-16"></span><span id="page-591-8"></span><span id="page-591-6"></span><span id="page-591-5"></span><span id="page-591-2"></span>In contrast to these "unjust" overseers who showed no sense of disgrace ("no shame") for their sins, the Lord "is righteous" (Zeph. 3:5). That is, the one inhabiting Jerusalem is unswerving in his passion to preserve and display right order, wherein he is shown to be supreme, justice is upheld, and his image in others is respected (cf. comment on 2:3). This God "does no injustice" (cf. Deut. 32:4; Job 34:10; Ps. 18:30). Loving legal order (Ps. 37:28), he is constantly working justice within the community (Deut. 32:4; cf. Deut. 1:17; Isa. 51:4) and will establish it wholly at his day of judgment (Zeph. 3:8; cf. Pss. 9:16; 96:13). The question for those in Jerusalem is whether they would be recipients of God's mercy (Lam. 3:22–23) and operate as agents of God's justice (Jer. 21:12) or would stand as objects of his wrath (Isa. 28:18–19).

<span id="page-591-27"></span><span id="page-591-26"></span><span id="page-591-25"></span><span id="page-591-24"></span><span id="page-591-21"></span><span id="page-591-15"></span><span id="page-591-14"></span><span id="page-591-13"></span><span id="page-591-12"></span><span id="page-591-9"></span><span id="page-591-7"></span><span id="page-591-4"></span><span id="page-591-3"></span>3:6–7 Building off the remark in verse 2 that Jerusalem "accepts no correction," God now clarifies the context (vv. 6–7a) and nature (v. 7b) of his people's stubborn heedlessness. The context is the Lord's destroying many of the surrounding earthly kingdoms (v. 6; cf. comment on 2:12–15). We are told that he did so as a lesson to Judah––his purpose being to motivate his own people to take sin seriously and "fear" him, here defined as accepting "correction" (3:7a). "Fear" is the proper human disposition of respect or worship toward God arising from awe of his sovereignty (Eccles. 3:14; Isa. 8:13). Godward fear is evident when people magnify God's greatness and ability (Mal. 1:5) and are ashamed of ever looking to created powers for ultimate help (Isa. 20:5–6). Fearing gods other than Yahweh instigated the collapse of the northern kingdom (2 Kings 17:7), and the very covenant curses God "appointed" would soon reach Judah as well, resulting in the full removal of God's provision and protection (Zeph. 3:7; cf. Lev. 26:14–39; Deut. 28:15–68).

Deut. 32:5; Isa. 1:4; Jer. 6:28; Hos. 9:9) was a failure to "fear" Yahweh, which showed itself in sustained idolatry (Zeph. 1:4–5), self-rule and lack of God-dependence (1:6; 3:2), apathy (1:12), lack of passion for the Lord (2:1), and social and religious oppression and manipulation (1:9; 3:1, 3–4). All of this foolishness paralleled the "corruption" that brought about the flood (Gen. 6:11–12), and it would result ultimately in a comparable fate (cf. Zeph. 1:2–4, 18; 3:11; 2 Pet. 3:5–7).

## TURN FROM PRIDE AND OPPRESSION TO HUMILITY AND LOVE, WHILE THERE IS STILL HOPE

<span id="page-592-14"></span><span id="page-592-13"></span><span id="page-592-12"></span><span id="page-592-5"></span>Zephaniah takes great effort to equate the state and fate of the faithless Israelites in Jerusalem—earlier called "the remnant of Baal" (1:4)—with those of their pagan neighbors. Like the nations who elevated themselves at the expense of others (2:8, 10, 15), Jerusalem, under the direction of its leaders, was oppressive and unjust to its own (3:1, 3–4). And just as Yahweh promised to destroy the nations for their sin (2:5, 9, 13), he would also cut off Jerusalem, desolating the city (3:7). In famishing the gods of the earth, the Lord promises to remove every false security in which mankind foolishly trusts, and the result will be that every human will bow to him, whether as faithful remnant or defeated rebel (2:11; cf. Phil. 2:10–11; Rev. 5:8–14). He "will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire" (Matt. 3:12; cf. Zeph. 2:1–2).

Rom. 13:11, 14). If it was foolish in Zephaniah's day to trust in foreign powers, whether spiritual or earthly (Zeph. 2:11; 3:6–7), how much more foolish is it today now that Christ has *already* "disarmed the rulers and authorities . . . by triumphing over them" (Col. 2:15). "Before the decree takes effect" (Zeph. 2:2), we must turn from pride and oppression to humility and love, for only in such a context is there hope for being part of the remnant that God will save (2:3, 7, 9).

## <span id="page-592-11"></span><span id="page-592-10"></span>FEAR GOD AND LEARN FROM HIS MERCIFUL DISCIPLINE

<span id="page-592-17"></span><span id="page-592-1"></span>Zephaniah stresses that our righteous God (3:5) is ever ready to pardon and restore any who "fear" him, who "accept correction" (v. 7). Sinners should stand in wonder over this promise, awed by a merciful God whose revealed purpose in discipline is to redeem rebels (Lev. 26:14–16, 18, 21, 23–24, 27–28). Rather than bringing immediate death, God often bestows kindness, forbearance, and patience in order to generate repentance (Rom. 2:4) and awaken new or sustained faith in his future grace (Rom. 11:20–22; cf. Rev. 3:19). The majority in Judah remained unresponsive to God's correction (Zeph. 3:2, 7). Will we?

<span id="page-592-22"></span><span id="page-592-20"></span><span id="page-592-19"></span><span id="page-592-16"></span><span id="page-592-3"></span>For those in the new covenant, Christ has fully borne the curse on our behalf (Gal. 3:13), taking upon himself the punishment for our sin, freeing us from the Lord's wrath, and reconciling us to God (Isa. 53:5, 11; Rom. 5:9, 18; 2 Cor.

<span id="page-593-4"></span><span id="page-593-3"></span><span id="page-593-2"></span>5:21). Nevertheless, in this overlap between the old and new creation, we still face many of the original effects of the fall and thus we need divine discipline to shape within us the "holiness without which no one will see the Lord" (Heb. 12:14). God "disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness" (Heb. 12:10). May we not spurn the Lord's merciful pursuit of our souls through discipline. Instead, may we fear him, resting in his new covenant promise that he will enable for his elect the very fear and passionate following that he commands (Jer. 32:40).

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-594-1"></span>Earlier Zephaniah called the remnant of Judah to "seek the Lord together" (2:1–3) in order to avoid punishment. He now adds that they must "wait" for the Lord (3:8) in order to enjoy satisfying salvation. He initially gives two reasons why they should wait upon God, each beginning with the conjunction "For" or "because." They should pursue him with patience *because* he still intends to punish evil (v. 8b) and *because* he is still committed to purifying a global community of worshipers (vv. 9–10). Zephaniah then ends the book by developing the ultimate motivation for why the remnant should persist in their trust. Declaring what will take place "On that day" (vv. 11–13, 16–20), and calling the remnant to rejoice (vv. 14–15), Zephaniah highlights the satisfying salvation awaiting all who endure.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-595-11"></span><span id="page-595-9"></span><span id="page-595-8"></span>3:8a The opening "Therefore" highlights that the trustful endurance for which verse 8 calls is the necessary logical response to the global and local rebellion and the prospect of punishment detailed in the previous unit (2:4–3:7). In the Hebrew, the command "wait" is in a form different than the verbs in the preceding verses but similar to those in 2:1, 3. This suggests that Zephaniah's focus has turned away from warning back to positive exhortation, as found in 2:1, 3. The prophet's main charge directs the remnant to persist patiently in hope for the salvation that God will bring on the other side of punishment (cf. Ps. 33:20; Isa. 64:4; Dan. 12:12; Hab. 2:3), which will occur only after God rises as righteous accuser and judge.

<span id="page-595-6"></span><span id="page-595-0"></span>Debate surrounds the translation of one word in the last part of verse 8a, which is understood either as a term for "prey" (so ESV: "for the day when I rise up to seize the prey"), or, with the slightest change to the Hebrew, as a term for "witness, to testify" (so NIV: "for the day I will stand up *to testify*"). The term "witness" occurs in similar contexts (Jer. 29:23; 42:5; Mic. 1:2; Mal. 3:5), but either translation is plausible and fits the context here.

<span id="page-595-2"></span>3:8b–10 There are two reasons why the remnant from Judah should continue to "wait" for the Lord: (1) because he intends to punish the wicked of the earth (v. 8b), and (2) because he will save a remnant from the nations, reversing the effects of the Tower of Babel (vv. 9–10).

<span id="page-595-7"></span><span id="page-595-5"></span><span id="page-595-4"></span><span id="page-595-3"></span><span id="page-595-1"></span>3:8b The first reason the remnant of Judah must persist in their hope of salvation is that God's intention to punish all the earth's rebels remains unrealized (cf. Hab. 1:2; 3:17–19). Nevertheless, like those who prepare metal for melting (Ezek. 22:19–22) or prepare sheaves for threshing (Mic. 4:12–13), God has determined to "gather" (Ezek. 16:37; Joel 3:2; Zeph. 3:18; Zech. 14:2–3) all people groups ("nations") and political powers ("kingdoms") for judicial assessment (cf. Isa. 24:22). At that time, his molten jealousy for the honor of his name will finally "pour out" upon "all the earth," destroying all those hostile to him (cf. Zeph. 1:17–18). Because the coming

<span id="page-596-10"></span>punishment is certain, the remnant of Judah must continue to wait in hope, confident that God will act (Isa. 64:4).

<span id="page-596-14"></span><span id="page-596-12"></span><span id="page-596-4"></span><span id="page-596-1"></span>3:9–10 The second reason Zephaniah gives for Judah's remnant to persist in Godward trust is that on the very day of his judicial sentencing ("On that day"; 1:9), the Lord will cleanse the surviving peoples' speech, generating a unified profession that will result in unified service to him (3:9; cf. Rev. 7:9–10). The imagery of speech purification implies the overturning of judgment (Ps. 55:9) and likely alludes to a reversal of the Tower of Babel episode, where a communal pride against God resulted in his confusing of "language/speech" and his "dispersing" the rebels across the globe (Gen. 11:7, 9). To call on Yahweh's name (cf. Zeph. 3:12) is outwardly to express worshipful dependence on him as one's savior, king, and treasure (Ps. 116:4, 13, 17). The prophets often linked calling on Yahweh's name with the day of the Lord and the future work of God in the messianic era (e.g., Isa. 12:4; Joel 2:28–32; Zech. 13:9). The apostles believed that Christ inaugurated this period of God-centered speech and heart-change at Pentecost and that it included salvation for Jews and Gentiles alike (Acts 2:21; Rom. 10:13).

<span id="page-596-18"></span><span id="page-596-13"></span><span id="page-596-9"></span><span id="page-596-8"></span><span id="page-596-7"></span><span id="page-596-6"></span><span id="page-596-0"></span>"Cush" was ancient Ethiopia, at that time the center of black Africa (located in modern Sudan). Its "rivers" were likely the White and Blue Nile (cf. Isa. 18:1–2). As if following the rivers of life back to the garden of Eden for fellowship with the great King (Gen. 2:13; cf. Rev. 22:1–2), the prophet envisions that even the most distant lands upon which the Lord has poured his wrath (Zeph. 2:11–12) will include a remnant of "worshipers" whom God's presence will compel to the new Jerusalem. As many prophets anticipate (e.g., Isa. 2:2–3; Jer. 3:17; Zech. 8:23), the people of the new covenant—here described as a "daughter" of the dispersed—will include a worldwide, multiethnic community descending from the seventy families the Lord "dispersed" in punishment at Babel after the flood (Gen. 11:8–9). Indeed, even some from Cush, Zephaniah's own heritage (Zeph. 1:1), would gain new birth certificates declaring that they were born in Zion (Ps. 87:4; Isa. 45:14). This entire picture is now realized eternally in the church (Matt. 28:18–20; Romans 11; Eph. 2:11–22; Rev. 5:9–10; 7:9–10).

REJOICE THAT THE CHURCH FULFILLS OT HOPES FOR A SINGLE RECONCILED COMMUNITY FROM EVERY TRIBE AND TONGUE

<span id="page-596-3"></span>After the day of divine wrath, Zephaniah envisions God's blessing of reconciliation reaching the nations (3:9–10), thus fulfilling the hopes of the Abrahamic covenant (Gen. 12:3; 22:18). The prophet is, therefore, painting a picture of the messianic new covenant age of the church, in which Jews and Gentiles in Christ are now one flock (John 10:16; cf. 11:51–52; 12:19–20), a single olive tree (Rom. 11:17–24), and one new man (Eph. 2:11–22).

<span id="page-596-17"></span><span id="page-596-15"></span>Pentecost inaugurated the change of speech and unity that Zephaniah predicted (Zeph. 3:9–10). While Peter's sermon in Acts 2 directly cites the latter-days predic<span id="page-597-9"></span><span id="page-597-8"></span><span id="page-597-7"></span><span id="page-597-3"></span><span id="page-597-2"></span>tion from Joel 2:28–32, the day of the Lord imagery and the stress on calling on the Lord's name (Acts 2:19–21) closely parallel what was anticipated by Zephaniah (Zeph. 1:15; 3:8–9). Zephaniah 3:9 predicts transformed "speech" (LXX = "tongue") and united devotion, neither of which Joel emphasizes but both of which Luke's narrative highlights by noting the early church's transformed "tongues" (Acts 2:4), which led to a united commitment "to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers" (Acts 2:42). Furthermore, Zephaniah's use of ancient Ethiopia/Cush as his sole example of God's end-time redemption of a multiethnic community of worshipers helps explain Luke's otherwise intrusive narrative of the Ethiopian eunuch's salvation in Acts 8:26–40. Luke is noting the initial fulfillment of Zephaniah's vision of restoration. In Christ's atoning work, the blessing of God has moved from "Jerusalem . . . to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8; cf. Luke 24:47).

<span id="page-597-14"></span><span id="page-597-13"></span><span id="page-597-12"></span><span id="page-597-10"></span><span id="page-597-6"></span><span id="page-597-0"></span>Accordingly, in fulfillment of Zephaniah's hopes for an international remnant of worshipers bringing offerings to God's presence (Zeph. 3:10), the NT stresses that the Lord is already shaping the church into "a kingdom and priests" "from every tribe and language and people and nation" (Rev. 5:9–10; cf. Rev. 7:9–10). Already, as priests, we are offering sacrifices of praise (Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15–16; 1 Pet. 2:5) at "Mount Zion and . . . the heavenly Jerusalem" (Heb. 12:22; cf. Isa. 2:2–3; Zech. 8:20–23; Gal. 4:26). Nevertheless, we await the day on which the "new Jerusalem" will descend from heaven as (or to) the new earth (Rev. 21:2, 10; cf. Isa. 65:17–18), when our daily journey to find rest in Christ's supremacy and sufficiency (Matt. 11:28–29; John 6:35) will come to completion in a place where the curse is no more (Rev. 21:22–22:5).

<span id="page-597-16"></span><span id="page-597-15"></span><span id="page-597-5"></span><span id="page-597-4"></span><span id="page-597-1"></span>ACT ON THE FACT THAT GOD SAVES WORSHIPERS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Convinced that the fires of God's wrath have already fallen on Jesus for *all* who will call upon the name of the Lord, regardless of ethnic heritage (Zeph. 3:8–10), we cannot help but desire that all peoples have the chance to call out to him for mercy and grace. We must hear Paul's urgency:

How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? . . . So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. (Rom. 10:14–15, 17)

<span id="page-597-11"></span>May the joy of knowing that God saves worshipers without ethnic prejudice compel us to share the good news with others, that they too may call upon the name of the Lord! The marvel of salvation should motivate missions.

#### WAIT FOR THE LORD

Believers today live in the overlap of the ages––*after* Yahweh has atoned for the sin of his elect through the death of his Son but *before* he has eradicated all evil <span id="page-598-23"></span><span id="page-598-12"></span><span id="page-598-9"></span><span id="page-598-3"></span>and carried out the final judgment. The *already* aspects require us to call on his name and serve him together (Zeph. 3:9–10). The *not yet* aspects necessitate that we heed Zephaniah's charge to persist in patient trust in the Lord ("wait"; 3:8), holding unswervingly to the only God, who "acts for those who wait for him" (Isa. 64:4). Waiting is not easy, for great are the temptations of doubt, compromise, fear, and anxiety. Yet before us is the "crown of life," and everyone "who remains steadfast under trial" will receive it (James 1:12). "The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment" (2 Pet. 2:9), so may we "hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering" and "consider how to stir up one another to love and good works . . . encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near" (Heb. 10:23–25). "And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you" (1 Pet. 5:10).

## <span id="page-598-25"></span><span id="page-598-24"></span><span id="page-598-22"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-598-15"></span><span id="page-598-14"></span>3:11–20 These verses supply the most personal, ultimate motivation for the faithful in Judah and beyond to continue "waiting" for God. The restoration to come on the other side of God's judgment will include the Lord's removal of shame and his preservation of the humble (vv. 11–13), his bringing their joy to completion in light of his irreversible victory (vv. 14–15), and his culmination of worldwide deliverance for the glory of his name (vv. 16–20).

<span id="page-598-19"></span><span id="page-598-18"></span><span id="page-598-13"></span><span id="page-598-11"></span><span id="page-598-10"></span><span id="page-598-8"></span>3:11a "On that day" of judicial action (cf. v. 8a), God will *not* put to shame the city of Jerusalem that once rebelled against him. Whereas Zephaniah addressed all members of the remnant community in verses 8–10, the Hebrew makes clear that the prophet now returns to speaking directly to the city as a collective unit (cf. vv. 1–7). In divine mercy, his "appointed" decree to curse Jerusalem (v. 7; cf. 2:2) will not result in complete annihilation. He will protect his faithful remnant (cf. 2:3, 7, 9) so that, while the rebels will be punished, the city itself will not be put to shame (cf. Isa. 45:17; Joel 2:26–27; Rom. 10:11).

<span id="page-598-16"></span><span id="page-598-7"></span><span id="page-598-6"></span><span id="page-598-4"></span><span id="page-598-2"></span>3:11b–13 Jerusalem will not experience shame because the Lord will perform two contrasting actions related to those in Jerusalem, each with shame-averting results for the city. First, God will expel from his "holy mountain" the self-reliant, complacent abusers (v. 11; cf. 1:8–13; 3:1–4; Mal. 4:1) so that man-centered pride will no longer characterize the city, and the mountain's heights will testify to God's greatness, not mankind's (cf. Isa. 2:2, 11).

<span id="page-598-21"></span><span id="page-598-20"></span><span id="page-598-17"></span><span id="page-598-5"></span><span id="page-598-1"></span><span id="page-598-0"></span>Second, the Lord will leave the "humble and lowly" (Zeph. 3:12). Relinquished of its rebels, the (new) covenant community will be made up only of the regenerated remnant, whose own lives reflect that of the messianic king (Zech. 9:9; Matt. 11:29; Phil. 2:7–8). These are the afflicted but dependent who, before "the day" of wrath took effect (Zeph. 2:2), heeded the prophetic call to pursue the Lord together, persevering through suffering and finding shelter in God (2:1, 3; 3:8; cf. Isa. 14:32; <span id="page-599-22"></span><span id="page-599-19"></span><span id="page-599-16"></span><span id="page-599-3"></span>Matt. 5:3). This multiethnic throng of worshipers, gathered to Jerusalem for praise and prayer (Zeph. 3:9–10), makes up the newly defined "remnant of Israel" (3:13 AT; cf. 2:7, 9; Psalm 87; Rom. 11:17–24; Gal. 6:16; Eph. 2:11–16). They will continue to "seek refuge" in God (Zeph. 3:12), delighting in his presence and protective care (2:3; 3:5) and resting in his character, power, and promises (Isa. 14:32; 57:13; Nah. 1:7). They will "do no injustice" and "speak no lies" (Zeph. 3:13; cf. 1:9; 3:1–5), as their "pure speech" (3:9) will cancel all deceit (3:13; cf. Rev. 14:5).

<span id="page-599-15"></span><span id="page-599-9"></span><span id="page-599-8"></span><span id="page-599-7"></span><span id="page-599-5"></span><span id="page-599-2"></span>These faithful will flee from sin because ("For") their souls will be at rest, and "none shall make them afraid" (Zeph. 3:13). Like sheep under the care of a good shepherd (Psalm 23; cf. Zeph. 2:6–7), the remnant of the new creation will enjoy provision, protection, and no fear of created things (Jer. 30:10; Ezek. 34:28; Mic. 4:4), and this delight will overflow into commitment to God. Stated differently, the reversal of the curse of being another's prey, in addition to the realization of the restoration blessing of fearlessness (Deut. 28:26; Jer. 7:33), will generate holy living (Lev. 26:5–6; cf. Jer. 32:40; Ezek. 34:25–27).

<span id="page-599-20"></span><span id="page-599-18"></span><span id="page-599-13"></span><span id="page-599-1"></span><span id="page-599-0"></span>3:14–15 Zephaniah's excitement over the portrait of hope unveiled in verses 11–13 now erupts into an unexpected call to celebrate. Here he stacks four imperatives ("Sing aloud," "shout," "rejoice and exult"; v. 14), more than in any other single verse in the book (cf. 2:1, 3; 3:8). He also "crowds the stage" in a climactic way by addressing a number of chief figures from Zephaniah's audience: "daughter" (v. 10), "Zion" (v. 16), "Israel" (2:9; 3:13, 15), and "Jerusalem" (1:4, 12; 3:16).

<span id="page-599-17"></span><span id="page-599-12"></span><span id="page-599-11"></span>The prophet supplies two reasons to rejoice, which relate to (1) what the Lord has done and (2) where the Lord is and what this means. The remnant of Jerusalem should rejoice because Yahweh has removed the curse of enemy oppression and has established himself as sovereign in Israel's midst. In contrast to the rest of the book, which highlights that the day of wrath is still *future* (e.g., 1:7; 2:2; 3:8, 11, 19), in 3:15 Zephaniah acts as though the time of punishment has *already passed*: "The Lord *has taken away* the judgments against you; he *has cleared away* your enemies." The shift from future to past perspective in verse 15 is unexpected and suggests that, for Zephaniah, the certainty of *future* joy after the day of the Lord generates *present* joy amid pain. God's trustworthiness makes the fulfillment of his promise certain and therefore allows our future desire to become present delight (cf. Heb. 12:3 with Hab. 3:17–19; Rom. 5:2).

<span id="page-599-21"></span><span id="page-599-14"></span><span id="page-599-10"></span><span id="page-599-6"></span>Jerusalem's great deliverer is "the King of Israel, the Lord" (Zeph. 3:15), who stands "in your midst." This highlights Yahweh as the true sovereign and only Savior of creation, who reigns preeminent over the gods of the nations (2:11; cf. Isa. 44:6). He is neither complacent nor powerless (Zeph. 1:12), as his overpowering of "all the gods of the earth" has shown (2:11; cf. 3:8). Because this God is for them and with them, they need not fear others (3:15).

<span id="page-599-24"></span><span id="page-599-23"></span><span id="page-599-4"></span>In the NT, Jesus is revealed as the "King of Israel" (cf. Matt. 27:42; Mark 15:32; John 1:49), and it is in light of his coming that the "daughter of Zion" should "fear not" (John 12:13–16; cf. Ps. 118:15–26; Zech. 9:9). While no one questions <span id="page-600-22"></span><span id="page-600-17"></span>that John 12:13–16 draws from Zechariah 9:9 in describing Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the OT citation is not exact, for it includes the call to "fear not" rather than to "rejoice." Furthermore, Zechariah 9:9 may itself be built on Zephaniah 3:14–15, which alone among all OT texts includes together the phrases "King of Israel," "daughter of Zion," and "fear not"––all of which appear in John 12:13–16. It therefore seems likely that John saw Jesus' journey unto death and resurrection as initiating the fulfillment of God's enemy-overcoming end-time rule that Zephaniah foresaw. Jesus is already reigning as "God with us" (Matt. 1:23; cf. John 1:14; 2:21), indwelling his church through his Spirit (Matt. 28:20; John 14:16–20; Rom. 8:9–10; cf. Rev. 21:3), and in so doing he is fulfilling God's promise of divine presence with us (cf. Ezek. 37:23–24 with 2 Cor. 6:16). Christians do not need to fear.

<span id="page-600-24"></span><span id="page-600-23"></span><span id="page-600-20"></span><span id="page-600-18"></span><span id="page-600-16"></span><span id="page-600-13"></span><span id="page-600-12"></span>3:16–20 The historical marker "On that day" (v. 16) refers to "the day" when God rises as judge (v. 8a; cf. 1:7–10, 14–16, 18; 2:2–3). This temporal phrase is identical to the one found at the head of 3:11–13 and thus marks off 3:16–20 as parallel to 3:11–13.

<span id="page-600-19"></span><span id="page-600-5"></span>3:16–18 "On that day" (cf. v. 11 with v. 8a) when "the King of Israel" acts on behalf of his own (v. 15), personified "Jerusalem/Zion" will receive a double command to feel no fear ("Fear not") nor act fearfully ("let not your hands grow weak"; v. 16). "Weak" hands are figurative for a temporary paralysis of the will and body, often caused by shock in the wake of terror (2 Kings 19:26; Job 4:3; Isa. 13:7; Jer. 6:24). Zephaniah believed that, in the day of deliverance, the believing remnant must awaken out of their stupor, confident in God's presence, favor, and sovereignty (Isa. 35:3–5; Heb. 12:12).

<span id="page-600-21"></span><span id="page-600-15"></span><span id="page-600-14"></span><span id="page-600-11"></span><span id="page-600-10"></span><span id="page-600-9"></span><span id="page-600-8"></span><span id="page-600-7"></span><span id="page-600-6"></span><span id="page-600-4"></span><span id="page-600-3"></span><span id="page-600-2"></span><span id="page-600-1"></span><span id="page-600-0"></span>The reason the city may rest at ease is that "the Lord your God is in your midst," not as a vengeful covenant Lord but as a delivering King (Zeph. 3:17; cf. v. 15). The Lord's position in Jerusalem bears two implications. First, as the "mighty one" (Deut. 10:17; Ps. 24:8; Isa. 10:21; 42:13), he will both save and celebrate over his own (Zeph. 3:17b–18). He will rescue the remnant from their sins (vv. 9, 11) and his judgments (v. 15; cf. Isa. 25:4, 8–9; 63:1) and will remove all proud oppressors (Zeph. 3:11, 15, 19). He will revel in his redeemed in a threefold way (v. 17), matching the threefold charge in verse 14: (1) Having cursed Israel (Deut. 28:63), he will again "rejoice/delight" over his restored people, as a bridegroom delights in his bride (Deut. 30:9; Isa. 62:4–5; Jer. 32:41). (2) With the same enduring affection that drove him to remain faithful to a rebellious Israel (Deut. 7:8; Isa. 63:9; Hos. 3:1), God will now "quiet" or calm a once-oppressed remnant with his "love" (Isa. 43:4; Jer. 31:3; Hos. 14:4), making their cries for help unnecessary (cf. Ex. 14:14; Isa. 41:1). (3) Like a parent who takes pleasure in a righteous child (Prov. 23:24–25), the Lord will "exult over" his city, now delivered from the world's cursed and broken nature (Isa. 65:19). Zephaniah 3:17 is the only text in Scripture that showcases how the Lord's treasuring of his beloved will overflow in his "loud singing." Isaiah links this period of divine joy with the new creation (Isa. 65:17–19), which the NT identifies <span id="page-601-17"></span><span id="page-601-16"></span>as beginning at Christ's first coming (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15) and culminating with the descent of the heavenly Jerusalem to earth (2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1–2). Zephaniah is most likely referring to this same already-but-not-yet reality.

<span id="page-601-9"></span>The second implication of God's presence in Jerusalem is that it indicates that the Lord has fulfilled his promise of a second exodus; having "gathered" the "daughter of [his] dispersed ones," he is now in their midst (Zeph. 3:10, 18). The Hebrew of verse 18 is very difficult (cf. ESV mg.), resulting in manifold interpretations throughout history. The ESV translates the verse as a promise that God "will gather" his remnant exiles who have been unable to attend any festal gathering in Jerusalem and have therefore suffered reproach. Another reading interprets the verse as declaring that, at the future day of the Lord, when Jerusalem is told not to fear (v. 16), God will have already gathered his remnant to Jerusalem, overcoming their reproach and proving that his presence in their midst has secured their complete salvation. In either reading we should identify this great ingathering of the remnant (v. 18) with the promised second exodus (Isa. 11:11, 16; 49:5–6; Jer. 16:14–15; John 11:50–52), which will happen at the same time as the ingathering for global punishment (Zeph. 3:8; cf. Matt. 3:12; 13:30, 40–42; 25:32).

<span id="page-601-15"></span><span id="page-601-14"></span><span id="page-601-12"></span><span id="page-601-11"></span><span id="page-601-10"></span><span id="page-601-6"></span><span id="page-601-2"></span>3:19–20 In all likelihood, the arresting "Behold, at that time" in verse 19 returns the reader to the main voice of the prophet, with verse 18 concluding the speech begun in verse 16. "Behold" marks the significance of what follows and highlights that the book is coming to the end. Both occurrences of the phrase "at that time" in verses 19–20 refer to the day of the Lord, when God will rise as judge of the world (v. 8; cf. vv. 11, 16). "At that time" of future judgment, the Lord promises to "deal" with (i.e., eradicate) all of Jerusalem's "oppressors" (v. 19), thus reiterating that the King will remove every internal and external enemy (vv. 11, 15). With this, he will redeem the broken ("the lame") and the banished ("the outcast" in v. 19; cf. Mic. 4:6–7; Matt. 5:3–4). This restoration will fulfill his promises to replant a people for himself (Deut. 30:3–5; Isa. 11:12; Jer. 23:3) that would include engrafted members from the nations (Zeph. 3:9–10; cf. Isa. 56:8; 66:18). This great secondexodus ingathering of a worldwide remnant began in Christ's own ministry of healing (Matt. 11:5; cf. Isa. 42:3; 61:1–3) and recovery (John 10:16; 11:50–52), and the result was great praise to God.

<span id="page-601-13"></span><span id="page-601-8"></span><span id="page-601-7"></span><span id="page-601-5"></span><span id="page-601-4"></span><span id="page-601-3"></span><span id="page-601-1"></span><span id="page-601-0"></span>God "will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth" (Zeph. 3:19), and the closest parallel texts suggest this admiration and acclaim would be given not to Jerusalem's remnant but to God for his great salvation of his people. Building on his old-covenant commitment (Deut. 26:19), Yahweh declared through Jeremiah that he had set his affections on Israel and Judah "that they might be *for me* a people, a name, a praise, and a glory" (Jer. 13:11); he asserts that the future new Jerusalem "shall be *to me* a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth" (33:9). This is the Jerusalem of which Zephaniah speaks. Similarly, Ezekiel notes that in the age of the new covenant, God will display his holiness before the eyes of the nations by working deliverance on behalf of his own (Ezek. <span id="page-602-14"></span><span id="page-602-3"></span>36:23). Zechariah also envisions the remnant flock of God as "the jewels of a crown" that radiate "his goodness" and "his beauty" (Zech. 9:16–17).

<span id="page-602-13"></span><span id="page-602-7"></span><span id="page-602-6"></span><span id="page-602-5"></span><span id="page-602-0"></span>We see comparable wording in Zephaniah 3:20, although in the more personal terms used in Zephaniah's main charges in the book's body (cf. 2:1, 3; 3:8). "At that time" God will "bring" and "gather" in his remnant of faithful ones (Deut. 30:4–5) because ("for") he will display them for renown and praise "among all the peoples of the earth" (Zeph. 3:20). The divine jealousy that drives the day of the Lord (1:18; 3:8) will finally be vindicated as "all the peoples of the earth" marvel at God's majesty (cf. 2:11), now magnified in his victory over evil and his saving the righteous remnant, to whom he has restored their "fortunes" (cf. 2:7). Every eye "will behold the king in his beauty" (Isa. 33:17), not only because he will be with them (Zeph. 3:15–17) but also because he will display his great power by redeeming his people (cf. Ezek. 36:23; Zech. 14:9; 2 Thess. 1:10). These realities are already being fulfilled in the lives of every person whom God has saved (Eph. 2:8), is saving (1 Cor. 1:18), and will save (Rom. 5:9) in Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 15:10; Phil. 2:12–13; Col. 1:29).

<span id="page-602-24"></span><span id="page-602-18"></span><span id="page-602-15"></span><span id="page-602-11"></span><span id="page-602-8"></span><span id="page-602-4"></span><span id="page-602-1"></span>The book closes where it began––by identifying its contents as coming from the Lord ("says the Lord"; Zeph. 3:20; cf. 1:1). Connecting the whole book to God in this way emphasizes the seriousness of the book's commands, the certainty of its predictions, and the trustworthiness of its promises. Its readers must "seek" the Lord together (2:1, 3) and "wait" for him (3:8), relishing already the joy set before them (v. 14), for the delight and praise of the Savior (vv. 17, 19–20). Patiently pursuing the Lord together will most certainly result in prolonged pleasures in his presence, all for his glory and joy. This is the essence of the Savior's summons to satisfaction.

In the death of Christ, God reconciled us who were once his enemies, making us his friends (John 15:5; Rom. 5:10). And if God, to whom every knee will bow (Zeph. 2:11; Isa. 45:23), "is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?" (Rom. 8:31–32). "Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword" (Rom. 8:35) become instruments of grace in the hand of God, for the Lord works "all things" for the good of those who love him (v. 28), and through "all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us" (v. 37). While we still await the day when God will *fully* "deal with all [our] oppressors" (Zeph. 3:19), through the cursing of Christ (Rom. 8:3; Gal. 3:13) God has *already* disarmed the "enemies" that once stood against us (Zeph. 3:15; Col. 2:15), thus transforming even our physical death into gain (Phil. 1:21). Therefore, knowing that the Lord is with us and for

us, our souls can find rest and push ahead in hope. May we boldly and willingly proclaim the good news in the hardest places and to the most difficult peoples on the planet, hoping in our God while not fearing others. And may we increasingly flourish in holiness, confident that God is with us (Zeph. 3:15).

## <span id="page-603-6"></span>CELEBRATE JESUS AS THE HOPED-FOR SAVIOR-KING OF ISRAEL, WHOSE ARRIVAL INITIATES ZEPHANIAH'S DAY OF THE LORD

<span id="page-603-8"></span><span id="page-603-4"></span>Zephaniah portrays Yahweh as "the King of Israel" who, on the day of the Lord, will heal the disabled, gather the outcast, and deliver his remnant from evil and oppression (3:15, 17, 19)––a remnant that will include worshipers from the nations (vv. 9–10). Many of the minor prophets assert that God's future victory and peaceproducing reign will happen through a Davidic royal representative, who himself would be called "king" (e.g., Hos. 3:5; Mic. 5:2–5; Zech. 9:9).

<span id="page-603-16"></span><span id="page-603-15"></span><span id="page-603-13"></span><span id="page-603-9"></span><span id="page-603-3"></span>John identifies this "King of Israel" as Jesus (John 12:13, 15), who views himself as the ultimate temple (2:19–21; cf. 1:14) and center of people's worship (4:23) whose life-saving, disability-overcoming, and outcast-gathering ministry (5:3–9; 10:16; 11:50–51; cf. Matt. 11:5) attracts the whole world (John 12:19–21). At Jesus' triumphal entry, the crowd's cry of "Hosanna" ("Please save!"; v. 13) and Jesus' command to "fear not" (v. 15) together identify him as the One through whom God's wrath would be averted and the Evil One overcome. These remarks also clarify Jesus' emphasis later in the narrative: "Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself" (vv. 31–32).

<span id="page-603-17"></span><span id="page-603-14"></span><span id="page-603-12"></span><span id="page-603-11"></span><span id="page-603-10"></span>Jesus' death and resurrection are the initial means by which Zephaniah's "judgments" are removed and the "enemies" overcome (Zeph. 3:15). The statement regarding Jesus' being lifted up from the earth recalls John 3, where Jesus declared his coming crucifixion to be the only means for moving from death to life and being saved from God's wrath (John 3:14–17, 36). Within John's Gospel, Jesus associates his death and resurrection with the last "hour" (John 2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28; 7:30; 12:23), which is how the LXX of Daniel renders "end-of-days" language (e.g., Dan. 8:19; 12:1). From John's perspective, Jesus' first coming initiates what Zephaniah anticipated Yahweh would accomplish at the day of the Lord. We, therefore, should heed the prophet's call to "sing aloud . . . shout . . . rejoice and exult!" (Zeph. 3:14).

## <span id="page-603-5"></span><span id="page-603-2"></span>DELIGHT IN THE LORD WHO SHOWS HIS SOVEREIGN CARE FOR HIS PEOPLE BY RESCUING THEM FROM THEIR ENEMIES

<span id="page-603-7"></span><span id="page-603-1"></span><span id="page-603-0"></span>We have a God who promises to sing over those he saves (3:17; cf. Ps. 147:11), and his mirth-filled melody is to be matched, line for line, by the rejoicing of his bride in his goodness (Zeph. 3:14–15; cf. Isa. 65:18; Jer. 31:10–14). The more impressive the pardon, the more splendid the praise! "The mighty one" (Zeph. 3:17) is praiseworthy. Even more than in Zephaniah's day, we should celebrate our great Savior and the salvation he has *already* secured (vv. 14–15), knowing that doing so

<span id="page-604-10"></span><span id="page-604-9"></span><span id="page-604-8"></span><span id="page-604-7"></span><span id="page-604-6"></span><span id="page-604-5"></span><span id="page-604-4"></span><span id="page-604-3"></span><span id="page-604-2"></span><span id="page-604-1"></span><span id="page-604-0"></span>magnifies the worth and greatness of our God (vv. 19–20). Our joy today is based not on present appearances but on what God has already done and promised to do (Hab. 3:17–19; Rom. 5:2–5; 8:32). Indeed, *already* the Lord has put "everything in subjection under [Jesus'] feet" (Heb. 2:8). *Already* Christ has "disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame by triumphing over them" (Col. 2:15; cf. Zeph. 3:11, 19). *Already* "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us" (Rom. 5:5). God has *already* begun to gather his remnant (Zeph. 3:18–20; John 10:16), *already* inaugurated the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15), and *already* secured the complete and future victory for which Zephaniah rejoiced (Zeph. 3:14–15). As was true for Jesus (Isa. 53:11; Heb. 12:2), the very future joy for which we aim becomes present joy that sustains. The "mighty one" who will completely save and sing over his redeemed (Zeph. 3:17) desires to satisfy us with his goodness (vv. 14–15). Our gladness redounds to his glory (vv. 19–20), so may we today patiently pursue the Lord together in joy, embracing the Savior's summons to satisfaction.

# HAGGAI

*Michael Stead*

## <span id="page-607-2"></span>INTRODUCTION TO HAGGAI

## *Overview*

Haggai is both a challenge and an encouragement to rebuild with hope, written to a generation who had been without a temple for sixty-six years and who feared that God was no longer with them. Haggai challenged the people to commit themselves to rebuilding and promised that, if they did, God would restore the glory of the temple, blessing to his people, and the Davidic monarchy.

## *Author*

<span id="page-607-6"></span><span id="page-607-1"></span>The book records the oracles given to the prophet Haggai. Unlike with some of the other prophets, we are told little about Haggai's lineage or history. Outside this book, the only references to him occur in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14, and he is alluded to in Zechariah 8:9. These references, and the narrative of the book itself, highlight what is most important about him: he was a prophet of the Lord whose preaching led the people to turn back to the Lord and rebuild the temple.

## *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-607-5"></span><span id="page-607-3"></span>Haggai ministered in Jerusalem "in the second year of Darius" (520 BC). The oracles in the book occur within a span of four months, from the first day of the sixth month (August 29, 520 BC; cf. Hag. 1:1) to the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (December 18, 520 BC; cf. 2:20). Haggai's ministry overlaps Zechariah's (cf. dates in Zech. 1:1) and arises out of the people's failure to rebuild the temple after returning from exile. Almost two decades earlier (539 BC), Cyrus conquered Babylon and issued an edict allowing God's people to return from exile and rebuild the temple (Ezra 1). Although some work was done in the early days (cf. comment on Hag. 2:18–19), the temple was still "in ruins" in Haggai's day.

## <span id="page-607-4"></span><span id="page-607-0"></span>*Genre and Literary Structure*

The book contains oracles recording the "word of the Lord" embedded in a narrative describing the circumstances of the oracles and their impact on Haggai's audience. While we may distinguish between the oracles and the narrative (sometimes called the "editorial framework"), they are a seamless unity, each understood in relation to the other.

<span id="page-608-6"></span><span id="page-608-1"></span>There are five discrete oracles in the book, but the first two (1:2–11 and 1:13) are part of one episode, and the final two (2:10–19 and 2:20–23) came on the same day and describe the impact of laying the foundation of the temple.

## *Theology of Haggai; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ* BUILDING GOD'S "HOUSE"

<span id="page-608-2"></span><span id="page-608-0"></span>Under the old covenant, the temple was the place where the Lord "took pleasure in" sacrifices, where his "glory" dwelt among his people (cf. 1:8). Under the new covenant, the place of sacrifice and the place of God's glory are a person (Jesus), and for us to build that "house" involves building God's kingdom by bringing people to Christ and incorporating them as "living stones" into a spiritual temple (cf. 1 Pet. 2:4–6; Eph. 2:19–22). Chapter 1 of Haggai challenges us to make building God's "house" (i.e., God's kingdom) our first priority, anticipating that day when God again will dwell with his people (Rev. 21:3; 22:3–5).

## <span id="page-608-9"></span><span id="page-608-8"></span>GLORY

<span id="page-608-5"></span><span id="page-608-4"></span>The Lord promises that when the temple is built, he will fill the house with glory "in a little while" (Hag. 2:6). The place where his glory dwells must be filled by an outward manifestation of his glory, even though to Haggai's generation the temple appeared "as nothing" (2:3). Jesus is the ultimate dwelling place of God's glory (Heb. 1:3; John 1:14, 18), but that glory is not currently visible to human eyes. Haggai 2:1–9 encourages us to look beyond what we can see and persevere in God's work, because that glory now hidden will be revealed "in a little while."

## <span id="page-608-7"></span><span id="page-608-3"></span>FOUNDATION

Even before the temple is completed, God is present with his people. The turning point is the day the foundation of the temple is laid. This day leads to an immediate reversal of fortune, from defilement and "curses" to favor and blessing, to the promise of a reversal of fortune for the kingdom and throne of David. *Our* "foundation day" occurred in the death and resurrection of Christ. Because of what Jesus has done, we are no longer in that hopeless situation of impure worshipers offering unclean sacrifices unacceptable to God. We have *already* transitioned from "curse" to "blessing," and the "foundation" already laid by Christ is the sign and guarantee of the future coming of the kingdom and throne of the Son of David.

## *Preaching from Haggai*

Haggai can be challenging to preach from because most Christians are unfamiliar with the early postexilic period. This challenge is compounded by how Haggai addresses matters seemingly irrelevant to Christians, such as the temple, ritual purity, and the ongoing significance of Zerubbabel. Preaching from Haggai needs to be grounded in the book's historical context and shaped by a biblical theology that demonstrates how the theological themes of the book find their fulfillment in Christ.

<span id="page-609-2"></span><span id="page-609-0"></span>Haggai is best preached in three sections: 1:1–15; 2:1–9; and 2:10–23; taking 2:10–19 and 2:20–23 as a single unit describing both the immediate (vv. 10–19) and the ultimate (vv. 20–23) implications of laying the foundations of the Lord's temple.

<span id="page-609-3"></span><span id="page-609-1"></span>Several themes recur across the book. For example, the people's repentance is addressed in 1:12 and 2:17, and blessing/cursing is addressed in 1:9–11 and 2:15–17. To prevent repetitive sermons, it is important to decide which sermon should highlight a particular theme.

<span id="page-610-0"></span>1In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: **<sup>2</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord." **3**Then the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, **<sup>4</sup>** "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? **5**Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. **6**You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.

**<sup>7</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. **8**Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the Lord. **9**You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. **10**Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. **<sup>11</sup>**And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors."

**12**Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord. **13**Then Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke to the people with the Lord's message, "I am with you, declares the Lord." **14**And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God, **<sup>15</sup>** on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-610-1"></span>Haggai's first oracle came in 520 BC—sixty-six years after the destruction of the temple and almost two decades after Cyrus conquered Babylon and allowed God's people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. However, despite their return, the temple was still "in ruins" (1:4) because the people had been telling themselves that the "time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord" (v. 2). Haggai challenged the people to reassess their ways and give priority to rebuilding the temple.

<span id="page-611-6"></span><span id="page-611-4"></span><span id="page-611-0"></span>Their current ways had led to poor harvests because of God's covenant curses. This point is emphasized by a fourfold echo of curses from Deuteronomy 11 and 28 in Haggai 1:6, 10–11. They have experienced these curses because "My house . . . lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house" (v. 9). The Lord's house had dual functions—the place of sacrifice for sin, and the dwelling of God's glory (v. 8). Their neglect of the temple over the past two decades demonstrated indifference to the Lord's dwelling and their own sin. By pursuing their own needs first, the people had failed to live as the covenant people of God, and so the Lord withheld covenant blessings.

<span id="page-611-5"></span>Through the work of the Spirit, Haggai's first sermon was effective. The people "obeyed the voice of the Lord their God" and "feared the Lord" (v. 12). In response to their repentance, the Lord declared, "I am with you" (v. 13), to reassure them that he was no longer against them or absent from them. Encouraged by these words, the people were stirred to action and began work on the temple.

### <span id="page-611-8"></span><span id="page-611-7"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-611-1"></span>1:1 Haggai's first oracle is dated precisely: "the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month" (August 29, 520 BC). Darius I ruled the Persian Empire from 522 to 486 BC. That Haggai dates the oracle with reference to a pagan king highlights the continuing absence of a Davidic king in Jerusalem. This oracle is addressed to two named individuals. The first is "Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah." Shealtiel was the son of Jehoiachin, the Davidic king at the time of exile (cf. 1 Chron. 3:17). As a grandson of Jehoiachin, Zerubbabel was potentially the heir to the Davidic throne. Furthermore, he was the Persian-appointed governor of Judah. The second addressee is "Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest." Jehozadak was high priest at the time of the exile

<span id="page-612-11"></span><span id="page-612-2"></span>(cf. 1 Chron. 6:15), and his son Joshua now filled that role in the postexilic community. This oracle is therefore addressed to the civic and religious leaders of the day, and through them to the community as a whole (cf. Hag. 1:12, where all three parties—Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people—are explicitly named).

<span id="page-612-4"></span>1:2 This oracle begins with a typical formula: "Thus says the Lord of hosts." What follows, however, is atypical: the Lord speaks not his own words but what the people have been saying—that the "time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord." The temple was destroyed in 586 BC by the army of Nebuchadnezzar. It represented God's dwelling place with his people and was where sacrifices were offered to remove the guilt of sin. At the time of this oracle, the people of God had been without the place of sacrifice and God's dwelling for sixty-six years.

The reason for saying "the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord" is not given. Perhaps the people believed their current circumstances were a sign of still being under the curse of God because their "seventy years" of judgment had not yet ended (cf. Jer. 25:11; Zech. 1:12). Perhaps they did not want to be like King David, who, seeing his own house of cedar, presumed to take the initiative to build a house for the Lord before being told to do so (cf. 2 Samuel 7). Or perhaps it was simply pragmatism. In circumstances where resources were scarce (cf. comment on Hag. 1:5–8), were they simply giving priority to their own material needs? On whatever basis the people might have justified not rebuilding the temple, it is clear from what follows in Haggai 1:4–7 that these were nothing more than excuses to devote themselves to their own prosperity.

<span id="page-612-8"></span><span id="page-612-6"></span><span id="page-612-5"></span><span id="page-612-3"></span>1:3–4 The Lord's response to their procrastination is introduced by the same "messenger" formula as verse 1. Through Haggai he asks, "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?" The people had claimed that "the time has not yet come," but they evidently had enough "time" to build their own paneled houses. They had forsaken work on God's dwelling place to work on their own dwellings. Whatever justification the people relied on for not beginning work on the temple, this rhetorical question exposes their core problem: prioritizing self-interest ahead of God's purposes.

<span id="page-612-9"></span><span id="page-612-7"></span>1:5–8 In these verses the people are told twice to "consider your ways" (vv. 5, 7). First, they should consider their current "ways" and the resulting scarcity (v. 6). The second instruction to "consider your ways" (v. 7) offers a very different alternative.

<span id="page-612-10"></span><span id="page-612-1"></span><span id="page-612-0"></span>Their current ways—prioritizing their own prosperity—has, ironically, led to the opposite outcome. Their agricultural endeavors have produced only meager returns—they have "sown much and harvested little." This description echoes the curse pronounced in Deuteronomy 28:38, inviting the conclusion that their agricultural problems are God's curse for disobeying the covenant. The next clause again echoes Deuteronomy to make the same point in reverse—to "eat and be full" is a sign of God's blessing (cf. Deut. 11:15), so to eat but never have enough implies a curse. With respect to the necessities of life—food, drink, clothing—the <span id="page-613-4"></span>people experience scarcity instead of abundance. Haggai 1:6 ends with a picture summarizing the futility of their present ways: working for wages that go into a bag that cannot hold them.

<span id="page-613-5"></span>In light of the futility of their present ways, the people are again directed in verse 7 to "consider your ways" and walk differently in the future: "Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house." Instead of gathering wood to panel their own houses, they should gather wood for the construction of the Lord's house. The reason given for building the temple was perhaps not what Haggai's audience expected, based on the implications of verse 6. Having seen how their current behavior had led to curse conditions, they might have expected a promise of blessing. Instead the Lord says they should build the house "that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified." The reason for building the temple is not for their own blessing but for God's pleasure and glory.

<span id="page-613-3"></span><span id="page-613-1"></span>These dual reasons for rebuilding—God's pleasure and glory—point to the twin functions of the temple. The verb translated "take pleasure" is typically associated with sacrifices acceptable to the Lord, in which he "takes pleasure." Prior to Haggai, the last word the people had heard from the Lord's prophets was that he "took no pleasure" in sacrifices offered at the temple (e.g., Jer. 14:12; Hos. 8:13; Amos 5:22). Haggai 1:8 offers the possibility of reversal: the Lord will again "take pleasure" in sacrifices offered at the temple. The phrase "in it" denotes the *location* where the Lord will take pleasure (i.e., in the temple), not the *object* of his pleasure. There is a similar possibility of reversal with respect to "glory." The temple was where the glory of the Lord dwelt amid his people (cf. 1 Kings 8:11; Ps. 26:8). However, the last word prior to Haggai was that the Lord's glory had departed the temple (Ezek. 10:18). By rebuilding the temple, the people could restore it both to where God takes pleasure in sacrifice and where he dwells in glory amid his people. Conversely, their neglect of the temple over the past two decades demonstrated their indifference to the Lord's dwelling among them and to the issue of whether or not their sin offerings were acceptable.

<span id="page-613-7"></span><span id="page-613-2"></span><span id="page-613-0"></span>1:9–11 What was implicit in verse 6 is now made explicit: the people "looked for much," but "it came to little" because they were experiencing the Lord's judgment. The Lord himself "blew away" their produce (presumably a reference to dry conditions) "because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house." There is wordplay in Hebrew between the words for "ruins" in verse 9 (*khareb*) and "drought" in verse 11 (*khoreb*); because they left his house in ruins, the Lord ruined their crops. They had neglected God's house because each person was (lit.) "rushing to his own house," i.e., seeking his own interests.

<span id="page-613-6"></span>Because of this, the Lord brought scarcity upon them. As in verse 6, this point is brought home by a double echo of covenant curses from Deuteronomy 11 and 28. Their recent experience—"The heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce"—is a covenant curse of Deuteronomy 11:17. Similarly, their "drought . . . on the grain, the new wine, the oil" and on "man and

<span id="page-614-5"></span>beast" reflects the destruction promised in Deuteronomy 28:51 for those who disobey the covenant. This fourfold repetition of covenant curses points to the magnitude of the error of Haggai's generation. It is not merely a case of misplaced priorities. Rather, by pursuing their own houses, they have forsaken God's covenant. Their failure is described in Deuteronomy 28: they have failed to "faithfully obey the voice of the Lord" (Deut. 28:1) or to "serve the Lord . . . with joyfulness and gladness of heart" (Deut. 28:47). They have been disobedient and self-serving.

<span id="page-614-6"></span><span id="page-614-4"></span><span id="page-614-3"></span><span id="page-614-2"></span>1:12 This verse narrates the response of the community to the challenge of verses 2–11. The initial oracle about "these people" in verse 2 was addressed only to Zerubbabel and Joshua, but now the people are included explicitly,1 and a change in description reflects a change in their relationship with God: "these people" have become "the remnant of the people." The "remnant" describes those left after a time of judgment to become the focus of God's ongoing purposes for his people. Their status has changed because of a twofold response. First, the whole community "obeyed the voice of the Lord their God" (cf. Deut. 28:1, quoted above). They heard this "voice" through Haggai the prophet, whom they accepted as one sent by the Lord. Second, the people "feared the Lord." To fear the Lord does not mean to be terrified of him, but to give him the wholehearted reverence and respect he deserves as the one and only Lord (Deut. 6:12–15). Fearing the Lord and obeying his commands are how the covenant people of God should respond to him (e.g., Deut. 6:24; 10:12; 31:12). Through the preaching of Haggai, the Lord reorients the hearts of the people, who turn from indifference and disobedience to reverence and obedience. This change of heart leads to changed behavior.

<span id="page-614-10"></span><span id="page-614-9"></span><span id="page-614-1"></span><span id="page-614-0"></span>1:13 Because of the people's repentance as described in verse 12, the Lord speaks his next oracle through Haggai to the people. It is a very short oracle—two words in Hebrew, four in English—"I am with you." Yet we should not underestimate the weight of this tiny oracle. The failed crops seemed to say, "The Lord is against us," and the ruined temple seemed to say, "The Lord is absent from us." But the Lord assures them that he is with them; this is an oracle of reassurance and hope. Notwithstanding that the dwelling again of God's glory in the temple was still future (cf. comment on 1:5–8), this oracle declares that the Lord has already returned to his people and is with them. The same promise is repeated in 2:4, with a further word of explanation in the following verse: "My Spirit remains in your midst" (2:5).

<span id="page-614-13"></span><span id="page-614-12"></span><span id="page-614-11"></span><span id="page-614-8"></span>1:14 Having stirred the hearts of the leaders and people to repentance (v. 12), and having given them a word of encouragement and hope (v. 13), the Lord stirs them to action. Almost twenty years earlier, the Lord had begun the work of restoring Jerusalem by "stirring up the spirit" of Cyrus to allow the temple to be rebuilt and "stirring up the spirit" of the exiles to return and build the house of

<span id="page-614-7"></span><sup>1</sup> The oracles in verses 4ff. are implicitly addressed to the people—they are the "you" who dwell in paneled houses.

<span id="page-615-5"></span><span id="page-615-0"></span>the Lord (Ezra 1:1, 5). Now is another crucial moment of "stirr[ing] up the spirit" of Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people. As a result, they "came and worked on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God." The Lord is identified for the first time as "their God" in Hag. 1:12—because they obeyed the voice of "the Lord their God," they now desire to build the house of "the Lord their God" (v. 14). This phrase reflects the covenant formula—"I will be their God" (cf. Jer. 31:33). The people's response of obedience reflects their restored covenant relationship with God.

<span id="page-615-6"></span><span id="page-615-1"></span>1:15 The people begin work on the temple on the 24th day of the sixth month, 23 days after Haggai's first oracle. This date bookends the date in verse 1 and completes the first unit of Haggai, utilizing the same elements as verse 1 (year-monthday) but in reverse order (day-month-year). This literary reversal complements the theme of the chapter: the reversal of the people's hearts.

## *Response*

Haggai's first chapter called on its original audience to devote themselves to rebuilding the temple. We trivialize this passage by applying it to our own church building projects—the temple had a special significance in the old covenant as the place where the Lord "takes pleasure in" sacrifices and where his "glory" dwells among his people (cf. v. 8).

<span id="page-615-3"></span>Under the new covenant, the place of sacrifice and God's glory is now located in a person. Jesus' once-for-all sacrifice on the cross is the only sacrifice for sin that God takes pleasure in. Likewise, Jesus himself is the ultimate dwelling place of God's glory (John 1:14). Therefore, for us to "build the house of the Lord" does not require going to the hills for wood. Instead, it involves building a "spiritual house" by bringing people to Christ, who incorporates them as "living stones" into a new temple, built on his cornerstone. This is our "spiritual sacrifice[s] acceptable to God" (1 Pet. 2:4–6). While Haggai, in chapter 1, told his original audience to "Build God's house," to us he says, "Build God's kingdom."

<span id="page-615-10"></span><span id="page-615-9"></span><span id="page-615-8"></span><span id="page-615-7"></span><span id="page-615-4"></span><span id="page-615-2"></span>Haggai's generation prioritized the comforts of their own homes over the house of the Lord. Their problem was much deeper than misaligned priorities. Faced with material scarcity, they put all their efforts into laying up for themselves treasures on earth (Matt. 6:19), and for almost twenty years they had put little effort into enabling God's presence or seeking his pleasure. Instead of serving the Lord, they were serving themselves. The people did what Jesus says not to do: be overcome by anxieties about food and drink and clothing. In Matthew 6:32, Jesus warns us not to be like the "Gentiles [who] seek after all these things" (or like the people in Haggai 1:9, "each rushing to his own house" [AT]) in making comfort and security our first priority. Just as Haggai 1 called that generation to reconsider their ways, so it calls us not to prioritize our own material security (our "treasures here on earth"), but instead to fear the Lord and walk in trust and obedience to his Word. We should "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you" (Matt. 6:33).

<span id="page-616-0"></span>The final part of Jesus' promise—"all these things will be added to you"—provides a helpful perspective on the issue of material need and blessing today. Passages such as Haggai 1 are sometimes misapplied, as though they guarantee material blessing to the NT believer who puts God's kingdom as his first priority (in its most crude form, "If you give to God's work, he will give back blessings in abundance").

This misapplies Haggai 1. Haggai's generation should do the Lord's work not so that he will bless them but so that he may again "take pleasure in" their sacrifices and be glorified. That is, the motivation is focused on God, not self. A motivation that at its core seeks blessings for self is not first seeking God's kingdom. There is a further reason we cannot take the OT promises of material blessing and automatically apply them to ourselves: The material blessings of the old covenant were linked to inheritance in the Promised Land. The new covenant believer will receive material blessings from the Lord, but we must wait for them till the new creation (Matt. 25:34; Rev. 22:1–3). If we receive material abundance from the Lord in this present life, it is not necessarily because God has blessed our covenant obedience. It is a gracious gift from the hand of God (and, as a gift, it is to be shared with others).

<span id="page-616-2"></span>Haggai confronted his generation by telling them they experienced covenant curses because of forsaking the Lord, and they repented. They feared (revered) the Lord and responded in obedience to his voice. As a result, God declared, "I am with you," and, believing that promise, the people began the work on God's house, even though their material situation had not changed. How will we respond to the challenge to build God's kingdom? Will we say, "Now is not the right time"? Haggai 1 says to us, "Now *is* the time." It calls us to commit ourselves to "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness"—to make this our first priority, not what we do with the leftovers of our time or resources. And if we, perhaps like Haggai's generation, are anxious that devoting our best endeavors and firstfruits to the Lord will leave us short, we must trust in the words of Jesus: "Your heavenly Father knows that you need [these necessities of life]. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you" (Matt. 6:31–33).

## HAGGAI 2:1–9

<span id="page-616-1"></span>2In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet: **<sup>2</sup>** "Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say, **<sup>3</sup>** 'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? **4**Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the Lord. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the Lord.

Work, for I am with you, declares the Lord of hosts, **<sup>5</sup>** according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not. **6**For thus says the Lord of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land. **7**And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts. **8**The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the Lord of hosts. **9**The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the Lord of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the Lord of hosts.' "

## *Section Overview*

Less than a month after the people began work on the temple, disillusionment began to creep in. Some people were old enough to remember the "former glory" of the temple, and the pitiful ruins before them now seemed "as nothing in [their] eyes" (2:3). This oracle speaks a word of hope to encourage the builders to be strong, do the work, and not be afraid.

<span id="page-617-4"></span>The basis for this encouragement is that the Lord is now present with them by his Spirit, as he was when he established the nation through covenant at Sinai. In the same way that he shook the nation of Egypt, he will again shake the nations and cause their treasure to come in. As a result, he will fill his house with glory. The place where his glory will again dwell among his people will be matched by a manifestation of glory exceeding the glory of Solomon's temple and its splendor. This will happen "in a little while."

This was the seventh day of the Feast of Booths, an annual festival at the end of harvest season thanking God for the harvest (Lev. 23:34–43; Deut. 16:13–17). According to Haggai 1:9–11 and 2:15–18, the harvest that year was poor, which sets the scene for this oracle, in which the Lord responds to the people's deeper disappointment with the temple. Furthermore, the Feast of Booths marked the anniversary of Solomon's dedication of the temple (1 Kings 8:1), another poignant reminder of their current disappointment.

<span id="page-618-8"></span><span id="page-618-7"></span><span id="page-618-3"></span><span id="page-618-2"></span>2:2–3 Similar to the first oracle, the Lord begins this oracle by critiquing the attitude of the people—the temple is "as nothing" in their eyes. The three addressees of this oracle are the same as in 1:12, 14—the same people who had responded rightly by obeying and fearing the Lord, and whose spirits the Lord had "stirred up" to work on the temple, are now dispirited by the task ahead of them. This was not without cause. There were evidently some among the group who had seen "this house in its former glory." Solomon's temple required a workforce of more than 180,000 men (1 Kings 5:3–16), and even with so many workers it took seven years to complete. Its construction involved more than 285 tons of gold, 625 tons of silver, and bronze beyond measure (1 Kings 7:47; 1 Chron. 29:3–7). Even though the temple was plundered by various conquering nations over the centuries, it was still an impressively "glorious" structure until its destruction in 586 BC. By comparison, what Haggai's contemporaries saw before them was indeed "as nothing."2 The temple was "in ruins" (Hag. 1:4); although they had begun work three weeks earlier, it was apparently only preparatory work, as they had not yet laid the foundation or put stone upon stone (cf. 2:15, 18). Not only was the house now "as nothing"; what they could hope to achieve would be "as nothing" by comparison, given they had only a tiny fraction of the workforce and resources that Solomon had.

<span id="page-618-11"></span><span id="page-618-9"></span><span id="page-618-6"></span><span id="page-618-4"></span>2:4–5 In the face of a seemingly insurmountable task, the Lord gives three commands to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people (now identified as "all you people of the land"): "be strong," "work," and "fear not." David gave similar instructions to Solomon: "Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the Lord God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the Lord is finished" (1 Chron. 28:20). Haggai's audience is given the same assurance of God's ongoing presence as they build the temple: "I am with you, declares the Lord of hosts" (Hag. 2:8). The source of God's presence is explained in verse 5: "My Spirit remains in your midst." Although it is the completion of the temple that will bring about the dwelling of God's glory in their midst, even now the Lord is present with them by his Spirit. Verse 5 says literally the Spirit is "standing" (Hb. *ʻamad* ) in their midst, in the same way the "pillar (*ʻammud* ) of cloud [was] standing (*ʻamad* ) at the entrance of the tent [of meeting]" (Ex. 33:10). Exodus 33 occurs before there was tabernacle or temple, and notwithstanding the absence of a temple, God's presence had been "standing" in their midst. It is the same now. They can be confident that God is indeed with them because of his covenant with them, described by the Lord as the "covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt" (Hag. 2:5).

<span id="page-618-10"></span><span id="page-618-1"></span><span id="page-618-0"></span>2:6–8 When God made his covenant with Israel at Sinai, the whole mountain trembled at his presence (Ex. 19:18). Psalm 68:7–18 describes how this trembling reverberated through the centuries, summarizing how the Lord led his people

<span id="page-618-5"></span><sup>2</sup> See similarly Ezra 3:10–13, which describes how those who had seen the former temple were weeping on the day the new foundations of the temple were laid.

<span id="page-619-11"></span><span id="page-619-8"></span><span id="page-619-5"></span><span id="page-619-2"></span>from Sinai to his sanctuary—the Lord marched and the earth shook (vv. 7–8). He scattered the nations in Israel's path, and Israel gathered their gold and silver in plunder (vv. 12–14) to adorn the Lord's dwelling place at Jerusalem (vv. 15–18). Israel's history began with cosmic upheaval — a shaking of heaven and earth, resulting in a shaking of the nations so that their plunder could glorify the house of the Lord. Israel's prophets had promised a coming day when the Lord would again shake things up (Ezek. 38:19–23; Joel 3:15–17). According to Haggai 2:6–7, the Lord is about to do again what he did at Sinai: "Once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth." This will be a final shaking, which will occur "in a little while." This shaking is "so that the treasures of all nations shall come in"3 and the Lord himself will "fill this house with glory." As in verse 3, "glory" here refers to the material splendor of the temple, as in the "gold" and "silver" of verse 8. However, there is a double sense in which the Lord will "fill this house with glory." Elsewhere, when the Lord "fills" the tabernacle/temple with glory, it is a manifestation of his presence (cf. Ex. 40:34; 1 Kings 8:11; Ezek. 43:5). The echoing of that language here is a reminder that the outward glory of the temple is a reflection of the Glorious One dwelling within. This promise reassures the people that this temple — as unimpressive as it looks at the moment — will again become the dwelling place for God's glory. They need not concern themselves with their lack of resources, for the Lord himself will provide what they need from his abundance. The Lord will "shake the nations" until all *his* gold and silver falls from their pockets, and he will use that treasure to glorify his house.

<span id="page-619-10"></span><span id="page-619-9"></span><span id="page-619-6"></span><span id="page-619-4"></span><span id="page-619-3"></span><span id="page-619-0"></span>2:9 The oracle ends with the promise that the "latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former." Given the physical grandeur of Solomon's temple, this promise must have astounded Haggai's audience. It will be greater because of the universal scope of its impact—the Lord will shake "*all* nations" and bring "treasures of *all* nations" (v. 7). Coupled with this promise of greater glory is a promise of peace. Just as the Lord gave peace to Israel when the first temple was built (1 Chron. 22:8–10), now also the Lord declares, "In this place I will give peace." The greatness of Solomon's temple will be surpassed by the one yet to come, and therefore Haggai's generation must not give up hope or become dispirited by looking back to the glory of the past; they must look instead to the glory of the future.

#### <span id="page-619-1"></span>*Response*

This oracle is an encouragement to Haggai's generation to persevere in the work of temple building because of the glory ultimately to be revealed. Whereas the appropriate response for the original hearers involved building the physical temple (as in ch. 1), for us the appropriate response involves building God's kingdom.

<span id="page-619-7"></span><sup>3</sup> The KJV translation, "the desire of all nations shall come," takes the word for "treasures" as singular, resulting in a messianic understanding of this verse—reflected, e.g., in Wesley's lyrics "Come, Desire of nations, come! Fix in us Thy humble home." However, both the grammar (the verb "come" is plural) and the context ("treasures" in v. 7 is parallel to "gold" and "silver" in v. 8) indicate the plural "treasures" is the better translation.

The work of building God's kingdom can often seem "as nothing" in our eyes. Periods of difficult and apparently unfruitful ministry might cause those with long memories to hark back to the "glory days" of old, de-energizing ministry in the present.

<span id="page-620-9"></span><span id="page-620-7"></span><span id="page-620-5"></span><span id="page-620-4"></span><span id="page-620-3"></span>This oracle reminds us that the glory of God's work is not always manifest, at least not initially. For Haggai's generation, the pathetic ruins before them bore none of the manifestations of glory. And yet, as they persevered in rebuilding the temple, God would return to dwell there among his people (cf. Zech. 2:5; 8:3). And, once God's glory dwells in the temple, there must inevitably be an outward manifestation of that glory. But, as this oracle reminds us, there can be a gap—a "little while"—until we see that outward manifestation. We find this in the life and ministry of Jesus. Jesus is the "radiance of the glory of God" (Heb. 1:3), in whom the full glory of God is manifest (John 1:14, 18). However, apart from momentary glimpses like his transfiguration (Matt. 17:1–8), people did not perceive this glory. Indeed, at the hour when Jesus was "glorified" (John 17:1–5), he appeared anything but glorious. As we see Christ on the cross, we don't see "glory"; all we see is shame and suffering—it looks "as nothing" in our eyes. Yet, because of that shame-filled death on the cross, he was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). Although Jesus has already been glorified, we still await the day of the "appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ" (Titus 2:13), when his kingdom will be manifest for all to see. Hebrews 12:18–29 tells us this final day will be the ultimate fulfillment of Haggai 2:6, when the Lord will once more shake all things so that what remains will be a kingdom that cannot be shaken. On that day, the glory of God's "dwelling place" among us will indeed exceed the "former glory" (Rev. 21:1–3, 10–23). Indeed, "the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it" (Rev. 21:24).

<span id="page-620-15"></span><span id="page-620-14"></span><span id="page-620-13"></span><span id="page-620-12"></span><span id="page-620-10"></span><span id="page-620-8"></span><span id="page-620-2"></span>That the fulfillment of Haggai 2:1–9 is still to come means the "little while" of verse 6 has stretched thousands of years. This ought not surprise us, given that "With the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (2 Pet. 3:8). Like Haggai's generation, we too need to persevere in hope, waiting for the day when the glory of Christ's kingdom will be fully manifest. As Hebrews 10:37 reminds us, it is only "yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay." Until then, we must respond as Haggai's generation was exhorted: fear not, be strong, and keep doing the work of building God's kingdom, boldly proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ to all nations.

<span id="page-620-11"></span><span id="page-620-6"></span><span id="page-620-1"></span><span id="page-620-0"></span>We persevere in the knowledge that God is with us; his Spirit remains in our midst (Hag. 2:5). Haggai's generation knew this because of the promises of the Sinai covenant. This verse takes on special significance for us because of the promise of the new covenant. In the time of the old covenant, God's Spirit could be *with* his people, but since the dawning of the new covenant God's Spirit is *in* us, indwelling each believer personally (John 14:17), because God himself pours his Spirit into our hearts (Jer. 31:31–33; Ezek. 36:26–27; Joel 2:28). It is by the indwelling Spirit that both Father and Son come and make their "home" ("dwelling place")

<span id="page-621-1"></span>in the believer (John 14:23). Because of this, what Haggai 2:1–9 tells us about building the house of the Lord applies not only to Jesus (as the ultimate dwelling place) and to the heavenly Jerusalem (as the final dwelling place) but also to each believer, who is God's dwelling-place under construction, a "temple of the Holy Spirit within you" (1 Cor. 6:19).

<span id="page-621-6"></span><span id="page-621-5"></span><span id="page-621-4"></span><span id="page-621-3"></span>In the same way that the glory of Jesus and his coming kingdom remains partially hidden from our eyes, so also his glory in us is somewhat obscured. Although we are those who "behold the glory of the Lord" and are "being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another" (2 Cor. 3:18), and although God has shone his glorious light "in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God" (2 Cor. 4:6), nevertheless, "We have this treasure in jars of clay" (4:7). In our eyes, God's work in us (e.g., sanctification) and through us (e.g., evangelism) does not always look "glorious"—at times it may appear as nothing. We must look beyond our present circumstances to see what God is going to do "in a little while." Like Paul, we need to remember that our "light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison" (4:17)—a final glory that will far outstrip any "former glory."

<span id="page-621-7"></span><span id="page-621-2"></span><span id="page-621-0"></span>In response we need to fear not, be strong, and persevere in God's work, knowing that this work—despite all appearances—is glorious, and that one day the glory presently hidden in weak and fragile jars of clay will be fully revealed to the whole creation (Rom. 8:18).

## HAGGAI 2:10–23

**<sup>10</sup>**On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, **<sup>11</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests about the law: **<sup>12</sup>** 'If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food, does it become holy?' " The priests answered and said, "No." **13**Then Haggai said, "If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?" The priests answered and said, "It does become unclean." **<sup>14</sup>**Then Haggai answered and said, "So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, declares the Lord, and so with every work of their hands. And what they offer there is unclean. **15**Now then, consider from this day onward.*<sup>1</sup>* Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the Lord, **16**how did you fare? When*<sup>2</sup>* one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty. **<sup>17</sup>** I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail, yet you did not turn to me, declares the Lord. **18**Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the Lord's

temple was laid, consider: **<sup>19</sup>** Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing. But from this day on I will bless you."

**20**The word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twentyfourth day of the month, **<sup>21</sup>** "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth, **<sup>22</sup>** and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall go down, every one by the sword of his brother. **23**On that day, declares the Lord of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel, declares the Lord, and make you like a*<sup>3</sup>* signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the Lord of hosts."

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-622-0"></span>Although 2:10–19 and 2:20–23 are formally two distinct oracles, they should be understood as a coordinated unit describing the immediate (vv. 10–19) and ultimate (vv. 20–23) outcomes of the foundation of the Lord's temple. Restoring the foundation of the temple restores the foundation of the relationship between God and his people. Verses 10–19 explain that, because of what has happened "on *this* day," cursing has turned into blessing as the people have returned to the Lord. Previously, the contamination of sin meant the works of their hands were blighted and their work on the temple was "unclean" in God's sight. But from "foundation day" onward, the Lord has blessed them. Verses 20–23 describe what will happen on a future day ("on *that* day"; v. 23) when God will restore "kingdom" and "kingship" to his people, giving a sign of that restoration by reinstating Zerubbabel as a "signet ring" (v. 23). This pair of oracles highlights the connection between the reestablishment of the temple, the covenant relationship between God and his people, and the restoration of the Davidic kingship.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-623-8"></span>2:10 The date of both oracles in this section is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius (December 18, 520 BC). This pivotal date was the day the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. This date is exactly three months after the people began work on the temple (1:15) and two months after Haggai encouraged them to be strong and persevere in that work (2:4).

<span id="page-623-9"></span><span id="page-623-7"></span><span id="page-623-6"></span>2:11 The oracles thus far have been explicitly addressed to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and (usually) the people. Here the addressees are not named at the outset, although it becomes clear that all the people are being addressed (cf. comment on 2:14). This oracle begins with the Lord directing Haggai to ask the priests for a ruling from the law—these priests had a responsibility to provide instruction based on God's law (Lev. 10:10–11; Deut. 17:9–11; Ezek. 44:23)

<span id="page-623-10"></span><span id="page-623-2"></span><span id="page-623-1"></span><span id="page-623-0"></span>2:12–13 The priests are asked for two rulings about the transmission of holiness and uncleanness. The first scenario involves "holy meat" carried in the fold of a garment. In view are the peace offerings (thanksgiving, vow, and freewill offerings) described in Leviticus 7:14–20, the meat of which could be taken home by the worshiper to be consumed. According to Leviticus 6:25–27, the meat of a sacrifice offered to the Lord became holy, and whatever touched the meat (such as a garment) also became holy. The issue in this first scenario is whether the garment made holy by direct touch can pass that holiness to other objects that subsequently come into contact with the garment. The priests say no: holiness cannot be transmitted to the third degree. The second scenario involves someone who has become unclean by contact with a dead body (cf. Num. 19:11), and whether this defilement could be further transmitted by touch. The priests' answer accords with Numbers 19:22: "Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening." The priests' rulings demonstrate that defilement can be transmitted by indirect contact to the third degree (and beyond), but holiness cannot be. Defilement is more contagious than holiness.

<span id="page-623-11"></span><span id="page-623-5"></span><span id="page-623-4"></span><span id="page-623-3"></span>2:14 The principles of these rulings are now applied by analogy to "this people" and "this nation." The Lord declares that "every work of their hands" and "what they offer there" is unclean. "Every work of their hands" includes both their work on the temple and the agricultural produce they offer there. There is no antecedent for the word "there," but we know from Ezra 3:1–2 that an altar for sacrifices was reestablished in Jerusalem after the return from Babylon, and this is presumably where the people were presenting their sacrifices and offerings. However, their sacrifices and offerings are unacceptable to the Lord because the people themselves are unclean, and the implication of the priest's second ruling is that the defilement of the people is transmitted to their gifts by direct contact. Furthermore, their work in building the temple is also tainted. The temple was to be the place where the contamination of sin was removed, but if the temple itself was contaminated, the people were in a hopeless situation. There is no way unclean offerings offered

<span id="page-624-8"></span><span id="page-624-1"></span>in an unclean temple could cleanse an unclean people. The Lord does not "take pleasure" in such sacrifices (cf. comment on Hag. 1:5–8). "This people" and "this nation" are used here in parallel to describe the same group (cf. Ex. 33:13; Deut. 4:6; 2 Sam. 7:23; Isa. 1:4; Jer. 33:24).

<span id="page-624-12"></span><span id="page-624-6"></span><span id="page-624-2"></span>2:15–17 As Psalm 24:3–5 tells us, only those with "clean hands and a pure heart" may stand in God's holy place: such a person "will receive blessing from the Lord." The experience of Haggai's audience was the corollary of this. Their unclean hands had offered unacceptable sacrifices, and instead of blessings they experienced curses. The people are invited to consider, "How did you fare?" Where they expected twenty measures of grain, only ten were found, and where there should have been fifty measures of wine, only twenty were found. This diminished yield was not the result of human mismanagement but was because the Lord had "struck" them with covenant curses of blight and mildew (cf. Deut. 28:22), compounded by destructive hail (cf. Ex. 9:18–26). The purpose of these curses was so that the people would turn to the Lord (cf. Amos 4:9), but they had not done so.

<span id="page-624-9"></span><span id="page-624-7"></span><span id="page-624-3"></span><span id="page-624-0"></span>Even though, according to Haggai 1:12–14, the people began "obeying" and "fearing" the Lord in the sixth month (leading to the commencement of work on the house of the Lord), something was evidently still lacking in their "turning back" to the Lord. The prophet Zechariah, prophesying in the eighth month of the same year, began his prophetic ministry with a call to repentance: "Return to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will return to you" (Zech. 1:3). It was in response to the combined prophetic ministry of Haggai and Zechariah that the people did "return to the Lord" (cf. Ezra 5:1), and this repentance is demonstrated particularly by their committing themselves to the reconstruction of the temple.

<span id="page-624-17"></span><span id="page-624-11"></span><span id="page-624-4"></span>The critical turning point is the day when the "stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the Lord" (Hag. 2:15). Prior to this, the building has been described by Haggai as the "house" of the Lord. From this point onward it is called the "temple."

<span id="page-624-15"></span><span id="page-624-14"></span><span id="page-624-10"></span>2:18–19 The significance of this day is highlighted by a threefold reiteration in verse 18: the command to "consider from this day onward" (repeating v. 15); the date (the 24th day of the ninth month, mostly echoing v. 10); and the reference to temple-building (cf. v. 15). This repetition underscores the significance of laying the foundation of the Lord's temple. Some work had apparently been done on the temple site by the first wave of returnees (c. 537 BC) under Sheshbazzar (cf. Ezra 5:16). But it is this current work in the ninth month of the second year of Darius, under the leadership of Joshua and Zerubbabel, that establishes the temple foundations.

<span id="page-624-16"></span><span id="page-624-13"></span><span id="page-624-5"></span>The Lord promises (Hag. 2:19) that this day will mark a turnaround in the agricultural prosperity of the community. That year's grain crop (harvested in May/ June) was meager (v. 16). From that poor harvest, the next season's crop would have been sown in October and November, after the early rains had softened the ground. Thus, at the date of this oracle (December 18), the seed is in the ground. The answer to the rhetorical question "Is the seed yet in the barn?" is no: it is in the ground.

<span id="page-625-9"></span>The community has very little to live on. It is similar with the produce from their orchards. The harvest from the "vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive" has been collected, and the situation is grim—they "have yielded nothing." But the people are given divine assurance that this is about to change. Haggai delivers the punch line to this oracle in the last clause of verse 19: "From this day on I will bless you." Because they have turned to the Lord, the Lord is about to turn their curses into blessings. These blessings arrive long before the temple is completed—the temple is not finished until the sixth year of Darius (515 BC; cf. Ezra 6:15), whereas the blessings promised here are evident in bumper harvests the very next season. Their prosperity is not because a completed temple has led to an outpouring of God's divine favor, or because a completed temple has made their offerings acceptable to God. They are—from that day onward—beginning to experience God's divine favor (blessing) as a result of his unmerited mercy.

<span id="page-625-10"></span><span id="page-625-8"></span><span id="page-625-1"></span>2:20–22 A second "word of the Lord" is given to Haggai the day the temple foundation is laid. As noted above, the two oracles should be taken as a pair, describing the immediate (vv. 10–19) and ultimate (vv. 20–23) implications of the restoration of God's dwelling place. Whereas the focus of the first oracle is "this day" (the 24th day of the 9th month), the second oracle describes what will happen "on that day" (v. 23) when, at some future time, God will restore "kingdom" and "kingship" to his people.

<span id="page-625-14"></span><span id="page-625-12"></span>This second oracle is addressed to Zerubbabel as the "governor of Judah" and focuses on the climactic promise given to Zerubbabel in verse 23, to which verses 21–22 are a necessary prelude. As the governor appointed by Darius, Zerubbabel is the highest-ranking official in the land. But God's people, who know the promises of the earlier prophets, long for something more. Zerubbabel is also of the Davidic line, and the prophets had promised a day when God would raise up a righteous king from the descendants of David (Jer. 23:5–6). But at the time of Haggai's writing, the king over them was not Zerubbabel but Darius (cf. Hag. 1:1).

<span id="page-625-11"></span><span id="page-625-7"></span><span id="page-625-6"></span><span id="page-625-5"></span><span id="page-625-4"></span><span id="page-625-2"></span>In 2:21 the Lord promises, "I am about to shake the heavens and the earth." Although Haggai's hearers might have expected this to occur imminently, the promise must be understood in parallel with the "shaking" promised "in a little while" (v. 6). The promise to shake the heavens and the earth appears in other contexts to describe God's end-time judgment on the nations (Isa. 13:13; Ezek. 38:20; Joel 3:16). Here the purpose of the shaking is to overthrow4 thrones and kingdoms, so that the throne of David and the kingdom of Israel may be restored. The prophets promised a reciprocal reversal after the exile: the nations would be brought low so that the Lord could raise up his people and restore their fortunes (cf., e.g., Isa. 52:9–10; Jer. 30:16–17; 50:17–19; Joel 3:1–2; Mic. 5:9; Zech. 1:18–21).

<span id="page-625-13"></span><span id="page-625-3"></span>Haggai 2:22 alludes to two episodes from Israel's history to show what God will do to the "strength of the kingdoms." As he did to Egypt in the exodus, he will

<span id="page-625-0"></span><sup>4</sup> The word for "overthrow" was used several times to describe the "overthrow" of Sodom and Gomorrah (Deut. 29:23; Isa. 13:19; Jer. 49:18; 50:40; Lam. 4:6; Amos 4:11). Such will be the fate of all kingdoms.

<span id="page-626-3"></span><span id="page-626-1"></span><span id="page-626-0"></span>"overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall go down" (cf. Ex. 14:23–25; 15:1–5). And as he did to the Midianites, the Lord will set the sword of each man against the other (Judg. 7:22).5 In both of these episodes it was obvious even to God's enemies that he was fighting for Israel (cf. Ex. 14:25; Judg. 7:2, 14–15): in each case the Lord is warrior and Israel is passive. These verses are calling Haggai's generation not to take up arms in revolt against their Persian overlords but to wait for the day when God himself would overturn the political order.

<span id="page-626-2"></span>The "shaking" and "overturning" is not described against any specific nation. It is expressed in nonspecific terms because the focus is on the implications this shaking will have for Israel. All other thrones and kingdoms are overturned to bring about the promise of Haggai 2:23.

<span id="page-626-11"></span><span id="page-626-10"></span><span id="page-626-8"></span><span id="page-626-7"></span>2:23 Zerubbabel is identified here not as "governor of Judah" (as in v. 21) but as the "son of Shealtiel," highlighting his Davidic ancestry. The promise that Zerubbabel will be like a "signet ring" must be understood in relation to a prior "signet ring" prophecy in Jeremiah 22:24–30, where God declares, "though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off" (v. 24). The signet ring was a sign of royal authority, and tearing off the signet ring represented the Lord's rejection of Coniah as king. This has implications not only for Coniah but also for his offspring. Jeremiah's prophecy ends, "None of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah" (Jer. 22:30). This is especially significant for Haggai 2:23, because Coniah (also known as Jeconiah or Jehoiachin) was grandfather of Zerubbabel. Does this exclusion from the throne of David apply only to Coniah's direct offspring (i.e., Shealtiel), or does it apply to his entire lineage, thus signifying the end of the Davidic dynasty?

<span id="page-626-9"></span>The "signet ring" prophecy in Haggai signals the continuation of David's royal line through Zerubbabel. Many commentators resist this understanding of the "signet ring," perhaps from a desire to protect Haggai from "mistaken messianism" (because Zerubbabel was never crowned king). However, this misses the point of the prophecy. What Coniah lost was not merely his own kingship but the dynastic succession of the line of David. This is what is promised to Zerubbabel in Haggai's oracle: continuation of the royal line of descent. The Lord's description of Zerubbabel as "my servant" and his statement "I have chosen you" echo the language of 1 Kings 11:34, which describes a continuing dynastic succession "for the sake of David *my servant* whom I *chose*." When the NT traces the royal line of David, it is through Zerubbabel that the line continues after the exile, culminating ultimately in Christ (Matt. 1:12).

<span id="page-626-12"></span><span id="page-626-5"></span>This oracle declares that God will restore a king from the line of David. He will overthrow the kingdoms and thrones of the nations to reestablish his kingdom and put his king on the throne above all thrones.

<span id="page-626-6"></span><span id="page-626-4"></span><sup>5</sup> The manner of the Midianite confusion and defeat is a motif repeated elsewhere: 1 Samuel 14:20; Isaiah 19:2; Ezekiel 38:21; Zechariah 14:21.

### *Response*

<span id="page-627-1"></span><span id="page-627-0"></span>The two oracles in 2:10–23 mark a turning point in the relationship between God and his people. After the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, what had been unclean and unacceptable was now clean and acceptable, and what had been cursed was now blessed (vv. 10–19); because of what happened on that day, the people could be sure the rejected kingship and ruined kingdom of Israel would be restored and renewed (vv. 20–23). This date was a crucial turning point as the day the foundations of the temple were established. Laying the foundations anticipated the day when God would dwell in the midst of his people, when sins would be forgiven and worshipers cleansed, their offerings made acceptable in his sight. Furthermore, restoring the temple in Jerusalem necessarily led to the restoration of God's kingdom and the reign of his king. These twin oracles encouraged Haggai's generation to keep looking back to "foundation day" to realize what had already been accomplished.

<span id="page-627-8"></span><span id="page-627-3"></span>It is the same for the Christian. Like Abraham, we too are "looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God" (Heb. 11:10). Jesus Christ is the foundation of this city, the ultimate dwelling place of God (1 Cor. 3:11; Rev. 21:14). Jesus is the "cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord" (Eph. 2:20–21). As we await the final appearing of this city, we must continue looking back to our "foundation day," the guarantee of present blessing and future restoration.

<span id="page-627-7"></span><span id="page-627-5"></span>Our "foundation day" occurred at the death and resurrection of Christ; just as the foundation day was the pivotal moment for Haggai's generation, so too for us. Because of what Jesus has *already* done, contamination from sin has been dealt with once and for all. No longer are we in that hopeless situation where impure worshipers offer unclean sacrifices unacceptable to God. Jesus' once-for-all sacrifice has fully purified those who draw near to worship, so that we may approach the throne of grace with confidence (Heb. 10:1–2, 19–22). No longer does the Lord declare unclean every work of our hands. Likewise, just as from foundation day onward the Lord said to Haggai's generation, "I will bless you," so too our foundation day means God's curses no longer fall on us: we have already been "blessed . . . in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places" (Eph. 1:3). We have already begun to live the blessed life of the kingdom (cf. Matt. 5:3–11), and even greater blessing is yet to come (Titus 2:13), when all cursing will end (Rev. 22:3).

<span id="page-627-9"></span><span id="page-627-6"></span><span id="page-627-4"></span><span id="page-627-2"></span>Our "foundation day" was also the day when Jesus became the Lord's signet ring. Only through the eyes of faith could Haggai's contemporaries perceive Zerubbabel as the Lord's signet ring, because continuation of the Davidic line through him remained hidden until the shaking of the heavens and the earth. Likewise, Jesus has already been crowned with all royal authority and power, but at present this reality is not in plain view. We need the eyes of faith to see the one who—right now—is already at the center of heaven's throne, who is indeed worthy to "receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing" (Rev. 5:12). We too should be longing for the day when God will

<span id="page-628-1"></span>shake the heavens and the earth once more, to establish forever a "kingdom that cannot be shaken" (Heb. 12:28). Like Haggai's generation, we should look back to our "foundation day," as it guarantees our final day.

<span id="page-628-0"></span>The final oracles in Haggai 2 remind us that our "foundation day"—what Christ has already done for us—has achieved for us God's favor and blessing in the here and now, guaranteeing for us an unshakable kingdom in the future. We should cling tightly to the hope that is already ours, built on the sure foundation of Jesus Christ.

# ZECHARIAH

*Anthony R. Petterson*

## INTRODUCTION TO ZECHARIAH

### *Overview*

<span id="page-631-3"></span><span id="page-631-2"></span><span id="page-631-1"></span>The book of Zechariah anticipates the coming kingdom of God. It opens in 520 BC, twenty years after the first Jews had returned from exile in Babylon to the region of Judah. Earlier prophets had promised a glorious restoration for the nation (e.g., Zeph. 3:20), but the reality for the returnees fell far short of those prophetic expectations. Their initial efforts to rebuild the city of Jerusalem, the temple, and their community life met with great frustration, and they fell into complacency. Into this situation, the prophet Zechariah (a contemporary of Haggai) calls the people to return to the Lord (Zech. 1:1–6). The Lord gives the prophet eight night visions promising the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple, the overthrow of hostile nations, the eradication of wickedness, and the Lord's return to his people—along with a future Davidic king, the Messiah (1:7–6:8). Zechariah is then given a prophetic sign-action to perform to give assurance that these things will take place (6:9–15). Two years after these visions, when the temple is near completion, a delegation is sent from Bethel to ask the leadership in Jerusalem whether fasting is still appropriate (fasting seems to have been instituted after the destruction of Jerusalem a generation earlier). Zechariah calls on the people to pursue obedience to the national covenant and set their sights on the consummation of God's kingdom, when fasting will become feasting and the nations will come to Jerusalem to share in this blessing (7:1–8:23).

<span id="page-631-8"></span><span id="page-631-7"></span><span id="page-631-6"></span><span id="page-631-5"></span><span id="page-631-4"></span>Zechariah 9–14 shifts in literary style and reflects a time after the completion of the temple. It contains two "oracles" (chs. 9–11 and chs. 12–14) portraying dramatically the Lord's returning to his people and establishing his kingdom. These oracles depict a future battle against the nations and explore from different perspectives what the return of the Lord means for the nations, God's people, his leaders, his future king (the Messiah), Jerusalem, Judah, and the heavens and the earth.

## *Title*

<span id="page-631-0"></span>The book of Zechariah is named after the prophet whose prophecies it records. "Zechariah" means "Yah[weh] has remembered." This is a fitting name for a prophet whose message is concerned with the Lord's returning to his people and "remembering" (i.e., acting on) his covenant promises (cf. Ex. 2:24). Yet the book does not make anything of Zechariah's name, and its meaning would be appropriate for other prophets as well.

## *Author*

<span id="page-632-10"></span><span id="page-632-4"></span><span id="page-632-3"></span>The prophet Zechariah is known outside his book for the key role he played, along with Haggai, in rebuilding the temple (cf. Ezra 5:1; 6:14). His genealogy places him in a priestly family (Zech. 1:1, 7; Neh. 12:4, 16). If he is the "Zechariah son of Barachiah" mentioned in Matt. 23:35 (also Luke 11:51), then he was later "murdered between the sanctuary and the altar."1

### *Date and Occasion*

The book contains three dates (1:1, 7; 7:1), corresponding to the years 520, 519, and 518 BC. About twenty years earlier (in 539 BC), the Persian king Cyrus had incorporated Babylon into his empire with limited resistance. Cyrus then issued an edict allowing the Jewish exiles to return from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.2 The book of Ezra reports how a first group of exiles, led by the Jewish governor Sheshbazzar, returned to Jerusalem in 538 BC. Although they returned and began the rebuilding with enthusiasm, they soon faced many difficulties, including famine (e.g., Hag. 1:9–11; 2:15–19), internal disagreements (Zech. 8:10), and hostile opposition from neighboring Samaritans (Ezra 4). Work on rebuilding the temple came to a standstill (Ezra 4:24) and did not progress until Haggai and Zechariah began to prophesy some twenty years later.

<span id="page-632-5"></span><span id="page-632-2"></span><span id="page-632-1"></span>Cyrus ruled until dying in battle in 530 BC. He was succeeded by his son Cambyses, who ruled until his death in 522. One of Cambyses's military commanders, Darius, then took control, put down several revolts, and settled into a long and stable reign over the Persian Empire until 486 BC. Zechariah prophesied during the reign of Darius (Zech. 1:1, 7; 7:1), who proved to be supportive of the temple rebuilding project.

<span id="page-632-9"></span><span id="page-632-8"></span><span id="page-632-7"></span><span id="page-632-6"></span>Ezra 6:15 indicates the temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of Darius (usually considered March 12, 515 BC). Since the completion of the temple is one of the concerns of Zechariah 1–8, these chapters are considered to have been written around that time. Chapters 9–14 presuppose a completed temple, seen in the sign-action in 11:13 of Zechariah throwing thirty pieces of silver to the potter in the temple, and so these chapters seem to come later in Zechariah's ministry. However, while parts of the book come from different periods in Zechariah's prophetic work, the book as a whole was compiled and shaped to address an audience after the completion of the temple and should be

<span id="page-632-0"></span><sup>1</sup> Alternatively, Matthew's reference to "Zechariah son of Barachiah" could be to the "Zechariah son of Jehoiada" of 2 Chronicles 24:20–22, who was stoned to death in the temple. The main problem with this option is the different patronymic. However, "son of" can mean "descendant of," and "Jehoiada" may be Zechariah's grandfather—but this is conjectural. The argument that Jesus is referring to Abel in the first book of the OT (Genesis) and Zechariah in the last (Chronicles) is problematic since there was no canonical arrangement of the Writings in Jesus' day. Individual scrolls were ordered only later when put into codex (book) form, and Chronicles is the first of the Writings in the Leningrad Codex.

<sup>2</sup> Evidence outside the OT for Cyrus's policy is found in the Cyrus Cylinder (lines 26–36), although it does not directly name the Jewish people.

<span id="page-633-5"></span>read from this perspective, especially when it comes to identifying figures like "the Branch" (3:8; 6:12).

## *Genre and Literary Features*

Zechariah exhibits a variety of literary genres. Chapters 1–6 contain eight visions given to Zechariah at night. In each vision the prophet is shown a scene, and an angel usually explains its key features. It is important to interpret these visions against the background of earlier OT writings, which help clarify the elements of the visions and provide keys to interpretation.

<span id="page-633-11"></span><span id="page-633-7"></span>Zechariah also contains three prophetic sign-actions. The first is in 6:9–15 and the other two are in 11:4–17. Sign-actions are visible representations of the prophet's message, acted out like a drama. However, there are elements of the sign-action in chapter 11 that would have been difficult for Zechariah to act out.

<span id="page-633-10"></span><span id="page-633-8"></span>Chapters 7–8 contain a narrative of a delegation from Bethel seeking instruction about continued fasting as the temple nears completion. This provides an occasion for Zechariah to reapply relevant covenant requirements to the people and restate the hope for restoration. These chapters function as a transition between the two main parts of the book.

<span id="page-633-9"></span>Finally, chapters 9–14 comprise two prophetic oracles (chs. 9–11; 12–14), portraying in many graphic images the Lord's establishing his kingdom. The Lord will return to his people, defeat enemy nations, raise up a new leadership, bring forgiveness and cleansing through the death of the future Davidic king (the Messiah), eradicate wickedness, and open up worship in Jerusalem to all nations.

## *Theology of Zechariah; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

The following key themes of Zechariah are set in the wider context of the OT and traced through to their fulfillment in Jesus Christ. (The next section, "Preaching from Zechariah," will offer rationale and guidance for reading Zechariah in relationship to Christ and the NT.)

#### THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE LORD

<span id="page-633-4"></span><span id="page-633-3"></span><span id="page-633-2"></span>The sovereign rule of God is a theme found throughout the Bible and portrayed clearly in Zechariah. The book consistently calls God the "Lord of hosts" (cf. comment on 1:2–6a). He is the one king over all the earth (14:9). He will judge nations opposed to him and his people (1:21; 2:9; 9:1–14:21) and will save his people (Jerusalem/Zion) and those from the nations who seek him (2:11; 8:20; 9:7; 14:16). This concern for blessing and cursing the nations is in keeping with his promise to Abraham (Gen. 12:3; 17:4–7) and is grounded in his sovereign purpose in creation to bless all the world (Gen. 1:28). It is fulfilled in the Lord Jesus, who brings salvation to the nations (Gal. 3:14) and will judge those who reject his rule.

<span id="page-633-13"></span><span id="page-633-12"></span><span id="page-633-6"></span><span id="page-633-1"></span><span id="page-633-0"></span>God's people have an important role to play in this restoration by returning to him, rebuilding the temple, and responding in covenant obedience, yet the restoration is ultimately God's work, by his Spirit (e.g., Zech. 4:6; 9:16; 12:7–10). While <span id="page-634-8"></span>Zechariah's time is described as a "day of small things," with much hardship and disappointment (4:10), the sovereignty of the Lord assures readers and hearers of Zechariah that God's promises for a glorious future will come to pass.

#### THE RETURN OF THE LORD

<span id="page-634-2"></span>God's return to his people after judgment in exile is a key theme across the book, and the prophet Ezekiel provides a helpful backdrop. Ezekiel depicts the glory of the Lord departing from the temple and Jerusalem on account of sin, particularly idolatry (Ezekiel 8–11). The departure of the presence of the Lord was a death sentence for Jerusalem, and it was not long before the city was destroyed by the Babylonians. However, Ezekiel also anticipates God's return to the temple after the judgment of exile (Ezek. 43:1–5), accompanied by covenant restoration and blessing.

<span id="page-634-6"></span><span id="page-634-5"></span><span id="page-634-3"></span>Nearly seventy years after the destruction of Jerusalem and some twenty years after the first group of exiles had returned, Zechariah declares that God has now turned from judging his people to showing mercy (Zech. 1:16; 8:3). The punishment the nation deserved for their sin has been served, and God promises to return to dwell among them once again (1:3; 2:5, 10–11; 4:9–10; 8:3). In view of God's return, Zechariah calls the people to return to God by rebuilding the temple and obeying his covenant requirements. The two oracles in chapters 9–14 dramatically portray the Lord's return to establish his kingdom (e.g., 9:8; 14:5). The Lord will overcome all opposition to his reign and bring salvation and blessing to all creation.

<span id="page-634-14"></span><span id="page-634-12"></span><span id="page-634-11"></span><span id="page-634-10"></span>While Zechariah anticipates the return of the Lord to Jerusalem, there is no indication in this book or in other postexilic writings that the glory ever returned to the temple in this period. Yet the book continues to foster hope for the return of God's glory to the temple. The NT writers see the realization of this hope in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ—Immanuel (God with us). For instance, in the prologue to his Gospel, John says that "we have seen his glory" (John 1:14). Similarly, Paul says that in Christ we see the "glory of the Lord" (2 Cor. 3:18). God returned to his people in the Word-become-flesh, the one who dwelt (or "tabernacled") among his people. He fulfilled all that the temple stood for—the presence and rule of God to bring blessing (John 2:19–21). Hence Zechariah's hope for the return of the Lord to his people, bringing salvation and blessing, is realized in Jesus.

#### <span id="page-634-13"></span>THE HOPE FOR A FUTURE DAVIDIC KING (MESSIAH)

<span id="page-634-9"></span><span id="page-634-7"></span><span id="page-634-4"></span><span id="page-634-1"></span><span id="page-634-0"></span>Closely associated with the return of the Lord to his people is the hope for a future Davidic king (Messiah). In Zechariah 1–6, this king is called "the Branch" (or "Shoot"), a name derived from the prophecy of Jeremiah (cf. Jer. 23:5; 33:15) and the imagery of Isaiah and Ezekiel (Isa. 11:1; Ezekiel 17). Zechariah envisions a future king serving as priest (Zech. 6:13) and associated with God's removing the iniquity of the land and reversing its consequences (3:8–9; cf. 13:1).

<span id="page-635-6"></span><span id="page-635-5"></span>Chapter 9 pictures the Lord's return to Jerusalem to establish his kingdom, and at the center of this presentation is the future Davidic king—righteous and saved, afflicted and riding on a donkey (9:9; cf. comment on 9:9–10). Whereas many of Israel's kings of the past were proud and failed to exercise justice and righteousness, this king will be different and will preach peace (cf. 6:13).

<span id="page-635-7"></span><span id="page-635-4"></span>While the identities of the one pierced in 12:10 and the shepherd struck in 13:7 prove elusive to many, if these figures are understood in relation to the expectation for a future king that the book earlier establishes, they are readily understood as further portraits of the Messiah. Like the suffering servant of Isaiah, Zechariah prophesies the death of a future ideal king as part of God's purpose to bring forgiveness and restoration of covenant relationship between God and his people (cf. 13:1, 9).

<span id="page-635-8"></span>The NT identifies the future Davidic king as Jesus. Significantly, after the Psalms, Zechariah is the most-quoted portion of the OT in the passion narratives of the Gospels. Zechariah anticipates the coming of Jesus, who won the victory over the enemies of God's people through his death on the cross and will fully realize this victory when he returns.

#### THE NATIONAL COVENANT, ETHICS, AND TEMPLE REBUILDING

Like the other postexilic books of Haggai and Malachi, Zechariah must be read against the background of God's national covenant with Israel at Sinai. The book of Exodus records how God saved his people by grace, then gave them the law to teach them how to live as his saved people. The law was never a means of salvation; rather, it was the means by which God's people were to live out their salvation to reflect the character of God in the world. This relationship is formalized in a covenant, as the people commit themselves to obedience in view of all God had done to initiate the relationship and save them. At the end of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, Moses lists the blessings the people will experience should they obey, but also the curses to come upon them should they disobey, culminating in the curse of being exiled from the Promised Land (e.g., Deut. 28:63–68). While Moses anticipates that this disaster will surely happen, this is not the last word. God promises restoration and blessing when the people repent ("return") and obey (Deut. 30:1–3). The people's repentance is ultimately brought about by God (Deut. 30:6), underscoring again his grace.

<span id="page-635-3"></span><span id="page-635-2"></span><span id="page-635-1"></span><span id="page-635-0"></span>This is the background for the Lord's call through Zechariah to "return to me . . . and I will return to you" (Zech. 1:3). He is calling the people back to covenant obedience and promising the blessings of covenant relationship. In this way, Zechariah grounds the ethical transformation of the people in the compassion (or grace) of God. Relationship with God is not earned through obedience; rather, obedience is the sign of being in right relationship with God. Indeed, the story of Israel records God's compassion and justice to his people, which the people were called to reflect in their own lives and in their national life. For instance, God's people were to treat the alien living among them just as the native-born, and the one who had less power and resources with compassion, love, truth, and peace <span id="page-636-5"></span><span id="page-636-3"></span><span id="page-636-0"></span>(e.g., Lev. 19:33–37). This concern for right living in accordance with the national covenant is seen throughout Zechariah (e.g., 3:7; 5:1–11; 6:15; 7:10; 8:16–17; 13:2–6). The same theology underlies Christian ethics. It is the gospel of God's mercy and grace that is to shape Christian behavior (e.g., Rom. 12:1–2), including our response to the vulnerable and poor (Rom. 12:8, 13, 20).

<span id="page-636-8"></span><span id="page-636-7"></span><span id="page-636-6"></span><span id="page-636-1"></span>Both ethics and the concern to rebuild the temple are an outworking of the restored relationship between God and his people now that the seventy years of exile are complete (cf. Zech. 1:12). While Christians are not called to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, we are to be actively engaged in Jesus' commission to build his temple, the church (cf. Matt. 28:19–20; Eph. 4:11–13). Zechariah challenges the church not to be despondent or despise the day of small things; rather, "Let your hands be strong" (Zech. 8:9, 13). Furthermore, Christians should seek to reflect God's character in our lives, for his glorious kingdom is coming.

## <span id="page-636-4"></span>*Preaching from Zechariah*

<span id="page-636-2"></span>The variety of literary genres in Zechariah makes it a stimulating book to preach. Some passages readily stand on their own, such as chapter 3. Other passages can be linked together by theme; e.g., the first three night-visions feature the return of the Lord to Jerusalem. The book can be broken down differently, depending on the time available for a series. The following are some suggestions:

#### PREACHING THE NIGHT VISIONS

While Zechariah is not strictly apocalyptic literature, an understanding of how this literary genre works will aid preaching. Apocalyptic literature paints striking pictures with words. It draws in the audience by arousing curiosity and creating something of a puzzle that calls for an explanation, similar to Jesus' parables. When things fall into place, there is an "Aha! moment," by which time the audience is drawn into the visionary world. In preaching Zechariah's night visions, it is good to ask questions about what Zechariah is reported as seeing so as to arouse curiosity and build tension before seeking to explain the important elements and the overall meaning of the vision.

<span id="page-637-0"></span>One mistake in interpreting apocalyptic literature is to seek to identify the significance of every element of the picture. Some elements simply contribute to the picture's background and have no other purpose. The important elements of the vision are the ones that are explained, and these are the ones that should be focused on in preaching. For instance, in the first vision there is no meaning given to the different colors of the horses (1:8). All the colors seem to do is distinguish between the groups of horses. What is important is what the horses do: patrol the earth as agents of the Lord and expressions of his sovereignty (1:11). Since this is explained in the vision, it is the significant element that must be focused on in preaching.

<span id="page-637-3"></span><span id="page-637-2"></span><span id="page-637-1"></span>There is also a movement through the visions that is important to recognize. Visions 1–5 portray God's returning to his people, bringing forgiveness, cleansing, and prosperity. This sequence finishes with a house (temple) built for the Lord in Jerusalem (ch. 4). In visions 6–8 there is the opposite movement. Iniquity, wickedness, and all that is opposed to God are driven from the land. In this sequence, the houses of the covenant breakers come crashing in on their heads (5:4), a house is built for wickedness in Babylon (5:11), and Babylon experiences the Lord's wrath (6:8). Recognizing this movement and the themes connecting the visions may help when preaching on more than one vision at a time.

#### <span id="page-637-4"></span>PREACHING THE SIGN-ACTIONS

Sign-actions are visible representations of the prophetic message designed not only to convey the message but also to affect the emotions. Just as seeing a play or drama on stage can have a greater impact than reading it on the page, so the preacher should try to bring the drama alive as much as possible. Like the night visions, the key elements of the prophetic drama need to be explained and their impact felt.

#### PREACHING THE ORACLES

<span id="page-637-5"></span>Like the night visions, an understanding of how apocalyptic literature works is useful also for preaching the oracles. Just as the book of Revelation pictures the same reality in a cycle of seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls, so chapters 9–14 of Zechariah look at the reality of God's coming kingdom from different <span id="page-638-0"></span>perspectives. While there are a number of battles mentioned in these chapters, it is not a sequence of different battles. Rather, it is one end-time battle ushering in God's kingdom, explored from different perspectives; each perspective contributes something more to the overall picture. Chapters 9 and 12 give the "big picture" of what will happen "on that day" as God saves and delivers his people from their enemies. The focus of chapters 10–11 is what this day will mean for the leadership of God's people, while the focus in chapters 13–14 is the cleansing coming on that day as Jerusalem is cleansed of sin and made holy.

#### <span id="page-638-6"></span><span id="page-638-3"></span>PREACHING CHRIST FROM ZECHARIAH

<span id="page-638-11"></span><span id="page-638-10"></span><span id="page-638-9"></span>Followers of Jesus Christ must follow his lead in looking for ways in which the OT testifies to him (cf. Luke 24:27, 44). The NT demonstrates how the earliest Christians explored a wide range of OT passages to show their fulfillment in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Christians are likewise encouraged to follow the example of Jesus, the apostles, and other NT authors in interpreting the OT in a way that proclaims Jesus as Savior and Lord (e.g., Acts 10:43; Rom. 1:1–4; 3:21–22).3 This does not mean that every OT sermon will have Jesus "tacked on" in the same predictable way, but it does mean that every OT sermon will be approached through a framework of understanding Jesus as the fulfillment of the hopes for Israel and the world. This gospel framework is like a prism refracting the light of the OT into a spectacular spectrum of color—there is no excuse for being monochromatic and predictable in each sermon. It is not that Christ is to be read back into the OT in ways that seem forced; instead, the preacher is to show how the people, laws, institutions, and events in the OT anticipate and illuminate the significance of Jesus Christ (who he is and what he has accomplished) and what it means to live as God's people now in light of the new covenant he has established (identifying elements of continuity and discontinuity). Preaching the OT in light of the gospel of Jesus Christ is essential to avoid the twin dangers of allegorizing the OT or moralizing its message by teaching "rules" and "morals" without grace.4

<span id="page-638-2"></span><span id="page-638-1"></span>The gospel of Jesus is often neglected in the preaching of Zechariah by approaching the book (esp. chs. 9–14) as if it were all about Jesus' second coming and events at the end of the world. This fails to see how the NT cites and alludes to Zechariah with reference to Jesus' first coming. For instance, all the Gospel writers report that Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem (Zech. 9:9). Jesus quotes 13:7 ("I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered") just before being arrested (Matt. 26:31). Judas's betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver has Zechariah 11:12–13 in the background. The piercing of Jesus' side by the soldier fulfills 12:10 (cf. Rev. 1:7). His driving out the merchants from the temple fulfills Zechariah 14:21. These references show how the kingdom prophesied in Zechariah came initially in the first coming of Jesus.

<span id="page-638-8"></span><span id="page-638-7"></span><span id="page-638-5"></span><span id="page-638-4"></span><sup>3</sup> For a brief review of approaches to preaching Christ from the OT, see David Peterson, *Christ and His People in the Book of Isaiah* (Leicester, UK: IVP, 2003), 11–25.

<sup>4</sup> On these dangers, see Edmund P. Clowney, *Preaching Christ in All of Scripture* (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2003), 32–34.

<span id="page-639-11"></span><span id="page-639-10"></span><span id="page-639-9"></span>At the same time, the book of Revelation connects the imagery of Zechariah with the new Jerusalem to be realized at Jesus' return. Consider, e.g., "living waters" (Zech. 14:8; cf. Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17); Jerusalem as a place of feasting (Zech. 14:16, 19, 21; cf. Rev. 19:9); absence of night (Zech. 14:6; cf. Rev. 21:25; 22:5); the city's holiness (Zech. 14:20–21; cf. Rev. 22:11, 14); worship and tribute of the nations (Zech. 2:11; 8:22–23; 14:16; cf. Rev. 21:24, 26; 22:2); exclusion of all wickedness (Zech. 13:2–6; 14:21; cf. Rev. 21:8; 22:15); and the kingship of God (Zech. 14:9; cf. Rev. 22:1, which includes the kingship of the Lamb).

<span id="page-639-13"></span><span id="page-639-7"></span><span id="page-639-2"></span><span id="page-639-1"></span>These examples illustrate the NT's "already and not yet" time frame for the fulfillment of Zechariah's hopes for God's coming kingdom, and in both instances (the "already" and the "not yet") Christ is central. At the same time, the themes of Zechariah are directly relevant for the church today, and the application of Zechariah's message will be considered in the "Response" sections of the commentary that follows. These sections may be a stimulus for application in preaching. Some of these themes for application include the continuing call to repent from sin (Zech. 1:3; cf. Matt. 3:8; 2 Pet. 3:9); the need for cleansing, forgiveness, and holiness (Zech. 3:4, 9; 13:1; 14:20–21; cf. Eph. 5:26; Col. 1:14; 1 Pet. 1:15–16); the way in which building the temple connects with building the church (Zechariah 4; cf. Eph. 2:21–22); the expectation that God's people will be refined by suffering (Zech. 13:8; cf. 1 Pet. 1:7); and the Christian life as a battle (Zech. 9:13; 10:5, 7; 12:6–9; 14:2–3; cf. 2 Cor. 10:4–5; Col. 3:5).

#### THE UNITY OF THE BOOK

<span id="page-639-5"></span><span id="page-639-0"></span>Since the seventeenth century, some scholars have challenged the traditional view that Zechariah is the author of the book. While most scholars see much of chapters 1–8 as coming from Zechariah, the different literary style of chapters 9–14 and some of their historical references, such as "Greece" (9:13), are taken by some to indicate someone other than Zechariah is responsible for those chapters. Earlier scholars in this period argued that 9–14 are preexilic, but in the eighteenth century a number of scholars came to believe these chapters were composed hundreds of years after Zechariah, in the Greek period (4th to 2nd centuries BC).

Recent scholarship on Zechariah supports reading the book as a unity and taking the book as it presents itself—essentially as the product of the prophet Zechariah. The development and coherence of many themes across the book provide evidence for this, along with several literary features consistent throughout the book. The often unstated assumption that Zechariah was able to write in only one literary style cannot be sustained. The different styles may simply reflect different stages in Zechariah's prophetic ministry, with chapters 1–8 reflecting the period before the temple's completion and 9–14 the period shortly after. We will see in the commentary how references in chapters 9–14 can be understood as consistent with Zechariah's time. In addition, there is no external evidence that

the book of Zechariah ever circulated in parts. While fragmentary, Qumran manuscripts support seeing Zechariah as a single work.

## <span id="page-642-1"></span>ZECHARIAH 1:1–6

1In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, **<sup>2</sup>** "The Lord was very angry with your fathers. **3**Therefore say to them, Thus declares the Lord of hosts: Return to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. **4**Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.' But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the Lord. **5**Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? **6**But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, 'As the Lord of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us.' "

### *Section Overview*

The book begins with a call to return to God in covenant obedience. If the people do so, God graciously promises to return to them.

<span id="page-642-5"></span><span id="page-642-4"></span><span id="page-642-3"></span><span id="page-642-2"></span><span id="page-642-0"></span>After a dating formula (1:1), Zechariah reviews Israel's past experience. The people refused to listen to God's word through his prophets and continued in willful rebellion (vv. 2–5). They were eventually overtaken by God's judgment, as he had warned (vv. 5–6a). In recounting this lesson from Israel's history, Zechariah calls on his contemporaries to return to the Lord in repentance (v. 3). This introductory passage concludes by recording the people's obedience to Zechariah's appeal (v. 6b).

<span id="page-643-16"></span><span id="page-643-14"></span><span id="page-643-13"></span><span id="page-643-10"></span>In relation to the rest of the book, the night visions (1:7–6:8), sign-action (6:9–15), and the prophet's reply to a query about fasting (7:1–8:23) indicate what this "return" (1:3), or repentance, should look like for God's people. The two prophetic oracles of chapters 9–14 portray vividly the impact of God's return for God's people and the entire world.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-643-12"></span><span id="page-643-9"></span><span id="page-643-4"></span>1:1 The dating formula locates Zechariah's prophetic ministry in reference to the Persian king Darius (cf. v. 7; 7:1; cf. Introduction: Date and Occasion). Whereas earlier Prophetic Books are dated with reference to the reigns of kings of Israel and Judah (e.g., Isa. 1:1; Hos. 1:1), dating with reference to a foreign king suggests the shadow of exile still hanging over God's people (cf. comment on Zech. 1:2–6a). The dating formula also places Zechariah in relation to Jeremiah's prophecy of seventy years of desolation for Judah as punishment for not heeding God's words (Jer. 25:4–12; cf. Zech. 1:12).

<span id="page-643-6"></span><span id="page-643-1"></span><span id="page-643-0"></span>Darius succeeded Cambyses (r. 530–522 BC) and Cyrus (r. 559–530). In 539 BC, Cyrus had decreed the Judean exiles in Babylonia could return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (cf. Ezra 1:1–4). However, an initial attempt to rebuild the temple came to a halt (Ezra 4:24). The date in this verse is some twenty years later (520 BC), and the "eighth month" is late October to late November, two months after temple building had resumed (cf. Hag. 1:14–15). This is around 66 years after the city of Jerusalem and its temple were destroyed by the Babylonians (in 586 BC).

<span id="page-643-15"></span><span id="page-643-7"></span><span id="page-643-2"></span>The phrase "the word of the Lord came to" is a messenger-reception formula indicating Zechariah's status as a prophet of God (cf. Zech. 7:1). The description "son of Berechiah, son of Iddo" places Zechariah in a priestly family (cf. Ezra 5:1; 6:14; Neh. 12:4–7, 16). This may explain the book's focus on the temple and cleansing from sin (like the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, also from priestly families).

<span id="page-643-11"></span><span id="page-643-3"></span>1:2–6a Zechariah addresses his contemporaries, whose "fathers" (or "ancestors") were those on whom God's anger fell, resulting ultimately in the destruction of Jerusalem and exile. God was "very angry" because their fathers refused to obey his word repeatedly spoken by the "former prophets" (v. 4). The "former prophets" can refer to prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel who called on the people to repent (e.g., Isa. 45:22; Jer. 18:11; 25:5; Ezek. 33:11), but is used also to refer to the Historical Books of Joshua—Kings, which also explain how the devastation and exile of the northern and southern kingdoms were because of God's wrath against sin.

<span id="page-643-5"></span>God is called "Lord of hosts," which can also be translated "Yahweh of armies" or "Yahweh, the Almighty." The "hosts" or "armies" are heavenly beings, such as <span id="page-644-10"></span><span id="page-644-5"></span>the horses and chariots in Zechariah 6:1–8. This title occurs fifty-three times in Zechariah and speaks of God's might as king and his universal rule. It occurs three times in 1:3 to emphasize why the people should listen to God's word through Zechariah.

Zechariah is to summon the people to "return to me"—a call to repentance and obedience to the national covenant.5 In response, God promises, "I will return to you"—a promise of full restoration of the blessings of the covenant. In the wider context of the book, this promise also speaks of God's return to the temple to dwell among his people, a key theme of Zechariah (cf. 1:16; 8:3, 15; 9:8–9; 14:16–21; cf. also Introduction: Theology of Zechariah: The Return of the Lord).

<span id="page-644-11"></span><span id="page-644-9"></span><span id="page-644-8"></span><span id="page-644-4"></span>To "return" (or "repent") involves turning to God "from your evil ways and from your evil deeds" (1:4; cf. Jer. 18:11; 25:5; 35:15). These evils the earlier prophets spoke against include idolatry, religious hypocrisy, and social injustice, which recurred among God's people in Zechariah's day (Zech. 5:3–4, 6; 7:9–10; 8:16–17; 10:2; 13:2). These evils are symptoms of a greater underlying problem God identifies when he says, "They did not hear or pay attention to me." The heart of sin is a heart that rejects the word of God. Indeed, to reject God's word is to reject God himself. This is why God was so angry with the fathers, who experienced his judgment.

<span id="page-644-6"></span>In 1:5, Zechariah asks two rhetorical questions to help his contemporaries reflect on the consequences of rejecting God's word. "Your fathers, where are they?" makes the point that the fathers have died in exile for their sins. "The prophets, do they live forever?" uses a form in Hebrew that expects the answer "no." The implication is that the prophets who provided the warning to God's people also eventually fell under his judgment and died. The people should heed God's word and return to him while there is still time.

<span id="page-644-3"></span><span id="page-644-2"></span>A third rhetorical question in verse 6a is designed to cause Zechariah's contemporaries to acknowledge that God's word achieves its purposes (cf. Isa. 55:11). The phrase "my words and my statutes" reflects Deuteronomy, where the phrase refers to the requirements of the national covenant and to the covenant itself (e.g., Deut. 28:15, 45; 29:1). The core of the prophets' task was to call Israel back to the national covenant, reminding them of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (e.g., Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28). In this context, "overtake" refers to the curses coming on the people for disobedience, climaxing in the judgment of exile (cf. Deut. 28:2, 45).

<span id="page-644-7"></span><span id="page-644-1"></span><span id="page-644-0"></span>1:6b Commentators are divided on whether it is the fathers or Zechariah's contemporaries who are reported as repenting ("they repented"). In the flow of the Hebrew, the pronoun "they" most naturally refers back to the fathers, as the ESV indicates. However, in terms of the logic of Zechariah's presentation, since judgment overtook the fathers and they are no more (v. 5), "they" is better understood as referring to Zechariah's contemporaries. What is reported in this verse is that

<sup>5</sup> The Hebrew word *shub* can be translated either "return" or "repent."

those who heard God's word proclaimed by Zechariah repented and acknowledged the rightness of God's dealings with his people. Significantly, the repentance of the returned exiles is also recounted as the response to the preaching of Haggai, Zechariah's contemporary (cf. Hag. 1:12–14).

### <span id="page-645-1"></span>*Response*

Zechariah calls on his contemporaries to heed God's word and not make the same mistake as their ancestors, who ignored God and his word and suffered his righteous judgment. Zechariah's charge to return to God remains for later readers and hearers of his book. To repent is more than merely feeling sorry for wrongdoing. It is not "doing penance" or punishing yourself for your sin. It is not a human work by which we can earn forgiveness. Repentance is turning from "evil ways . . . and evil deeds" back to God and obedience to his word. It is not a one-time act but an ongoing daily response to God's word.

<span id="page-645-0"></span>In his grace, God promises to return to his people. For Zechariah's contemporaries, this would have brought to mind God's promise in Jeremiah of restoration and forgiveness of sin after seventy years of exile, with God restoring the fortunes of the city of Jerusalem and the land, making a new covenant, and providing a righteous Davidic king (e.g., Jer. 29:10–14; 31:23–40; 33:6–26). This restoration and return of God to his people was fulfilled ultimately in the coming of Jesus. For readers and hearers of Zechariah today, the challenge of this passage is to turn to Jesus in repentance and faith with the knowledge that through his death he has won for us forgiveness and a restored relationship with God, along with the blessings of being his new covenant people. This passage also reminds us that God's word achieves its purposes in both judgment and salvation.

## <span id="page-645-2"></span>ZECHARIAH 1:7–17

**<sup>7</sup>**On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, **<sup>8</sup>** "I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses. **9**Then I said, 'What are these, my lord?' The angel who talked with me said to me, 'I will show you what they are.' **<sup>10</sup>** So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, 'These are they whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth.' **11**And they answered the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, 'We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.' **<sup>12</sup>**Then the angel of the Lord said, 'O Lord of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you

have been angry these seventy years?' **13**And the Lord answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me. **<sup>14</sup>** So the angel who talked with me said to me, 'Cry out, Thus says the Lord of hosts: I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion. **15**And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little, they furthered the disaster. **16**Therefore, thus says the Lord, I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; my house shall be built in it, declares the Lord of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem. **17**Cry out again, Thus says the Lord of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.' "

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-646-1"></span>Zechariah 1:7–6:8 contains eight night visions given to the prophet Zechariah. While they are not explicitly called "visions," they are to be understood as such since Zechariah is given them in a conscious state, as opposed to dreams, which are given in sleep (note how Zechariah is awakened by the interpreting angel in 4:1 and then, once awakened, is shown the next vision).

<span id="page-646-3"></span><span id="page-646-2"></span><span id="page-646-0"></span>These night visions display a thematic pattern. In the first five visions (1:7– 4:14), God is portrayed as returning to his people to establish his kingdom, bringing forgiveness, cleansing, and blessing. The last three visions (5:1–6:8) picture the opposite movement—sin and sinners are judged and all that is opposed to God is driven from the land. The backdrop for these visions is God's earlier abandonment of the Jerusalem temple, his palace, in the Babylonian destruction and captivity of 586 BC. This first vision proclaims the end of the exile, God's coming judgment of the nations, the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple, and his return to restore abundant blessing. Theologically it emphasizes the sovereignty of God, who will establish his kingdom.

While the visions are not strictly apocalyptic literature, they share many features of this literary genre, and it is useful to interpret them in view of this (cf. Introduction: Preaching from Zechariah: Preaching the Night Visions). Sometimes aspects of the visions simply contribute to the overall picture rather than having specific significance, so it is important not to seek meaning in every detail Zechariah reports. The important elements are those identified and explained in the text.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-647-10"></span><span id="page-647-2"></span><span id="page-647-0"></span>1:7 The sequence of eight night visions is introduced with a further dating formula, this time with a specific date (cf. 1:1 and comment). The "eleventh month" is identified as "Shebat," a Babylonian name adopted by the people of Judah (cf. "Chislev"; 7:1). Dating to the reign of a foreign king (cf. 1:1) and using the language of foreign nations ("Shebat") indicates a situation that should not be: even though God's people have returned to Jerusalem, they are still experiencing elements of exile. The date corresponds to February 15, 519 BC, about three months after the date in verse 1.

<span id="page-647-1"></span>"The word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah" underscores again the divine origin of Zechariah's message (cf. vv. 1, 3).

<span id="page-647-3"></span>1:8 God's word comes to Zechariah as a series of night visions. All eight visions were likely received on this one night, since none of the other visions are dated, and each new vision is closely joined to the previous one by the Hebrew syntax.

<span id="page-647-11"></span>Zechariah sees a "man riding on a red horse." Horses were used for military or royal purposes and have great speed. Behind the man were "red, sorrel, and white horses." These are typical horse colors and do not seem to function symbolically here (unlike in Revelation 6). The color red could also be translated "chestnut," and sorrel could also be translated "bay," a bright color that may have a yellow, gold, or red hue.6 In Hebrew, the colors are a plural form of the adjective, suggesting multiple horses of each color. While not explicit, verse 11 suggests the horses have riders, since they speak to the angel of the Lord. The significance of the "myrtle trees in the glen" is not stated; "glen" is difficult to translate but could also be translated "by the deep," referring to a body of water, such as a river, beside which myrtles were growing. These features may contribute only to the picture portrayed in the vision, not its meaning.

<span id="page-647-4"></span>1:9–10 The angel who speaks with Zechariah is found in seven of the eight visions and explains the important features of the visions (he is often called the "interpreting angel" to distinguish him from other angelic figures). Here he promises to show Zechariah the significance of the scene.

<span id="page-647-6"></span><span id="page-647-5"></span>The man who "was standing among the myrtle trees" (v. 10) is later identified as the "angel of the Lord" (v. 11), and he explains the function of the horses: they have been "sent to patrol the earth" (v. 10). Modeled on the Persian horsemen who patrolled the empire (carrying messages and garnering intelligence like Sauron's Ringwraiths in *The Lord of the Rings*, but without sinister overtones), these horses provide surveillance for God and express his sovereign rule over the "earth" (Hb. *'erets*).7

<sup>6</sup> See further J. E. Hartley, *The Semantics of Ancient Hebrew Colour Lexemes*, ANESSup 33 (Leuven, Belgium: Peeters, 2010), 33, 34, 37, 119, 174.

<span id="page-647-9"></span><span id="page-647-8"></span><span id="page-647-7"></span><sup>7</sup> The word *'erets* occurs forty-two times in Zechariah, and its exact meaning must be determined from each context. It can mean the "land" of Israel's inheritance (e.g., 3:9; 7:5; 11:6), the "land" of the nations (e.g., 5:11; 6:6; 10:10), the "earth" as opposed to the sky or heavens (5:9), or the "ground" from which plants grow (8:12). Here it is translated "earth" since it includes the abode of the "nations" (1:15; cf. 6:6–7).

<span id="page-648-15"></span><span id="page-648-10"></span><span id="page-648-1"></span>1:11–12 The "angel of the Lord" represents God and speaks for him yet is distinct from him. In Zechariah, he appears only here and in the fourth vision (3:1, 5–6). He seems to be more than simply an angel, and elsewhere is an appearance of God in human form (e.g., Judg. 6:11–23; 13:3–23). While some therefore deduce he is an appearance of the preincarnate Christ, caution is called for in making this claim since this connection is never made in the NT.

<span id="page-648-6"></span>The riders of the horses report to the angel of the Lord (and hence also to the Lord himself) that "all the earth remains at rest" (Zech. 1:11). God had promised his people "rest" and "peace" after restoration to the land (e.g., Jer. 30:10). Presumably by the end of Darius's second year the Jewish people expected release from Persian control, but this "rest" was the experience of the nations, not of God's people. This report provokes a complaint: "O Lord of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah?" (Zech. 1:12).

<span id="page-648-11"></span><span id="page-648-8"></span><span id="page-648-7"></span><span id="page-648-5"></span>As in the introduction (vv. 1–6), here the exile is portrayed as an expression of God's judgment—his "anger" or "curse," prophesied by Jeremiah as lasting seventy years (cf. Jer. 25:11–12; 29:10; Zech. 7:5). The exact beginning and end points are not clear (cf. Dan. 9:2, 24–27). The seventy years could be symbolic of a lifespan or could approximate the 70-year period between the rise of Nebuchadnezzar (605 BC) and the decree of Cyrus that the exiles could return home (539). Most likely it refers to the years of temple desolation—between its destruction in 586 BC and its rebuilding in 515 (cf. Ezra 6:15). In any case, the completion of seventy years will bring an end to God's anger and usher in his return to dwell with and bless his people.

<span id="page-648-12"></span><span id="page-648-3"></span><span id="page-648-2"></span>1:13 In response to Zechariah's lament, the Lord answers with "gracious and comforting words" to the angel, who presumably communicates these words to Zechariah in verses 14–17. Comfort brings to mind Isaiah 40, which concerns the end of exile and the coming of God to save his people.

<span id="page-648-13"></span><span id="page-648-4"></span>1:14 Like the prophet Isaiah, Zechariah is also to "cry out" (cf. Isa. 40:6). He is to proclaim God's great jealousy for Jerusalem and Zion. Although jealousy can have negative associations today, there is proper jealousy, such as between a husband and wife who have pledged to share their lives and intimacy only with each other. In the OT, God's jealousy arises from his covenant relationship with his people and describes his passion for this relationship and his willingness to defend it (cf. Ex. 20:5; 34:15; Deut. 5:9).

<span id="page-648-0"></span>"Jerusalem" and "Zion" refer essentially to the same entity, though Zion may have more of a religious connotation as the Temple Mount, while Jerusalem may have a more political nuance as the city of David.

<span id="page-648-14"></span><span id="page-648-9"></span>1:15 With the seventy years of judgment coming to an end, God's anger is shifting from his people (cf. v. 2) to the nations. Although the nations are "at ease," it should be God's people who are experiencing his blessing (cf. comment on 1:11–12). That the nations "furthered the disaster" implies that while God used nations such as

<span id="page-649-2"></span>Assyria and Babylon as his agents for the punishment on his people, these nations overstepped their role as God's agents and committed evil themselves (e.g., Isa. 10:5–15; 47:6; 54:7–8). God's judgment of the nations is the theme of the second and third visions.

<span id="page-649-6"></span><span id="page-649-3"></span>1:16 "I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy" can also be translated "I have turned to Jerusalem with mercy," and is to be understood against the backdrop of Jeremiah's seventy years of judgment coming to an end. God has turned from judgment to mercy, with many returning to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon. The phrase speaks of restored relationship. The return of the glory of the Lord to Jerusalem, which Ezekiel saw depart (cf. Ezekiel 10), is still future and requires the rebuilding of the temple, which God assures his people will happen: "My house shall be built in it." So, too, the city itself will be rebuilt: "The measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem," an image anticipating the third vision (Zech. 2:1–13).

<span id="page-649-8"></span><span id="page-649-7"></span>1:17 Zechariah is given a further word from the Lord to proclaim. The word "again" occurs four times in this verse to emphasize the future restoration of Jerusalem. "Cities" presumably refers to Jerusalem and her surrounding towns but could refer to all the "cities" or "towns" of Judah, of which Jerusalem is preeminent. They will "overflow with prosperity" (or "good things") as a result of God's return, experiencing his blessing (cf. 2:4).

<span id="page-649-9"></span><span id="page-649-5"></span><span id="page-649-1"></span>God "will again comfort Zion" (cf. comment on 1:13) and will "again choose Jerusalem." He will choose it "again" because in one sense he rejected it at the hands of the Babylonians when Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed in 586 BC (cf. 2 Kings 23:27). The language of choosing echoes Deuteronomy, where it expresses God's sovereignty in choosing the place where he will put his name (cf. Deut. 12:5; cf. Ps. 78:68–70). In Deuteronomy, this is associated also with where the tabernacle, and later the temple, will be located. The rebuilding of the temple will be a key theme of the fifth vision (Zech. 4:1–14).

#### <span id="page-649-10"></span><span id="page-649-0"></span>*Response*

Zechariah's first vision highlights several important themes. First, God's sovereignty is expressed in the heavenly horsemen who patrol the earth as his agents and report to him. These riders are a reminder that God knows what is happening in his world. Even though the nations may appear to be in control, God's purposes are firmly in hand—the nations are merely his instruments, accountable to him for their actions.

<span id="page-649-4"></span>Second, this passage highlights God's covenant faithfulness. The introduction (1:1–6) makes clear the exile was God's judgment on his people for refusing to obey his word. Yet, on account of his covenant promises, God has not turned his back on his people forever. He is jealous for them and promises to save them after the seventy years of punishment are completed.

<span id="page-650-3"></span><span id="page-650-2"></span>Third, this passage highlights God's kindness and grace. God hears the cry of his people ("How long?"), initiates a restored relationship by his mercy (v. 16), and promises to bless them abundantly (v. 17). The obedience called for in subsequent visions is to be in response to God's mercy, not in order to earn it (cf. Rom. 12:1).

<span id="page-650-6"></span>The promise of God's return to his people anticipates the coming of the Lord Jesus. While the people in Zechariah's day had been restored to Jerusalem, they still anticipated a greater restoration promised by the earlier prophets. The NT writers see the realization of this greater hope in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ—Immanuel ("God with us"). It is in Jesus that God's mercy and blessing is experienced. Christians also anticipate a greater presence of God when Jesus returns on the judgment day.

<span id="page-650-5"></span><span id="page-650-0"></span>Like the situation in Zechariah's day, many in our world seem to be "at rest" and "at ease," while God is not acknowledged for who he is. Like the angel of the Lord who cries, "How long?" (Zech. 1:12; cf. Rev. 6:10), Christians are to long for the day when Jesus will return and put things right in the world and God's kingdom will be seen in all its glory. At the present time God's people have a message to declare—the gospel, announcing Jesus' sovereign rule and his coming to judge (cf. Acts 17:30–31). Like Zechariah's message, the gospel is "gracious and comforting words" for those who are being saved, but a message of God's anger and judgment on his enemies—it is both good news and bad news!

## <span id="page-650-4"></span>ZECHARIAH 1:18–21

**18** *1* And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns! **19**And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these?" And he said to me, "These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem." **<sup>20</sup>**Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen. **21**And I said, "What are these coming to do?" He said, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it."

1Ch 2:1 in Hebrew

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-650-1"></span>The first vision ended by proclaiming God's anger with the nations who "furthered the disaster" (1:15) and by indicating that the temple would be rebuilt in Jerusalem (v. 16). The second vision develops this by portraying the nations as four horns that will be terrified and cast down by four craftsmen involved with rebuilding the temple.

This vision underscores the significance of temple building for the postexilic community in Jerusalem. As the temple is built, God will bring judgment on nations opposed to his people.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-651-13"></span><span id="page-651-10"></span>1:18–19 The introductory phrase, "And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold," introduces the third, sixth, and eighth visions as well (2:1; 5:1; 6:1). It provides a transition into the next scene Zechariah sees and underscores the visionary character of God's word coming to Zechariah. It might be translated colloquially as "I looked up—and what do you know! I saw . . ."8

A "horn" can refer to a musical instrument, a part of the temple altar, an iron fighting implement, or an animal horn. Since the horns are said to have "scattered" God's people (v. 19), it seems best to understand these horns as animal horns, which are a common image of military and political power (e.g., Deut. 33:17; 1 Sam. 2:1; Ps. 132:17; Jer. 48:25; Daniel 7–8).

<span id="page-651-14"></span><span id="page-651-6"></span><span id="page-651-4"></span><span id="page-651-2"></span>The number "four" elsewhere symbolizes north, south, east, and west (cf. Zech. 2:6) and is used symbolically, representing completeness. Hence the "four horns" (1:18) represent the surrounding nations that "scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem" (v. 19). Scattering is an agricultural image of grain husks blown by the wind as part of the threshing process. Here it refers to the exiles of the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel, driven from the land (cf. vv. 5–6, 15). Scattering as a curse for covenant disobedience is threatened in the Torah (cf. Lev. 26:33) and is found elsewhere in the prophets (e.g., Jer. 50:17–18; Ezek. 5:2, 10, 12; Joel 3:1–2). These nations have served as agents of God's judgment (cf. Zech. 1:6, 15)—primarily Assyria and Babylon, but also Egypt, Edom, Ammon, and Philistia.

<span id="page-651-12"></span><span id="page-651-8"></span><span id="page-651-7"></span><span id="page-651-5"></span><span id="page-651-1"></span>1:20–21 The phrase "the Lord showed me" (cf. vv. 7, 12) again emphasizes the divine origin of Zechariah's visions.

<span id="page-651-3"></span><span id="page-651-0"></span>The highest frequency of the term "craftsmen" in the OT is in reference to those involved in the construction (Ex. 35:35; 1 Kings 7:14) and repair (2 Kings 12:11; 22:6) of the tabernacle and temple. Significantly, Ezra 3:7 refers to those who rebuilt the temple under Zerubbabel as "carpenters" (craftsmen who worked with various media). The number "four" corresponds to the number of horns.

<sup>8</sup> Albert M. Wolters, *Zechariah*, HCOT (Leuven, Belgium: Peeters, 2014), 157.

<span id="page-652-0"></span>The craftsmen will "terrify" and "cast down the horns of the nations" (Zech 1:21). The craftsmen will do to the horns what the horns have done to the people of Israel—bring them into subjection. In the context of Zechariah's visions, the craftsmen are best understood as temple workers, who by their rebuilding will bring about the reversal promised in the first vision as God returns to judge the nations and dwell in the midst of his chosen people. This is worked out further in the next three visions.

#### *Response*

Zechariah's second vision portrays a great reversal, in which the foreign nations responsible for scattering in exile the northern and southern kingdoms will have their power removed and will no longer oppress God's people. The vision functions to underscore the importance of rebuilding the temple and God's power over the nations.

<span id="page-652-3"></span><span id="page-652-2"></span>Some see the craftsmen as powerful figures. Yet if the power to overcome the nations who have crushed and continue to oppress God's people comes from God's dwelling in the rebuilt temple, it is not necessary to see the craftsmen as powerful in themselves. Compared to mighty warriors, craftsmen may be seen as figures of weakness, and in this case there is a strange conjunction of power and weakness in the vision, with the weak overcoming the strong. This complements other aspects of Zechariah's prophecy, particularly 4:6, where the temple is said to be built not by the might and power of the governor Zerubbabel but by the Spirit of God (cf. also 9:9 and 10:5). It is also consistent with the NT theme of God choosing "what is weak in the world to shame the strong" (1 Cor. 1:27; cf. 2 Cor. 4:7). This serves as a great encouragement to do God's work today, knowing that God works powerfully in and through his people, often in spite of our inadequacies.

## <span id="page-652-4"></span><span id="page-652-1"></span>ZECHARIAH 2:1–13

2 *<sup>1</sup>* And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand! **2**Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length." **3**And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him **<sup>4</sup>** and said to him, "Run, say to that young man, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it. **5**And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the Lord, and I will be the glory in her midst.' "

1Ch 2:5 in Hebrew 2Or *he sent me after glory*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-653-4"></span>The third vision of a glorious new Jerusalem overflowing on account of God's blessing (2:1–5) serves as the basis for the imperatives that follow (vv. 6–13). These imperatives include a call for exiles in Babylon to return to Jerusalem in view of impending judgment on the nations (vv. 6–9), for the inhabitants of Jerusalem to sing and rejoice in the prospect of God's dwelling among his people (vv. 10–12), and for hostile nations to be silent before the Lord (v. 13).

The main idea of this vision is a renewed Jerusalem (and implicitly a rebuilt temple) at the center of God's plans for the blessing of Israel and of those from the nations who join themselves to him.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-653-2"></span><span id="page-653-1"></span><span id="page-653-0"></span>2:1–2 "I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold" (cf. comment on 1:18–19). Zechariah sees a "man with a measuring line in his hand" going to survey Jerusalem for its rebuilding (cf. 1:16, although the measuring instrument there is a different Hebrew term). Elsewhere in the OT, measuring is associated with building the tabernacle (e.g., Ex. 26:2, 8), Solomon's temple (e.g., 1 Kings 7:9, 11), the new temple <span id="page-654-3"></span>(Ezekiel 40–48), and the restored walls of Jerusalem (Neh. 3:11–30; Jer. 31:39). Similarly, the expression "width and . . . length" is most prominent in connection with the tabernacle (in Exodus), Solomon's temple (in 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles), and the new temple (in Ezekiel 40–48). In this vision, temple and city are to some extent merged, since God's glory is said to fill the city just as it had earlier filled the tabernacle and temple (Ex. 40:34–35; 1 Kings 8:11). This is reflected also in Zechariah 14:20–21.

<span id="page-654-14"></span><span id="page-654-2"></span>Unusually, Zechariah speaks directly to the man in his vision without any angelic mediation, creating a sense of urgency. The identity of the man is not given.

<span id="page-654-11"></span>2:3–4 The angel who had previously spoken with Zechariah to explain the visions is now present. The phrase "came forward" is better translated "was going out," since the angel is moving toward the man with the measuring line, who is going toward Jerusalem. Another angel goes out with a message for the first angel to convey to the young man, which Zechariah also hears and reports. The young man's pursuit by angels further indicates the urgency and importance of the message, as does the second angel's call to the first angel: "Run, say to that young man . . ."

<span id="page-654-10"></span>The phrase rendered "villages without walls" is difficult to translate from Hebrew. The idea from the immediate context is that the new Jerusalem will have no walls because its human and animal populations will be overflowing (cf. 1:17). This is a picture of God's blessing Jerusalem again, in contrast to the curse of the exile (cf. Jer. 33:10–11).

<span id="page-654-12"></span><span id="page-654-6"></span><span id="page-654-0"></span>2:5 Since a wall functions to protect and secure a city, the angel's call to build a city without walls would raise the question of security. God promises to be a "wall of fire all around." Fire is a common means of protection in the OT (cf. Gen. 3:24; Ex. 14:19–20, 24; Deut. 5:23–24; 2 Kings 6:17; Pss. 46; 48). A "wall of fire" would provide protection while also allowing for expansion.

<span id="page-654-9"></span><span id="page-654-7"></span><span id="page-654-1"></span>God also promises to be the "glory in her midst" (cf. Zech. 1:3, 16). In Israel's history, God's glory took up residence in the tabernacle and the temple (Ex. 40:34–35; 1 Kings 8:11). The prophet Ezekiel had a vision of God's glory departing from the temple as judgment on the nation's sin (Ezekiel 1; 8–11). Yet after Israel is punished, Ezekiel envisions God's glory returning to the temple (43:1–5). In this vision given to Zechariah, God promises his glory will return to Jerusalem; the temple and city will be merged.

<span id="page-654-13"></span><span id="page-654-8"></span><span id="page-654-5"></span><span id="page-654-4"></span>2:6–7 The word translated "Up!" can also be translated "Woe!" and often introduces a lament. Here it is a means of grabbing attention and urging the people to respond to the subsequent exhortation. In view of his return to Jerusalem, the Lord charges his people still living in exile to "flee from the land of the north," an expression, typical of Jeremiah, referring to Babylon (e.g., Jer. 3:18; 16:15; 23:8; 31:8). While Babylon lay to the east of Jerusalem, travelers to Babylon would begin their journey by heading northward, to avoid the desert that lay between the two cities.

<span id="page-655-8"></span>The phrase "I have spread you abroad" uses different vocabulary but conveys an idea similar to "scattering" in Zechariah 1:19. God's people were scattered in all directions, just as the "four winds of the heavens" blow everywhere. Indeed, Jeremiah 44:1 indicates some Jews had relocated to Egypt.

<span id="page-655-12"></span><span id="page-655-9"></span><span id="page-655-6"></span><span id="page-655-4"></span>A second imperative, "escape to Zion" (Zech. 2:7; on "Zion" cf. comment on 1:14), gives a sense of impending judgment on the nations, represented as the "daughter of Babylon."9 This expression poetically personifies the inhabitants of a land or city (cf. "daughter of Zion" in 2:10; 9:9). The expression "daughter of" also connotes identity and may function to question the identity and allegiance of Jewish people living in Babylon: to which city do they belong?

Reference to "Babylon" rather than Persia may suggest that the full realization of the earlier prophetic judgments pronounced against Babylon may still be future. Alternatively, "Babylon" may refer simply to the region (now governed by the Persians) in terms bringing to mind the exilic experience, or in terms not seen as seditious by Persia. Or "Babylon" may be symbolic of nations opposed to God (including the Persians), as it is elsewhere in the Bible (e.g., Revelation 18).

<span id="page-655-14"></span><span id="page-655-10"></span><span id="page-655-5"></span><span id="page-655-2"></span><span id="page-655-1"></span><span id="page-655-0"></span>2:8 The Hebrew of this verse is difficult. There is no evidence elsewhere that Zechariah was sent as a prophet to the nations, as might be suggested by "after *his glory* sent *me* to the nations." An alternative rendering would read, "After *glory* sent *me* to the nations that have plundered you," where "me" is God, speaking about himself. This can be understood against the background of Exodus and Ezekiel, where "glory" refers to that aspect of God's own character that compelled him to depart the defiled temple in judgment on the city and dwell with his people among the nations (cf. Ezek. 8:6; 9:3). In Exodus, God's glory is his character or name, revealed to Moses on the mountain (cf. Ex. 34:5–7), that visibly took up residence in the tabernacle (40:34–35). There is a perceived tension in God's character between his covenant mercy and love, on the one hand, and his judgment of sin, on the other. This perception is captured in the golden calf incident in Exodus 32, where God's burning anger wanted to destroy the nation, yet Moses interceded and pleaded on the basis of God's character and promises. God relented from destroying the nation, yet he still punished the people. Similarly, God punished his people for their sin many generations later when his glory departed the temple in Jerusalem and he allowed the Babylonians to destroy it. But would he again show mercy? This vision assures God's people that, in keeping with his character ("glory"), he will save them from the nations and return to dwell among them (Zech. 2:10–11). On account of his promises and purposes, they are the "apple of his eye" (cf. Deut. 32:10; Prov. 7:2). They are precious in his sight, and he will save and protect them from the nations (cf. also Ex. 19:5, where God calls his people his "treasured possession").

<span id="page-655-13"></span><span id="page-655-11"></span><span id="page-655-7"></span><span id="page-655-3"></span>2:9 "I will shake my hand over them" is a promise that God will act to judge the nations that have touched his people (cf. 1:15). There will be a great reversal—"the

<span id="page-656-1"></span>nations who plundered" God's people (2:8) will "become plunder" (v. 9). Those who were servants will be served. There are echoes here of God's salvation in the exodus, when the Israelites plundered the Egyptians (cf. Ex. 12:35–36; also Isa. 14:2). The fulfillment of this promise will underscore Zechariah's authority as a prophet (cf. Zech. 2:11; 4:9; 6:15).

<span id="page-656-15"></span><span id="page-656-14"></span><span id="page-656-12"></span><span id="page-656-10"></span><span id="page-656-6"></span><span id="page-656-2"></span>2:10 On the phrase "daughter of Zion," cf. verse 7. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are exhorted to "sing and rejoice." They are to be jubilant because of the Lord's promise to come and dwell among them (cf. comment on 1:16). The language of "dwelling" is elsewhere associated with God's presence in the tabernacle and temple (e.g., Ex. 25:8; 29:44–45; 1 Kings 6:12–13). Hence this exhortation anticipates the completion of the rebuilding of the temple and the return of God's visible glory. There is a similar exhortation to rejoice in Zechariah 9:9 when the Davidic king comes to Jerusalem (cf. also Zeph. 3:14).

<span id="page-656-18"></span><span id="page-656-9"></span><span id="page-656-5"></span><span id="page-656-0"></span>2:11 God's purpose and plan is not merely for the salvation of Israel but also for "many nations" who will "join themselves to the Lord." God's promise to Abraham includes the blessing of the nations (Gen. 12:3; 18:18; 22:18), and other prophets reiterate this, particularly Isaiah (e.g., Isa. 2:1–4; 14:1; 56:3, 6). It is also a significant theme in Zechariah (cf. Zech. 8:22–23; 14:16). To "be my people" is an immense covenant privilege (cf. Jer. 31:33).

<span id="page-656-17"></span><span id="page-656-8"></span>The phrase "in that day" occurs about twenty times across the book of Zechariah, and this is its first instance. It refers to the day when God will establish his kingdom on earth in glory, expressed here (as in 2:10) as his dwelling in the midst of his people. Fulfillment will confirm Zechariah's message (cf. comment on 2:9).

<span id="page-656-16"></span>2:12 Judah and Jerusalem have a privileged place in God's salvation plan. Judah will be the Lord's inheritance, his permanent possession. Judah is the tribe of David, and Jerusalem is the city of David and the location of the temple; the next two visions feature the future Davidic king (ch. 3) and temple (ch. 4). The phrase translated "holy land" is found only here in the OT. The land is "holy" because God will be present (cf. 2:13; 14:21; Ps. 78:54). On God's choosing Jerusalem again, cf. comment on Zech. 1:17.

<span id="page-656-11"></span><span id="page-656-4"></span>2:13 The final charge to "be silent" anticipates God's return to his people. Since the previous charge given to the inhabitants of Jerusalem was to make much noise ("sing and rejoice"), it seems best to understand "all flesh" as referring to the nations, who are to stop their raging against God and his people (cf. Psalm 2). The phrase "all flesh" also conveys a sense of impermanence or weakness in contrast to the Lord (cf. Isa. 40:6).

<span id="page-656-13"></span><span id="page-656-7"></span><span id="page-656-3"></span>Elsewhere, when God is "roused," it is to save his people and bring judgment on his enemies (e.g., Pss. 44:23; 59:5; 73:20), and this suits the context here. God's "holy dwelling" could refer to his dwelling among the exiles (cf. Zech. 2:8), "holy" by virtue of his dwelling there. Alternatively, it could refer to his heavenly abode, from which he will come to dwell with his people in Jerusalem once the temple is rebuilt.

### *Response*

<span id="page-657-3"></span><span id="page-657-2"></span>Zechariah's vision of a Jerusalem without walls, overflowing with God's blessing, finds its fulfillment in Jesus, who greatly expands the structures of Israel's faith (such as the temple, the city of Jerusalem, and the Promised Land). Jesus is the "glory" of God who "dwelt among us" (John 1:14) and brought salvation for Israel and the nations (cf. Acts 1:8; Eph. 2:13–18). In the new Jerusalem in Revelation 21– 22, temple, city, and land are merged in a way picturing the ultimate dwelling of God with his people: "I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" (Rev. 21:22).

<span id="page-657-8"></span><span id="page-657-6"></span>In the now-and-not-yet period between Jesus' first coming and the full realization of the new Jerusalem, the imperatives in Zechariah still readily apply. First, Christians are to flee from Babylon. In the Bible, "Babylon" comes to typify human opposition to God. For instance, in Revelation 18 Babylon is a seductive prostitute who deceives the nations. She represents the glitz, glamour, and attractiveness of an anti-God world, which ultimately leads only to death. Many exiles had become wealthy in Babylon and did not want to leave. Christians must flee from her or be destroyed (Rev. 18:4).

<span id="page-657-7"></span><span id="page-657-5"></span><span id="page-657-4"></span>Second, God's people are to give voice to the joy of God's advent and salvation in Jesus Christ by singing and rejoicing with one another (e.g., Acts 16:25; Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:15; Heb. 2:12; James 5:13; Rev. 5:9). Christians should be known by our joyful song. Indeed, for many, *we* are the nations sharing the salvation of Israel of which Zechariah spoke.

<span id="page-657-1"></span><span id="page-657-0"></span>Third, just as Zechariah calls on all flesh to be silent before the Lord (Zech. 2:13), God's people today are to implore people from all nations to stop rebelling against the Lord and recognize he is coming to judge. Now is the time to repent and bow down before him (cf. Psalm 2).

## ZECHARIAH 3:1–10

3 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan*<sup>1</sup>* standing at his right hand to accuse him. **<sup>2</sup>**And the Lord said to Satan, "The Lord rebuke you, O Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!

And to him he said, "Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with pure vestments." **5**And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord was standing by.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-658-6"></span><span id="page-658-2"></span>The fourth vision pictures a heavenly court scene (like Job 1–2), where the high priest Joshua is about to be accused by Satan on account of his iniquity and uncleanness. Rather than being condemned, he is wonderfully clothed, cleansed, and commissioned by God for service in the new temple (Zech. 3:1–7). This renewed priestly service anticipates the day of the Branch (Messiah), a day of forgiveness and prosperity for God's people (vv. 8–10).

<span id="page-658-7"></span>This vision highlights the problem of sin and defilement, and shows how God acts by his grace to cleanse and forgive so that his people might serve him. The vision also offers great hope for better things to come.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-658-5"></span><span id="page-658-1"></span><span id="page-658-0"></span>3:1 Joshua was a key leader in the postexilic period. As high priest he represented God's people and was responsible for ensuring their purity through sacrifice (e.g., Ex. 28:38; Lev. 16:1–17; 23:26–32). Yet Joshua is "standing before the angel of the Lord," a posture indicating coming before a judge (cf. Num. 27:2). "The angel of the Lord" is a figure representing the Lord and speaking for him (cf. comment on Zech. 1:11–12).

<span id="page-658-8"></span><span id="page-658-4"></span><span id="page-658-3"></span>"Satan" is not strictly a proper name but means "the accuser." The Hebrew is definite ("*the* Satan"), implying a title (cf. Job 1:6–12; 2:1–7). From a biblicaltheological perspective, Satan can be identified as "the devil" (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), active <span id="page-659-0"></span>since the garden of Eden, where he took the form of "the serpent" (Gen. 3:1). He stands ready "to accuse" Joshua.10 In doing this, Satan is presented as opposed to both the restoration of temple sacrifice and the Lord's return to the temple.

<span id="page-659-8"></span><span id="page-659-3"></span>3:2 Before Satan can make any accusation against Joshua or present any evidence against him, he is rebuked by the Lord. Elsewhere in the OT, forces of chaos are the commonest object of God's rebuke (e.g., Pss. 9:5; 106:9). The silencing of Satan is emphatic, and the sovereign power and purposes of God are stressed in the threefold use of the divine name and the reference to God's choice of Jerusalem (cf. Zech. 2:12 and comment on 1:17). Satan will not impede God's purposes. God will not allow him to speak.

<span id="page-659-6"></span>Joshua is described as a "brand plucked from the fire," which describes a burning or smoldering stick (cf. ESV mg.) rather than a branding implement. Here "fire" is an image of judgment by exile. The vision implies that although God has delivered Joshua, he is still charred and unclean from the experience (cf. Amos 4:11).

<span id="page-659-5"></span><span id="page-659-2"></span>3:3 In Hebrew, the adjective "filthy" when used as a noun can denote "excrement" (Deut. 23:13) or "vomit" (Isa. 28:8). These are possible grounds for Satan's accusation, as Joshua is ritually unclean and unfit for temple service.

The beginning of this vision portrays a massive problem. Given Joshua's representative role as high priest, his present condition underscores how the people still stand defiled before God, even though they have returned from exile. How can the Lord return to dwell with a people who remain unclean?

<span id="page-659-9"></span>3:4–5 A command is given to remove Joshua's filthy garments.11 "Those who were standing before him" are probably other angels in the heavenly court. Joshua is to be given "pure vestments"—clean high priestly garments required for Joshua's reinstatement as high priest. The reclothing of Joshua is symbolic of the forgiveness God announces: "Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you." "Iniquity" refers to sin and its associated guilt. No particular sin of Joshua is mentioned, but the immediate context suggests the sin associated with the exile was the cause of guilt and uncleanness for both Joshua and the people.

<span id="page-659-11"></span><span id="page-659-7"></span><span id="page-659-4"></span><span id="page-659-1"></span>Zechariah interjects and speaks into the vision (3:5; cf. 2:2). He requests that they "put a clean turban on his head" (cf. Ex. 28:39, though a different word for "turban" is used, perhaps alluding to Ezek. 21:26, where a command is given to remove the turban [same word as here] and crown from the wicked king Zedekiah before the exile—an episode seemingly in the background of Zech. 6:9–15 as well). Placing the turban on Joshua's head suggests that, after being reclothed and forgiven, Joshua is being reinstated as high priest. The angel of the Lord has observed these actions (3:5) and is reintroduced before speaking in verse 6.

<span id="page-659-10"></span><sup>10</sup> The Hebrew for "accuse" has the same root as "Satan" (*stn*).

<sup>11</sup> The Hebrew does not indicate who speaks, as it simply uses the pronoun "he." The ESV and NIV supply "the angel," but it could be that God issues the command directly, especially since the same figure also announces forgiveness later in the verse. In addition, the angel is said to be observing these things at the end of verse 5, which also suggests it is God who speaks.

Zechar iah 3:1–10 660

<span id="page-660-10"></span><span id="page-660-6"></span><span id="page-660-5"></span><span id="page-660-4"></span><span id="page-660-3"></span>3:6–7 Joshua has been cleansed and clothed and is now given a charge by the angel of the Lord. If Joshua will walk in the ways of the Lord and obey the requirements of the covenant (cf. Deut. 11:1; 28:9), God promises to grant him three responsibilities: (1) governance of the temple ("rule my house"), which includes not only management of the temple but also administration of justice (cf. Deut. 17:9–12; 19:17; Ezek. 44:15); (2) protection of the purity of the temple "courts" where the priests served (e.g., Num. 3:7–8; 18:5; 1 Chron. 23:28–32); and (3) admission to God's presence ("the right of access among those who are standing here").12 The ones "standing here" in Zechariah's vision are those standing in the divine council in God's presence. Access to God's presence was the high priest's privilege on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). Hence, the honor of serving as a high priest is conditional on Joshua's covenant faithfulness.

<span id="page-660-14"></span><span id="page-660-11"></span><span id="page-660-7"></span><span id="page-660-2"></span>3:8 Joshua's "friends" are likely his fellow priests (the word can also be translated "associates"), especially as they "sit before" him, suggesting they are in his service. As they serve in the new temple, they function as a sign that God will bring "my servant the Branch." The designation "my servant" is used elsewhere of individuals like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and even Nebuchadnezzar. It is used thirty-one times of David (twice in 2 Samuel 7), most frequently in the prophets. Its combination with the term "Branch" underscores the Davidic connection here, since "Branch" and "Shoot" refer to a future Davidic king (also Zech. 6:12).13 The image lying behind this is found in the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, who all liken the house of David to a mighty tree cut down or severed in the exile and from which new growth will flourish after the exile into something vast (Isa. 11:1; Jer. 23:5–6; 33:14–18; Ezek. 17:3–6, 22–23). This new growth is a Davidic king of humble origins associated with the coming kingdom of God with all its blessings. The image expresses continuity with the past, with the future king coming from the line of David.

<span id="page-660-8"></span>Joshua is not identified as "the Branch." Rather, as Joshua and his fellow priests go about their priestly service, they will serve as a sign that God will bring this future Davidic king. This connection between sign and reality suggests the king will have a priestly function when he comes (something that is clearer in Zech. 6:13).

<span id="page-660-15"></span><span id="page-660-13"></span><span id="page-660-12"></span><span id="page-660-9"></span>3:9 Some interpreters suggest the stone placed before Joshua is a stone for the construction of the new temple, with the seven eyes of the Lord focused on it (cf. 4:10). However, it is not clear from the immediate context that the "seven eyes" are the eyes of the Lord. Alternatively, since there is a focus on the high priest's garments in 3:4–5, the "single stone with seven eyes" (or "seven facets"; cf. ESV mg.) is more likely a gemstone. This is supported by the fact that the high priestly garments had gemstones on the ephod and breastpiece (cf. Ex. 28:9–11, 21). Aaron's turban also had a gold plate engraved with the words "Holy to the Lord" (Ex. 28:36–38).

<span id="page-660-1"></span><span id="page-660-0"></span><sup>12</sup> There is a wordplay in Hebrew: if Joshua "walks" in the ways of the Lord, he will be given "walkings among those standing here" (AT).

<sup>13</sup> The Hebrew *tsemakh* refers to "new growth" and is better translated "shoot," since a "branch" is something well established. There is no article in the Hebrew, suggesting its use as a name here ("Shoot").

<span id="page-661-0"></span>This stone set before Joshua is inscribed by God and functions as a reminder of his promise to "remove the iniquity of this land in a single day." Reference to a "single day" when iniquity is removed from the land brings to mind the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). This day is also associated here with the coming of the "Branch" or "Shoot."

<span id="page-661-6"></span><span id="page-661-4"></span><span id="page-661-3"></span>3:10 "In that day" refers to the time when God will establish his kingdom on earth in glory (cf. comment on 2:11). The description "Lord of hosts" expresses God's sovereignty and the certainty of his word coming to pass (cf. comment on 1:2–6a). The phrase "to come under his vine and under his fig tree" conveys an image of peace, prosperity, and paradise (cf. 1 Kings 4:25; Mic. 4:4). The idea of people inviting their "neighbor" or "friend" indicates a social occasion.

### <span id="page-661-1"></span>*Response*

In this fourth vision, the high priest Joshua's defiled state and Satan's accusation against him indicate he and the people are not yet fit for God's presence and blessing, even though they have returned to Jerusalem. Yet in the vision Joshua is marvelously cleansed by God's grace and clothed with clean garments in order to serve God. This offers great hope for God's people as it anticipates their own cleansing. If Joshua and his fellow priests walk in the ways of the Lord and keep his requirements (3:6–7), they will have the privilege of serving in the new temple when it is constructed, and Joshua will have access to the very presence of God. Implicit in this is the forgiveness and blessing they will mediate to God's people through their temple worship.

<span id="page-661-5"></span><span id="page-661-2"></span>The service of Joshua and his fellow priests in the temple will also function as a sign that God will send his servant, "the Branch" (cf. Jer. 23:5; 33:15). Furthermore, an inscribed stone set before Joshua serves a similar purpose. The priesthood and the stone anticipate the coming of a future Davidic king (the Messiah), at whose arrival the iniquity of the land will be removed in a single day and a day of peace, prosperity, and paradise will be ushered in. The connection of the priesthood with "the Branch" suggests the Messiah may have a priestly role when he comes (cf. Zech. 6:13). Indeed, this is the case with Jesus, who is the Great High Priest who offered the once-for-all sacrifice of his own body to cleanse his people from sin and set them free from the accusations of Satan (Heb. 9:26).

<span id="page-661-10"></span><span id="page-661-9"></span><span id="page-661-8"></span><span id="page-661-7"></span>The sequence of actions in this vision reflects a similar pattern in the Christian life. By God's grace and through the cross, Jesus cleanses and clothes his people with a righteousness not their own in order to serve God (Rom. 3:21–26; 8:33–34; 12:1). Joshua is not accepted by God on account of his good works—he is cleansed and forgiven as an undeserved act of God. Having been cleansed, he is commanded by God to serve (cf. Rom. 12:1). A failure to appreciate the grace of God's forgiveness can lead to pride, insecurity, or ongoing feelings of guilt, paralyzing Christian service. The antidote to each of these maladies is the gospel of grace. Whatever accusation Satan can bring has been silenced for those who trust in Jesus.

<span id="page-662-1"></span><span id="page-662-0"></span>Finally, the invitation of others to paradise (Zech. 3:10) issues from a restored relationship with God and the hope of heaven. Those who know the forgiveness of sins and the blessings of God should be inviting others to share it. This is why Christians proclaim Jesus as Savior and Lord.

## ZECHARIAH 4:1–14

4 And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep. **2**And he said to me, "What do you see?" I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it. **3**And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left." **4**And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" **5**Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord." **6**Then he said to me, "This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts. **7**Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of 'Grace, grace to it!' "

**<sup>8</sup>**Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, **<sup>9</sup>** "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. **10**For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-662-3"></span><span id="page-662-2"></span>The fifth vision is structured as a dialogue between Zechariah and the interpreting angel; Zechariah is questioned and asks questions about what he sees, namely a golden lampstand with various accessories. At the heart of the dialogue is a message from the Lord to Zerubbabel telling him he will build the temple by the power of God's Spirit (4:6–10). Within the dialogue, Zechariah asks three times about the two olive trees (vv. 4, 11–13). While not explicit, these "two olive trees" are best

understood as representing the prophets Zechariah and Haggai, a connection that links the vision of the golden lampstand with the word from the Lord about the certain construction of the temple.

The heart of this vision is the prophetic word in the power of God's Spirit bringing about the reconstruction of the temple.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-663-5"></span><span id="page-663-4"></span>4:1 "The angel who talked with me" (also known as the interpreting angel) had previously gone out into the visionary world (cf. comment on 2:3–4). Now he returned and "woke" (or "roused") Zechariah. The likening of this rousing to being "awakened" from sleep suggests Zechariah was not actually asleep but was being shown a vision while in a conscious state. While it is impossible to know Zechariah's exact experience, it was probably all-consuming, and Zechariah would have been left contemplating what he had seen after each vision.

<span id="page-663-6"></span><span id="page-663-3"></span><span id="page-663-2"></span>4:2–3 Zechariah now sees a gold lampstand with various accessories. The Hebrew word for "lampstand" is *menorah*, bringing to mind the golden menorah of the tabernacle or one of the ten in Solomon's temple (e.g., Ex. 25:31–40; 37:17–24; Num. 8:2; cf. 1 Kings 7:49) with tree-like qualities, evoking the garden of Eden (cf. Gen. 2:9). Fire is often associated with God's presence (e.g., Gen. 15:17; Ex. 3:2–6), suggesting the menorah with "seven lamps" represents God's presence in the temple. However, the additional elements in the vision set this menorah apart.

<span id="page-663-1"></span><span id="page-663-0"></span>The menorah in Zechariah's vision has a "bowl on the top of it" that seems to act as a receptacle for oil. Archeological discoveries of clay lamp dishes with pinched sides holding wicks have led to the translation "seven lips." However, what seems to be in view is the "all of gold" sanctuary menorah, not a clay lamp. The Hebrew is better rendered as "seven streams"—or seven "pipes" or "channels," as some translations render the phrase—which provide a mechanism for the oil to travel from the bowl to each of the seven lamps.14 Finally, there are "two olive trees" to the right and left of the bowl. Verse 12 further describes "two branches of the olive trees" and "two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out." While some of the Hebrew is difficult to translate, the impression seems to be that the two olive

<span id="page-663-7"></span><sup>14</sup> The phrase "on each of the lamps" is better translated "to each of the lamps" and has a distributive sense. However, it is difficult to know if it is one stream or pipe to each lamp, or seven to each lamp, in which case there would be forty-nine in total.

trees provide oil for the menorah through "two golden pipes," which presumably empty into the bowl and from there are further transported by the "seven streams" to each of the lamps.15 The additional elements in Zechariah's vision contrast the sanctuary menorah, which was supplied with oil by the priests. The menorah in Zechariah's vision has no need for priestly intervention.

<span id="page-664-12"></span><span id="page-664-8"></span>4:4–5 A dialogue between Zechariah and the interpreting angel ensues concerning the identity of the two olive trees (cf. also vv. 11–14). The angel's question ("Do you not know?") suggests Zechariah should have known what they represent, but his ignorance gives later readers some encouragement since we, too, often find the visions hard to understand!

<span id="page-664-9"></span>The angel then gives Zechariah two prophetic messages concerning Zerubbabel, in verses 6–7 and verses 8–10. These link the visionary world with the real.

<span id="page-664-1"></span><span id="page-664-0"></span>4:6 The first message is for Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel is listed among those who returned from Babylon, rebuilt the altar, and laid the foundation of the temple (Ezra 2:2; 3:2, 8; Neh. 12:1). He is the "governor of Judah" and the "son of Shealtiel," indicating his Davidic lineage and hence his qualification to rebuild the temple (Hag. 1:1, 14; 2:2, 21, 23; cf. 1 Chron. 3:17). In the first prophetic message, Zechariah must tell Zerubbabel the temple will be built "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit" (Zech. 4:6; cf. Ps. 33:16). Like the menorah supplied with resources outside itself, Zerubbabel will rebuild the temple in the power of God's Spirit.

<span id="page-664-10"></span><span id="page-664-6"></span><span id="page-664-5"></span><span id="page-664-4"></span><span id="page-664-3"></span>4:7 The "great mountain" seems to represent metaphorically the obstacles Zerubbabel faced in rebuilding the temple. These include hostile Samaritan authorities and the difficult spiritual and economic circumstances of the people (cf. Ezra 4; Haggai 1). God assures Zerubbabel these obstacles will be overcome (cf. the image with Isa. 40:4 and 45:2). Zerubbabel will complete the temple by bringing out and placing the "top stone" (or "capstone"), accompanied by shouts of "Grace, grace to it!" This is either a request for God to bless the building or an acclamation of God's kindness and faithfulness in keeping his promise that the temple will be rebuilt.

Some scholars argue on the basis of analogies with Mesopotamian building practices that the "top stone" is a stone removed from the ruins of the earlier temple and laid in a special ceremony as part of the new temple to provide continuity between the structures. However, the timing does not fit this suggestion. The laying of the foundation had already occurred (Hag. 2:15, 18; Zech. 4:9; 8:9), whereas this word from God says the stone will be placed in the future.16

<span id="page-664-11"></span><span id="page-664-7"></span>4:8–9 A second prophetic message for the community is an assurance that Zerubbabel will complete the temple. The statement that Zerubbabel has "laid the foundation of this house" corresponds with Ezra 3:8–13, where Zerubbabel is said

<span id="page-664-2"></span><sup>15</sup> In Hebrew, the "golden oil" is simply described by its color: "the gold." That it refers to oil is an inference from the wider context. Referring to it in this way connotes its value.

<sup>16</sup> In addition, there are fundamental differences between Mesopotamian building practices and those in Palestine, such as the use of brick rather than stone. See further Wolters, *Zechariah*, 124–128.

to have laid the foundation of the temple some twenty years earlier. In Ezra 5:16, this same work is attributed to Sheshbazzar, which probably means Zerubbabel was working under the authority of Sheshbazzar, the one mentioned in official Persian records. Alternatively, Zerubbabel's laying the foundation of "this house" could refer to a second occasion marking the recent renewal of the building work stimulated by the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah (cf. Hag. 2:15, 18; Zech. 8:9). In either case, the completion of the project by Zerubbabel will demonstrate that Zechariah is a prophet authorized by the Lord (cf. 1:16; 2:9, 11; 8:9).

<span id="page-665-9"></span><span id="page-665-5"></span><span id="page-665-4"></span>4:10 The phrase "whoever has despised the day of small things" indicates there were some in the community who were frustrated over the slow and painful progress of the rebuilding and made their frustration heard. The Lord assures the people that their present experience is only "small" compared to what lies in the future. Scorn will turn to joy when Zerubbabel completes the temple. "Plumb line" can also be translated as "chosen stone" and probably refers to the "top stone" in verse 7 that will complete the building.17 It is difficult to see how a "plumb line" would inspire joy at this point.

<span id="page-665-8"></span><span id="page-665-6"></span><span id="page-665-2"></span><span id="page-665-1"></span>The "seven" lamps (cf. v. 2) are identified as the "eyes of the Lord, which range through the whole earth." This phrase is also found in 2 Chronicles 16:9, where it refers to God's presence among his people to strengthen them (cf. also Ezra 5:5). This connects the vision of the menorah (which represents God's presence in the temple) with the message to Zerubbabel: God is with his people to strengthen them in their rebuilding project. This vision provides great encouragement to the people, who had become despondent.

<span id="page-665-11"></span><span id="page-665-10"></span><span id="page-665-7"></span>4:11–13 Zechariah asks the angel twice more about the significance of the "two olive trees" (v. 11) and "two branches of the olive trees" (v. 12). (Cf. comment on 4:2–3, where these elements are discussed.) Zechariah admits he still does not understand the significance of the olive trees in the vision (v. 13).

<span id="page-665-13"></span><span id="page-665-12"></span>4:14 The angel finally identifies the two olive trees as "two sons of new oil" (ESV mg.). This translation is preferable, as "two anointed ones" is an incorrect inference.18 The olive trees pour out oil rather than receiving it (as happens with anointing).19 While these "two" are commonly identified as Joshua and Zerubbabel, the two leaders mentioned in the fourth and fifth visions, they are better understood as the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, for the following reasons: (1) the description of their standing "by the Lord of the whole earth" indicates the prophet's privileged access to the divine council (1 Kings 22:19; Jer. 23:18–22); (2) the OT often connects the work of the Spirit with prophecy (e.g., Zech. 7:12); (3) the reconstruction of the temple is attributed to Haggai and Zechariah elsewhere

<span id="page-665-14"></span><span id="page-665-0"></span><sup>17</sup> "Chosen stone" (*ha'eben habbedil*) understands "chosen" (*habbedil*) to derive from *badal*, which means "to separate, divide," hence "to choose."

<span id="page-665-3"></span><sup>18</sup> The expression "sons of new oil" means that the olive trees produce the new oil, like the expression "sons of a flame" in the Hebrew of Job 5:7 refers to the sparks that produce a flame.

<sup>19</sup> Elsewhere, the "oil" for anointing is always the Hebrew word *shemen*. Here the word for "oil" is *yitshar*.

<span id="page-666-4"></span><span id="page-666-2"></span>(Ezra 5:1–2; 6:14–15; Zech. 8:9); (4) Revelation 11:3–4 creatively reuses this vision, depicting two prophets as olive trees; and (5) identifying them as Haggai and Zechariah connects this vision with the two prophetic messages about Zerubbabel in Zechariah 4:6–7, 8–10, where the main driving force behind the completion of the temple will be God's Spirit rousing the people to action through the preaching of his prophets. Admittedly, since the figures are never explicitly identified, it is impossible to be certain of the identity of the "two sons of new oil." However, seeing them as Haggai and Zechariah best suits the wider context of the book of Zechariah and best explains the menorah vision itself.

<span id="page-666-0"></span>This identification may also explain why Zechariah has so much difficulty understanding the identity of the two olive trees in his vision (he has to ask about them three times). Just as the prophets Moses and Jeremiah were hesitant to take on important roles (Ex. 4:10; Jer. 1:6), so Zechariah may not have fully appreciated the key role he would play as a prophet in bringing about God's purposes.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-666-5"></span><span id="page-666-3"></span><span id="page-666-1"></span>Those living in Jerusalem after returning from Babylon faced many challenges, personified in this vision as a "great mountain" (Zech. 4:7). Elsewhere these challenges are identified as financial difficulties (Hag. 1:6), opposition from the neighboring Samaritans (Ezra 4:1–6), and generally low morale (Hag. 1:14). What will enable God's people to overcome these challenges and complete the building of the temple? The answer this fifth vision gives is that God himself will do it, by his Spirit, through his prophets. Indeed, history shows that as the "two sons of oil" (Haggai and Zechariah) proclaimed God's word, God was at work by his Spirit to move the people to obey so that the temple was rebuilt.

<span id="page-666-7"></span><span id="page-666-6"></span>Crucially, since the coming of Jesus, God has built his temple—the church in exactly the same way, by the proclamation of his word in the power of his Spirit. This is captured in Ephesians 2, where God's temple is identified as the church, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus the chief cornerstone (Eph. 2:20). This implies that the message of the apostles and prophets about Jesus (that is, the gospel) is the foundation of the church, and as people hear the message of Jesus and repent and believe, they are incorporated into it. This temple comprises both Jew and Gentile now that Jesus has come. Furthermore, as in Zechariah, God is building this temple "by the Spirit" (Eph. 2:22). God's word preached (and spoken and written about) in the power of the Spirit builds the church today. It is God's Spirit at work in people's minds and hearts when they hear the gospel and respond in repentance and faith. And it is God's Spirit at work in the lives of believers as they put off sin and live fruitful lives for God.

<span id="page-666-8"></span>Just as the people in Zechariah's day faced many challenges, so does the church today. There are challenges of persecution and martyrdom and challenges of secularism, materialism, and idolatry. Just as there were scoffers in Zechariah's day, so there are those who scoff at the lack of influence and power the church displays in the world (or at the misused power it displays at times). This vision is a great <span id="page-667-4"></span><span id="page-667-3"></span>encouragement that God's word in the power of the Spirit will accomplish its purposes. It is an encouragement to preach this word even in the "day of small things," knowing that God keeps his promises: "I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18).

#### *Section Overview*

After envisioning God's return to the temple in Jerusalem in visions 1–5, visions 6 and 7 picture God's judging the wicked and driving iniquity and wickedness far from the land. Visions 6 and 7 are closely connected by structure and themes, but remain distinct.

The main idea of the sixth vision is that God will judge those who persist in breaking the national covenant but have as yet gone unpunished.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-667-1"></span><span id="page-667-0"></span>5:1–2 "Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold" (cf. comment on 1:18–19). Zechariah sees a "flying scroll." Scrolls are generally associated with God's written Word (cf. Ps. 40:7; Jeremiah 36; Ezekiel 2–3). This scroll is extraordinary in its activity and dimensions—it is approximately 33 by 16.5 feet (10 by 5 m), so that as it flies it is clear for all to see, like a huge banner. The dimensions also suggest the scroll is only partially unfurled, perhaps revealing a column of text. Some scholars <span id="page-668-11"></span>suggest the dimensions reflect those of the vestibule of the temple or a domestic house, but these connections seem coincidental rather than intentional. God is later identified as the one who sent out this flying scroll (Zech. 5:4), suggesting it does his work without human agents such as priests, who were responsible for teaching God's ways to the people (e.g., Lev. 10:11; Deut. 33:10; Jer. 18:18; Ezek. 7:26; Hag. 2:11) and for providing rulings at the temple for those who sought justice (e.g., Deut. 17:8–12; 19:17; Mal. 2:6–7).

<span id="page-668-10"></span><span id="page-668-7"></span><span id="page-668-6"></span><span id="page-668-4"></span><span id="page-668-2"></span><span id="page-668-1"></span>5:3 Equating the scroll with the "curse" suggests the scroll represents the "Book [scroll] of the Law of Moses" (Josh. 8:31, 34; 23:6; cf. Ex. 24:4, 7; 1 Kings 2:3; Dan. 9:11). While the crimes of stealing and swearing falsely are often understood as representative crimes of the Decalogue, the different vocabulary used for these crimes and the lack of specific curses for disobedience within the Decalogue strongly suggest the scroll contains much more than the Ten Commandments, instead representing the "Law of Moses" more broadly, perhaps as a form of the scroll of Deuteronomy. The "Law of Moses" includes covenant curses for disobedience (e.g., Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28–29).

<span id="page-668-3"></span>The Hebrew indicates these crimes have thus far gone unpunished (translating "everyone who steals *has been acquitted*" and "everyone who swears falsely *has been acquitted*" rather than "shall be cleaned out"). The failure (presumably by the priests) to judge these crimes within the community of God's people indicates there has been a corruption of justice. These crimes are singled out likely because they were the ones negatively impacting the postexilic community (cf. Zech. 7:8–12; 8:17). God has sent the scroll to put things right and to ensure that the guilty will not be acquitted, an action consistent with his character as the God "who will by no means clear the guilty" (Ex. 34:7; cf. Ex. 20:7).

<span id="page-668-12"></span><span id="page-668-9"></span><span id="page-668-0"></span>5:4 In contrast to God's "house" (the temple), to be built in accordance with the earlier visions (cf. 1:16; 3:7; 4:9), the curse of the scroll will enter and completely destroy the houses of the guilty, "both timber and stones." This implies the death of the inhabitants of the houses (cf. with the curse on covenant breakers in Deut. 30:15). Normally a house provides refuge, but here it brings destruction.

<span id="page-668-5"></span>It is possible also to read God's action in the past tense: "I have sent it out," especially since the scroll is already flying in Zechariah's vision. This gives readers and hearers of Zechariah assurance that God's justice is coming soon.

## *Response*

<span id="page-668-8"></span>Zechariah's vision of a giant flying scroll represents the curse of the law of Moses going out over the land to bring punishment to all who have violated its terms with impunity. It functions in two ways in the book of Zechariah. First, it comforts those who have been sinned against by perpetrators not brought to justice. It assures them God will be true to his word and bring punishment on them. Second, it warns those who continue to sin that they need to repent (cf. 1:3; <span id="page-669-5"></span>7:8–10). In the vision, the curse of the scroll has gone out—his judgment is certain and imminent.

<span id="page-669-8"></span><span id="page-669-7"></span><span id="page-669-6"></span>This vision reminds Christians of the curse of the law that fell on Jesus (Gal. 3:13). He has freed us from sin's consequences by becoming a curse for us. Yet, for all who reject Jesus as Lord and seem to get away with it in this life, this vision reminds us of another scroll in the hands of the risen Lord Jesus (cf. Rev. 5:9). As the seals of this scroll are opened, judgment will fall on his enemies, climaxing in the great day of God's wrath from which there is no hiding (Rev. 6:12–17).

## <span id="page-669-4"></span>ZECHARIAH 5:5–11

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-669-3"></span><span id="page-669-2"></span><span id="page-669-0"></span>With close connections to the previous vision, the seventh vision pictures wickedness being removed from the land and transported to Babylon. The vision contains direct allusions to Ezekiel 1–11, where the Lord departs from his temple in Jerusalem on a throne chariot attended by winged creatures riding on the wind. He departed due to iniquity (Ezek. 4:4, ESV mg.), wickedness (Ezek. 3:18–19; 5:6), and idolatry (Ezekiel 8), and his departure meant the destruction of the city and temple and exile of the people. With the Lord's return to Jerusalem portrayed in visions 1–5, this vision portrays the removal of iniquity, wickedness, and idolatry—an "anti-ark" borne by "anti-cherubs" is put in an "anti-temple" and transported to an "anti-Jerusalem."20

## *Comment*

<span id="page-670-9"></span><span id="page-670-6"></span><span id="page-670-4"></span>5:5 "The angel who talked with me" (also known as the interpreting angel; cf. 1:14; 4:6) shows Zechariah another visionary object ("Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out"). The movement "out" is significant. In the first five visions the temple is rebuilt, anticipating the Lord's return *to* Jerusalem. The opposite movement is reflected in these last two visions, where all that opposes the Lord is destroyed and driven *out from* the land (5:3, 5–6).21

<span id="page-670-10"></span><span id="page-670-8"></span><span id="page-670-2"></span><span id="page-670-0"></span>5:6 Rather than reporting what he sees, as in earlier visions, here Zechariah simply asks, "What is it?" The angel replies, "This is the basket that is going out." The Hebrew for "basket" is *'ephah*, a unit of measure for grain or flour and, by extension, the measuring vessel itself. The material of an ephah could be ceramic or woven reed. It is thought to be about 6 gallons (22 l) and is used elsewhere in worship and commerce (e.g., Lev. 5:11; 19:36). It appears in a number of passages in injunctions to use a "just" or "honest" ephah (e.g., Deut. 25:14–15; Prov. 20:10; Mic. 6:10). In Zechariah's vision it represents "their iniquity in all the land."22 "Iniquity" refers to sin and its associated guilt and can extend also to its punishment. In Zechariah 3:4, "iniquity" refers to the guilt of the high priest Joshua, taken away as he was reclothed. Here in 5:6 the "land" refers to the land of the people of Judah, contrasted with the "land of Shinar" in verse 11.

<span id="page-670-14"></span><span id="page-670-11"></span><span id="page-670-5"></span><span id="page-670-3"></span>5:7 Concealed in the basket is a woman. The "leaden cover" can also be translated "talent of lead," a "talent" being a unit of currency or weight (about 66 lb./30 kg). It does not seem to refer to a "cover," as the "leaden weight" (or "leaden stone") in verse 8 uses a different term. Instead, the "talent of lead" is lifted out of the basket and identified as a woman, namely a statuette idol.23 In Hebrew the phrase "talent of lead" (*kikkar ʻoferet*) seems like a word-play with "mercy seat" (*kapporet*), which covered the ark of the covenant. Whereas the Lord was enthroned on the mercy seat, the woman is "enthroned" in the basket, portrayed as an anti-ark, which becomes clearer as the vision is elaborated.

<span id="page-670-12"></span>5:8 The woman-idol represents "wickedness" (*harishʻah*), in Hebrew a near anagram for "Asherah," a foreign god worshiped by Israelites until the Babylonian exile

<span id="page-670-13"></span><span id="page-670-7"></span><sup>21</sup> The Hebrew also says the interpreting angel "went out" (v. 1) rather than "came forward." He speaks to Zechariah on his way to the basket that is "going out." Similarly the two women in verse 9 "were going out" rather than "coming forward."

<sup>22</sup> The translation "their iniquity" (ESV) follows the Septuagint and Syriac rather than the Hebrew Masoretic Text. The Hebrew has "their eye," but it is difficult to make sense of this, and the difference would be a simple copyist error (writing the letter *yod* [י [instead of *waw* [ו([.

<span id="page-670-15"></span><span id="page-670-1"></span><sup>23</sup> In Hebrew the woman is described as "one woman." This may be an echo of the Shema (Deut. 6:4; Zech. 14:9) to indicate the woman-idol is an anti-god figure.

<span id="page-671-4"></span>(2 Kings 23:4, 6–7). After revealing her identity, the interpreting angel restrains the woman-idol in the basket with a "leaden weight" so that she cannot escape.

<span id="page-671-10"></span><span id="page-671-7"></span>5:9 The visionary scene continues with "two women coming forward" with "wind . . . in their wings," an expression indicating flight (cf. Ezek. 1:11–12). Their wings are "like the wings of a stork"—a large bird with powerful wings known for its yearly northward migration from the land of Judah (cf. Jer. 8:7). The expression "between earth and heaven" refers to the sky.

<span id="page-671-11"></span><span id="page-671-5"></span><span id="page-671-1"></span>5:10–11 The basket is transported "to the land of Shinar," the country of God's enemies also known as Babylonia (cf. 2:7; Gen. 11:2). Here a house is built for the basket and it is set up like an idol.

<span id="page-671-6"></span>There are many elements of this vision suggesting the basket is a parody of the ark of the covenant (cf. Ezekiel 1; 8–11). In addition to the "leaden cover" sounding like "mercy seat" in Hebrew and the woman-idol being enthroned in the basket, the two cherubim of the ark are paralleled by the two women with stork-like wings. As God's house is built in Jerusalem and he returns (visions 1–5), wickedness is carried far away and a house is built for it.

## *Response*

<span id="page-671-2"></span>This vision promises the eradication from the land of all that is opposed to God and his good purposes. Wickedness will be sent back to where it belongs. There is also an echo of the Day of Atonement ritual in Leviticus 16, when, after the temple is cleansed (cf. Zechariah 3–4), the scapegoat bearing the sins of the people is sent far away (Lev. 16:22).

<span id="page-671-9"></span><span id="page-671-3"></span>This vision points to the second coming of Jesus. In his first coming, Jesus' death on the cross won forgiveness and cleansing from sin. When he returns and the final judgment takes place, iniquity, wickedness, and idolatry will be eradicated from the world. He will remove from his presence all who reject him and thereby continue in wickedness, and they will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction (cf. 2 Thess. 1:6–10). The response this vision calls for is repentance and obedience to Jesus.

<span id="page-671-12"></span><span id="page-671-8"></span><span id="page-671-0"></span>In the Bible, "Shinar" or "Babylon" comes to represent proud human ingenuity and skill expressed in opposition to God, as at the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11 (cf. Response section on Zech. 2:1–13). In Revelation 17, Babylon is a prostitute that seduces people with her glamour, but who in the end turns out to be a hideous beast that only destroys. A great threat for Christians today is the same as it was in Zechariah's day: the seductiveness of the wickedness and idols of the Babylon of our age. God's people must see through this deception and resist.

6 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. **2**The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, **<sup>3</sup>** the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong.*<sup>1</sup>* **<sup>4</sup>**Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" **5**And the angel answered and said to me, "These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. **6**The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country." **7**When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. **8**Then he cried to me, "Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country."

1Or *and the fourth chariot strong dappled horses*

#### *Section Overview*

The final vision rounds out the sequence of eight night visions by echoing several themes of the earlier visions. The presence of horses matches the first vision, though their role is different here. The second and third visions speak of the coming destruction of the nations, particularly Babylon ("the north country"). In this final vision, "the north country" is finally judged (6:8).

<span id="page-672-4"></span>The central idea of the final vision is that God will subdue hostile nations with his heavenly army, setting the world aright.

	- 2. The Vision Explained (6:4–8)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-672-2"></span><span id="page-672-1"></span><span id="page-672-0"></span>6:1 Now Zechariah sees "four chariots." Chariots were primarily military vehicles used in open country for rapid flanking movements or for pursuing an enemy. They often carried an archer and shield-bearer. Chariots also symbolize the power of kingship (e.g., Gen. 41:43; 1 Kings 1:5), and were often associated with the divine in ancient Near Eastern thought. The number four seems to represent the scope of their mission to "patrol the earth," namely its four corners (Zech. 6:7; cf. 1:19–20).

<span id="page-673-11"></span>The chariots "came out from between two mountains." It is impossible for earthly chariots to travel on mountains like this, indicating these are not normal chariots. Rather, they are chariots from God's presence (6:5). They are the host (army) of the Lord of hosts. The "mountains of bronze" are best understood as the entrance to the heavens. Solomon's temple, which represented the heavens in its layout (cf. Heb. 8:5), had two bronze pillars at its entrance (1 Kings 7:15–22).

<span id="page-673-8"></span><span id="page-673-0"></span>6:2–3 Each chariot has different-colored horses, though no significance is given to the colors (cf. the horse colors with the first vision; not all are the same).24 Pictures and models from this period show chariots drawn by two to four horses, but the number is not stated here. All the horses are "strong" or valiant (v. 3, also v. 7).

<span id="page-673-10"></span><span id="page-673-9"></span><span id="page-673-4"></span>6:4–5 Zechariah's question, "What are these, my lord?" (v. 4), repeats earlier questions (1:9; 4:4) and shows the visions are all related.

There are some translation issues in verse 5. First, the chariots are said to travel "to the four winds of heaven," which is difficult to explain. A closer rendering of the Hebrew *likens* the four chariots to "four winds of heaven." As a descriptor, it suggests the chariots are swift and have wide-ranging movements, or that they ride the winds (cf. Ps. 104:4). In addition, the word for "winds" can also be translated "Spirit," which, like Zechariah 4:6, indicates God's purposes are accomplished by his Spirit. The directions the chariots travel are then given in 6:6–8.

<span id="page-673-13"></span><span id="page-673-6"></span><span id="page-673-2"></span><span id="page-673-1"></span>Second, the chariots are said to go out from God's presence (the heavenly court) "after presenting themselves before the Lord"—they go out as his army. This is certainly true, but the Hebrew is better rendered such that the chariots go out "on account of the taking of a stand against the Lord of the whole earth."25 The phrase is similar to Psalm 2:2, which refers to the rebellion of the nations against the Lord and his anointed. This translation gives a reason for the chariots' mission: the rebellion of the nations against God. This well suits the wider and immediate contexts.

<span id="page-673-12"></span><span id="page-673-7"></span><span id="page-673-5"></span>6:6 Two chariots (the ones with the black and the white horses) go "toward the north country." This phrase is used by the prophet Jeremiah typically to refer to Babylon, where God's people had been taken as captives (cf. comment on 2:6–7) and where the woman in the basket had been taken in the previous vision ("Shinar"; 5:11). Historically, this is where the most devastating opposition to God's people had originated, which may explain the need for two chariots. The chariot with the dappled horses travels "south," perhaps against Edom and/or Egypt. Some translations add horses going to the east and west, but this is unnecessary. There is no need to travel elsewhere—to the east is desert and to the west is the sea. The fourth chariot, with red horses, is possibly held in reserve.

<span id="page-673-3"></span><sup>24</sup> As with 1:8, the color "red" can also be translated "chestnut." "Dappled" refers to "Speckles, spots, or patches," which likely are "white" or "light" in color (cf. Hartley, *Semantics of Ancient Hebrew Colour Lexemes*, cited above, note 6).

<sup>25</sup> For this translation see Max Rogland, "Heavenly Chariots and Earthly Rebellion in Zechariah 6," *Bib* 85 (2014): 117–123.

<span id="page-674-10"></span><span id="page-674-9"></span><span id="page-674-8"></span><span id="page-674-4"></span>6:7–8 The horses and chariots go out at God's command to "patrol the earth" (v. 7). Whereas the horses in the first vision were involved in surveillance on behalf of the Lord, these horses and chariots subdue the nations as his heavenly army and are an expression of his sovereignty over all the earth. In the first vision, the report was that "all the earth remains at rest" (1:11) while God's people do not, and God announced he was coming to reverse this situation. This final vision pictures the Lord's heavenly army bringing judgment on the nations, particularly Babylon, with the result that God's Spirit is set at rest (6:8). God's "Spirit" (*ruakh*) can also be translated as "wind" (cf. the "four winds" in 6:5, using the same word) and could also refer to his anger or wrath (e.g., Judg. 8:3; Prov. 16:32; Eccles. 10:4). Elsewhere God's anger is said to "rest" upon his people for their sins (e.g., Ezek. 13:13; 16:42; 21:17). In this case, God's anger will rest upon his enemies, particularly those in the north country. The word "rest" also brings to mind promises for the realization of God's kingdom (e.g., Deut. 12:10; 2 Sam. 7:1, 11; 2 Chron. 6:41).

<span id="page-674-5"></span>This final vision assures God's people that the Lord is sovereign over all nations and his purposes will prevail. The primary response it elicits is repentance and faith. In the wider sequence of visions, this specifically involves returning from exile (Zech. 2:6–8), rebuilding Jerusalem (1:17; 2:4), rebuilding the temple (1:16; 4:7–10), singing and rejoicing (2:10), and covenant obedience (3:7; 5:4, 8). This passage calls Christian readers today to exhibit similar trust—to live joyfully in obedience to Jesus and be devoted to building his temple, the church.

<span id="page-674-12"></span><span id="page-674-11"></span><span id="page-674-6"></span>The book of Revelation draws on the horse imagery of Zechariah's first and last visions. In Revelation 6:1–8, four colored horses ride out to bring judgment on the earth as the Lamb progressively opens seals of the scroll in his hand. These judgments are evidence of God's present activity in the world and point to his final judgment. Christians are assured that God has all things in hand, no matter how out of control our world might appear. There is also a challenge to followers of Jesus not to grow complacent or get comfortable and secure in a world coming to judgment. Revelation 19:11–16 also develops this imagery in the Lord Jesus' and the armies of heaven's riding white horses and striking down rebellious nations. Like Zechariah's final vision, Christ's certain victory gives courage to God's people today and inspires obedience to his word.

## <span id="page-675-1"></span>ZECHARIAH 6:9–15

**<sup>9</sup>**And the word of the Lord came to me: **<sup>10</sup>** "Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah. **11**Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. **12**And say to him, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, "Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: for he shall branch out from his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord. **<sup>13</sup>** It is he who shall build the temple of the Lord and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne.

### *Section Overview*

Zechariah is to perform a symbolic action and speak to the high priest, Joshua. It is the first of three sign-actions in the book (the others are in ch. 11). To make a crown and set it on Joshua's head looks beyond the completion of Zerubbabel's temple to the coming Branch (or "Shoot") and the temple he will build. The passage transitions from the situation in Zechariah's day to the future Davidic king's coming to establish the kingdom that the visions anticipate. Its purpose is to generate faith, obedience, and hope among those who read it.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-675-2"></span><span id="page-675-0"></span>6:9–11 Zechariah is told to "take from the exiles." It is not clear until verse 11 that he is to take "silver and gold." The exiles are named, suggesting they were well Zechar iah 6:9–15 676

<span id="page-676-8"></span>known in the community. As returnees "from Babylon," they have heeded the call to "flee from the land of the north" (2:6). Many exiles returned from Babylon with wealth (cf. Ezra 2:68–69).

<span id="page-676-13"></span><span id="page-676-10"></span><span id="page-676-9"></span><span id="page-676-2"></span>Zechariah is to use the "silver and gold" to "make a crown" (Zech. 6:11).26 He is then to symbolically crown the high priest, Joshua (cf. comment on 3:1). Joshua featured centrally in the fourth vision (ch. 3), where he was cleansed, clothed, and commissioned to serve in the rebuilt temple. Joshua and his fellow priests also serve as a sign of the coming "Branch" (or "Shoot"). In the exile, the Davidic king was removed from the throne and his crown defiled in the dust (Ps. 89:39; Jer. 22:24–30; Ezek. 21:26–27). This new crown is placed on the high priest possibly in order to sanctify it in preparation for a future king to wear without defiling it.

<span id="page-676-14"></span><span id="page-676-11"></span><span id="page-676-4"></span>6:12 Zechariah is to speak to Joshua, who also represents the future "Branch" (or "Shoot") in this symbolic action (cf. comment on 3:8 concerning the messianic significance of this title).

The "Branch . . . shall branch out from his place"—this reflects a wordplay in Hebrew, which can also be translated, "Shoot . . . will shoot up in his place." The statement implies the Shoot will take the place of Joshua and claim his rightful crown, presumably as a legitimate descendant of David ("his place").27 In addition, when he comes, the future king "shall build the temple of the Lord" (this is repeated at the beginning of 6:13 for emphasis and possibly in contrast to Zerubbabel). Temple building is the task of a Davidic king (cf. 2 Samuel 7). However, the temple the future Davidic king will build will be much greater than Zerubbabel's. It is the eschatological temple of which the earlier prophets spoke (e.g., Isa. 2:2–4; Jer. 3:16–18; Ezekiel 40–42; Mic. 4:1–5). This eschatological temple is also anticipated in Zechariah 14.

<span id="page-676-17"></span><span id="page-676-15"></span><span id="page-676-12"></span><span id="page-676-5"></span><span id="page-676-0"></span>While some scholars argue Zerubbabel was the Branch, this is problematic. First, this is unstated in the text of Zechariah. Second, many of the descriptions of the Branch in 6:13 were never realized for Zerubbabel. Nor did Zerubbabel bring in the day of peace and prosperity associated with the Branch in 3:8–10. Lastly, Zechariah's claiming this would have posed great problems for his authenticity as a prophet when such a key prophecy failed to take place. Instead, the Branch (Shoot) is a future Davidic king beyond Zerubbabel, and the crown functions to anticipate his coming.

<span id="page-676-6"></span>6:13 The Branch (Shoot) will "bear royal honor" (or "be clothed with majesty"; NIV)—a status appropriate for a king (cf. Jer. 22:18). Furthermore, he "shall sit and rule on his throne," echoing Jeremiah 22:30, where these things are denied

<span id="page-676-16"></span><span id="page-676-7"></span><span id="page-676-3"></span><sup>26</sup> The Hebrew for "crown" is plural, leading some scholars to argue two crowns are made. However, the context indicates only one crown is in view, especially since a singular verb is used in verse 14 with "the crown" as its subject (cf. Job 31:36, where the same plural form refers to a single crown). Perhaps the plural form indicates a composite crown made of gold and silver rings.

<span id="page-676-1"></span><sup>27</sup> The expression translated "from his place" refers in more than eighty other instances to a king's son taking his father's place as king (e.g., 2 Sam. 10:1; 2 Chron. 1:8).

<span id="page-677-5"></span>to King Jehoiachin and his immediate offspring because of his sin. Straight after this, Jeremiah 23:5 prophesies the coming of the "righteous Branch," who will do what is just and right—a hope reaffirmed here.

<span id="page-677-6"></span><span id="page-677-2"></span><span id="page-677-1"></span>Commentators debate whether the next phrase—"There shall be a priest on his throne"—refers to the hope of Jeremiah for a Levitical priest accompanying the Davidic Branch (cf. Jer. 33:17–22) or to the Branch functioning also as a priest— "He will be a priest on his throne" (cf. ESV mg.). In Hebrew, the Branch is the most natural subject of "he will be," but if the Branch is also a priest, why does the verse refer to "them both"? Psalm 110 seems to be the conceptual background for this verse. In this psalm, the Messiah sits by the Lord's throne (v. 1) to rule (vv. 2–3) and is designated a priest in the order of Melchizedek (v. 4; cf. Heb. 5:1–10; 6:20–8:2). If this idea of a priest-king is the background, Zechariah is saying the reign of the Lord and his Messiah ("them both") will issue in "peace" (Hb. *shalom*). In this case, Jeremiah's hope for a priest and king is merged into the one figure, a co-regent with the Lord.

<span id="page-677-3"></span><span id="page-677-0"></span>6:14 After the symbolic action is performed, Zechariah is to give the crown to the returned exiles for safekeeping in Zerubbabel's temple. There it will function as a "reminder" or memorial of what these men have done. Elsewhere, memorials function as a testimony to the Lord (e.g., Ex. 28:29; 30:16; Num. 10:9–10)—the crown in the presence of the Lord in the temple assures the people that his plans to send the Branch will come to pass (cf. the symbols of Zech. 3:8–9).

<span id="page-677-12"></span><span id="page-677-11"></span><span id="page-677-10"></span>It is not clear why two of the names in 6:14 are different from those in verse 10. Perhaps they are alternative nicknames, or are changed to reflect a new meaning; for instance, "Hen" means "grace" and may refer to the kindness of the son of Zephaniah. Perhaps they are simply different individuals. We do not have enough information to be sure.

<span id="page-677-13"></span><span id="page-677-9"></span><span id="page-677-8"></span>6:15 The ones "far off" may be Gentiles (cf. 2:11; 8:20–23; 14:16–19), but they are more likely Jewish exiles living in foreign lands (cf. 6:10 and 2:6). They will come to help complete Zerubbabel's temple and thereby authenticate Zechariah's message. Since the temple was completed by the time the book of Zechariah was finished, it assures future readers and hearers that other aspects of his message will come to pass as well (such as the coming Branch and the peace he will bring) and functions as a call to obedience.

### *Response*

<span id="page-677-15"></span><span id="page-677-14"></span><span id="page-677-7"></span><span id="page-677-4"></span>This sign-action and the word accompanying it reiterate the hope of the earlier prophets for an ideal future king, the Branch or Messiah, who is instrumental in God's coming kingdom (Isa. 11:1; Jer. 23:5–6; 33:14–18; Ezek. 17:3–6, 22–23; 21:26–27). This hope is developed further in Zechariah 9–14. Christians see these hopes fulfilled in Jesus, the one for whom the descriptions of the Branch are true: he is "the man" of prophetic expectation (Matt. 11:3–6; Mark 8:27–30; John 19:5); a descendant of David (Matt. 1:1; Rom. 1:3; Rev. 5:5); the builder of the temple,

<span id="page-678-5"></span><span id="page-678-4"></span><span id="page-678-3"></span><span id="page-678-2"></span>namely his church (Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 3:16–17; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:17–22; Heb. 3:3; 1 Pet. 2:5); the one who bears royal honor (Matt. 25:31; Acts 2:34–36; Heb. 1:3; 2:9; Rev. 19:12); the one who as Messiah is seated at God's right hand (Matt. 26:64; Acts 2:33; 5:31; Rom. 8:34; Col. 3:1); the one who as priest has provided cleansing for sin and sat down at the right hand of God's throne (Heb. 1:3; 5:10; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2; 1 Pet. 3:22); and the one whose "counsel" with his Father has brought peace (Eph. 2:14–18).

<span id="page-678-8"></span><span id="page-678-7"></span><span id="page-678-6"></span><span id="page-678-1"></span><span id="page-678-0"></span>Now that Messiah Jesus has come, he calls his followers to build his temple, the church, in anticipation of his return. The fact that so many of these promises have been fulfilled gives Christians even greater assurance that he is faithful to keep all his promises and underscores the challenge to diligently obey his voice (cf. Zech. 1:3).

## ZECHARIAH 7:1–14

7In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. **2**Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to entreat the favor of the Lord, **<sup>3</sup>** saying to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts and the prophets, "Should I weep and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?"

**<sup>4</sup>**Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me: **<sup>5</sup>** "Say to all the people of the land and the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted? **6**And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? **7**Were not these the words that the Lord proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?' "

**<sup>8</sup>**And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying, **<sup>9</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another, **10**do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in your heart." **11**But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.*<sup>1</sup>* **<sup>12</sup>**They made their hearts diamondhard lest they should hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the Lord of hosts. **<sup>13</sup>** "As I*<sup>2</sup>* called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear," says the Lord of hosts, **<sup>14</sup>** "and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate."

## *Section Overview*

<span id="page-679-4"></span><span id="page-679-3"></span>The dating formula in 7:1 marks a new section of the book (cf. 1:1 and 1:7). Chapters 7–8 form a transition between chapters 1–6 and 9–14. Since the question asked at the beginning of chapter 7 is directly addressed only at the end of chapter 8, the chapters must be seen as closely connected. They will be treated separately here simply for ease of presentation.

A delegation from Bethel poses a question to the religious leaders in Jerusalem about the need to continue fasting. This provides an occasion for Zechariah to reapply important covenant requirements to the people and restate the hope for restoration. Zechariah calls the people to covenant obedience in view of God's just judgment of the past sins of the "fathers." This chapter challenges us concerning the way we treat others, particularly the vulnerable, and warns of the danger of religious hypocrisy.

#### *Comment*

7:1 A third and final dating formula introduces this section (cf. 1:1, 7 and comments). Now Darius is titled "King," subtly reminding the readers and hearers that even though the temple reconstruction is under way (and was completed by the time the book of Zechariah was written), the people of God are still living under a foreign power. The "fourth year of King Darius . . . on the fourth day of the ninth month" is December 7, 518 BC. This is almost two years after the night visions of chapters 1–6 and two years before the temple is completed (cf. Ezra 6:14–16). "Chislev" is a Babylonian month name (cf. comment on Zech. 1:7).

Before the exile it was part of the northern kingdom (1 Kings 12:29–33; Hos. 10:15; Amos 3:14), but afterward it appears to have been part of Judah (Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32). A delegation headed by Sharezer and Regem-melech is sent by the people of Bethel "to entreat the favor of the Lord," that is, to seek God's favor in the aftermath of the exile. This is a foretaste of what other cities will do in Zechariah 8:20–21.

<span id="page-679-8"></span><span id="page-679-7"></span>7:3 As part of seeking the Lord's favor, the delegation also seeks an answer to an important question from the religious leaders in Jerusalem (the temple priests and the prophets). The priests were responsible for instructing the people in the Torah <span id="page-680-1"></span><span id="page-680-0"></span>(e.g., Deut. 31:9; Hag. 2:11; Mal. 2:6–7) and determining God's will (e.g., Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21; Deut. 33:8). The prophets were also responsible for giving guidance in God's ways. Interestingly, it is the prophet Zechariah who answers the delegation's question. Reference to more than one prophet ("prophets") suggests the presence of Haggai also, though he is not named here (but cf. Ezra 6:14).

<span id="page-680-15"></span><span id="page-680-12"></span><span id="page-680-5"></span><span id="page-680-2"></span>The delegation's question concerns the need to continue to "weep and abstain in the fifth month." The verb "weep" is often associated with penitence and lamentation over sin and seeking God's favor (e.g., 2 Sam. 12:21–22). In the context of Zechariah 7:5, it is clear that "abstain" refers to fasting. Fasting "in the fifth month" is one of the four fasts mentioned in 8:19, and this one is believed to recall Nebuchadnezzar's destruction of the temple in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:8–9). With the temple reconstruction in Jerusalem nearing its completion, it was appropriate for the delegation to ask if they must continue to mourn and fast in Bethel. If God has turned to his people with mercy (Zech. 1:16), why the continued need to fast?

<span id="page-680-11"></span><span id="page-680-10"></span><span id="page-680-4"></span>7:4–5 The word of God that comes to Zechariah in response to the delegation's question cuts to the heart of their motives. The prophet poses a series of three questions "to all the people of the land and the priests" (v. 5)—their question has implications beyond the city of Bethel.

<span id="page-680-8"></span><span id="page-680-3"></span>The first question of Zechariah extends also to the fast of the "seventh" month, which apparently commemorated the assassination of Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar appointed governor (2 Kings 25:25). The reference to seventy years is to the time of exile and temple desolation prophesied by Jeremiah (Jer. 25:11–12; 29:10; cf. Zech. 1:12).28 God asks, "Was it for me that you fasted?" (7:5). This question challenges the people about their motives in fasting. Fasting without obedience to God is hypocritical (Isa. 58:3–6).

<span id="page-680-13"></span><span id="page-680-9"></span><span id="page-680-7"></span>7:6 A second question asks if they eat and drink (presumably at their religious festivals, such as Passover, Weeks, Booths/Tabernacles) for God or for their own benefit. The implication of the question is that their motives have been selfish and insincere.

<span id="page-680-14"></span><span id="page-680-6"></span>7:7 A third question asks if their behavior is consistent with the words the Lord proclaimed by the former prophets. As in 1:4, the expression "former prophets" here refers to prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel who proclaimed that a relationship with God and obedience to his word is more important than religious ritual (e.g., Isa. 1:10–11; 58:3–6; Jeremiah 7; Joel 2:12–13; Mic. 6:6–8). The delegation had asked about fasting, and Zechariah reminds them that the Lord is much more interested in relationship and obedience to his word. The words of the "former prophets" are still very relevant.

Zechariah reminds the people of an earlier time, "when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous," a time that was lost because the people refused to listen to

<sup>28</sup> The seventy years may represent a lifetime, or the period between the destruction and reconstruction of the temple—it was destroyed in 586 BC and the rebuilding was completed in 515.

<span id="page-681-11"></span><span id="page-681-3"></span>God's word proclaimed by the "former prophets" (cf. Zech. 1:4). The prosperity was also shared by "her cities around her" and further afield. The "South" (or "Negeb") was located about 50 miles (80 km) south of Jerusalem. It was used for grazing and agriculture and was also an important trade route. Under Solomon, Israelite control extended through this region (1 Kings 9:26). The "lowland" (or "Shephelah") refers to the tract of low hills between the high central ranges of Judea and the coastal plains. Zechariah implies that these regions are not inhabited as they were in preexilic times, and that the need for obedience to God's word is as great as it was then. He effectively asks them if they have learned the needed lessons from the exilic experience.

<span id="page-681-12"></span><span id="page-681-2"></span>7:8–10 God summarizes the heart of the message of the "former prophets" (cf. 1:4) and states that he values justice more than religious rituals like fasting (e.g., 1 Sam. 15:22–23; Amos 5:21–27; Mic. 6:7–8). There are many parallels in these verses to Jeremiah's temple sermon (in Jeremiah 7), where Jeremiah repudiates the idea that temple service provides impunity from the consequences of unethical behavior.

<span id="page-681-15"></span><span id="page-681-13"></span><span id="page-681-8"></span><span id="page-681-1"></span><span id="page-681-0"></span>"Render true judgments" (Zech. 7:9) is broader than simply ruling faithfully in legal cases, though it certainly includes this (cf. 8:16–17). This phrase can also be translated "judge true justice," which is first and foremost found in God and the rightness of his ways (Deut. 32:4; Ps. 89:14). "Justice" is often paired with "righteousness," and together they constitute an ethical ideal for God's people described also as keeping "the way of the Lord" (e.g., Gen. 18:19). Justice also represents right relationships as enshrined in the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai, encompassing "kindness and mercy" (Zech. 7:9; cf. Jer. 9:24; Hos. 2:19; 12:6). Justice also means not oppressing the weak and vulnerable—"the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor" (Zech. 7:10; cf. Isa. 1:17; Jer. 7:6). Furthermore, justice is not merely external acts but extends to thoughts and motivations: "Let none of you devise evil against another in your heart" (Zech. 7:10), where the "heart" is the seat of the will in Hebrew thought. God's people are to judge or determine what is right and true in all their relationships—and then do it!

<span id="page-681-14"></span><span id="page-681-7"></span><span id="page-681-4"></span>7:11–12 The ancestors' refusal to obey God's words is stated in four ways: (1) "they refused to pay attention" (cf. Jer. 7:24; Zech. 1:4); (2) they "turned a stubborn shoulder," using the image of an animal that refuses the yoke (e.g., Ex. 32:9; Jer. 7:24); (3) they "stopped their ears that they might not hear," indicating a willful refusal (cf. Isa. 6:10; Zech. 1:4); and (4) "they made their hearts diamond-hard" (Zech. 7:12; cf. Jer. 6:28; 17:1; Ezek. 3:7–9; 11:19).

<span id="page-681-16"></span><span id="page-681-10"></span><span id="page-681-9"></span><span id="page-681-6"></span><span id="page-681-5"></span>God's words to the community came by the law and the prophets (cf. Mal. 4:4–6). Zechariah 7:12 also clearly links the words of the prophets with the agency of God's Spirit (cf. 4:6; Ezek. 11:5; Mic. 3:8). Their fathers' rejection of God's word led to their rightly experiencing his "great anger" (Zech. 7:12). The exile as God's anger at those who continued to refuse him reiterates the introduction of the book (cf. 1:2). The consequences of this anger are elaborated in 7:13–14.

<span id="page-682-3"></span>7:13 Because the people refused to listen to God and continued in their unjust ways, God shut his ears to their prayers. The implication is that they asked God for things only when it suited them—they treated him as their servant, further insulting him.

<span id="page-682-4"></span>7:14 The result was that God "scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations." The verb "scatter" conveys the idea of being blown by the wind of a storm. Although a different verb is used here, this echoes the covenant curse of "scattering" (Lev. 26:31–33; Deut. 28:64). It refers to exile and dispersion among the nations—those whom "they had not known."

<span id="page-682-2"></span><span id="page-682-0"></span>The prosperous situation referred to in verse 7 is undone: "the land they left was desolate, . . . the pleasant land was made desolate." That "no one went to and fro" suggests a lack of security, travel, and trade. While it was God who scattered the people in judgment, the people bore responsibility through their refusal to listen to God's word. God is sovereign in judgment, and the people bear responsibility for their sin.

### *Response*

With the near completion of the temple, a delegation comes to Jerusalem from Bethel to ask if fasting is still appropriate, since fasting was instituted in response to the destruction of the temple some seventy years earlier. Zechariah uses the occasion to challenge the delegation (and readers and hearers of his book) concerning their motives and their obedience to the word of God. The (negative) example of the fathers is used to warn of the danger of religious hypocrisy and refusal to listen to the prophets—the fathers suffered the consequences of God's wrath in the judgment of exile.

<span id="page-682-7"></span><span id="page-682-1"></span>Zechariah's key point is that repentance to God and humble obedience to his word is more important than rituals such as fasting. This theme is found elsewhere in the OT (e.g., 1 Sam. 15:22; Ps. 51:16–17). Likewise, Jesus teaches his followers that repentance and humility before God is more important than fasting (e.g., Luke 18:9–14). In several instances, Jesus indicts religious leaders who were very public in their observance of religious rituals but failed in the weightier matters of the law, such as justice, mercy, faith, and the love of God (e.g., Matt. 23:23; Luke 11:32; John 7:24). Zechariah's concern for care of the poor and love of the disadvantaged is an emphasis found across the Bible (e.g., Matt. 9:13; 1 Cor. 11:17–34; Gal. 6:10; 1 Tim. 5:8–16; 1 John 3:17).

<span id="page-682-9"></span><span id="page-682-8"></span><span id="page-682-6"></span><span id="page-682-5"></span>A real danger for modern Christians rightly concerned about injustices in many parts of the world is to call for social justice elsewhere while ignoring injustice before our very eyes—in our homes, churches, businesses, and Christian institutions. When justice and righteousness is not served in our own spheres of influence, any concern expressed for justice elsewhere rings hollow and is hypocritical. Christians must also recognize that the call for justice must first be grounded in the gospel of grace and must flow out of a relationship with God, or else we run the danger of sounding sim<span id="page-683-1"></span>ply like angry legalists. To expect people to love others genuinely (with no thought of personal gain) without being in relationship with Jesus Christ is like expecting fruit to grow apart from a tree (to use a biblical metaphor). For Zechariah and the rest of the Bible, right relationships with others (particularly seen in apt treatment of the weak and vulnerable) are evidence of a right relationship with God: "Whoever loves has been born of God and knows God" (1 John 4:7).

## <span id="page-683-0"></span>ZECHARIAH 8:1–23

8 And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying, **<sup>2</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath. **3**Thus says the Lord: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, the holy mountain. **<sup>4</sup>**Thus says the Lord of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age. **5**And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. **6**Thus says the Lord of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the Lord of hosts? **7**Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country, **<sup>8</sup>** and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness."

**<sup>9</sup>**Thus says the Lord of hosts: "Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. **10**For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor. **11**But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the Lord of hosts. **12**For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. **13**And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong."

**<sup>14</sup>**For thus says the Lord of hosts: "As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the Lord of hosts, **<sup>15</sup>** so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not. **16**These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace; **17**do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the Lord."

**<sup>18</sup>**And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, **<sup>19</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.

**<sup>20</sup>** "Thus says the Lord of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities. **21**The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, 'Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord and to seek the Lord of hosts; I myself am going.' **22**Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the Lord. **23**Thus says the Lord of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, 'Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.' "

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-684-4"></span><span id="page-684-1"></span><span id="page-684-0"></span>Chapters 7–8 form a unit that begins with a question from a delegation from Bethel to Jerusalem and ends with its answer (cf. Section Overview of 7:1–14). The question gives Zechariah opportunity to restate pertinent covenant requirements to the people and reaffirm the hope for God's coming kingdom. Whereas chapter 7 focused on the failure of earlier generations, chapter 8 has a more positive tone, calling for obedience in view of future salvation and blessing; the city of Jerusalem will be filled (vv. 1–8), and the land will be fruitful (vv. 9–13). The future blessing of the nations at the end of chapter 8 functions to introduce chapters 9–14, which explore the process by which the nations will ultimately recognize the Lord in Jerusalem (a theme of ch. 14).

<span id="page-684-12"></span><span id="page-684-9"></span><span id="page-684-8"></span>Chapter 8 contains ten promises of blessing, each beginning with "Thus says the Lord (of hosts)" (vv. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 19, 20, 23). Two broader sections are each introduced by the phrase, "And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me" (vv. 1–17; 18–23).

<span id="page-684-7"></span>At the heart of this section is God's desire for a restored relationship with his people. Through renewed covenant faithfulness, God's people will experience his blessing and reflect his character to the world so that the nations will be drawn to seek the Lord.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-684-5"></span><span id="page-684-3"></span><span id="page-684-2"></span>8:1 In response to the question of the delegation from Bethel (7:1–3), God's word for Zechariah to the community continues (cf. 7:1, 4, 8; 8:18). The description <span id="page-685-5"></span>"Lord of hosts" occurs eighteen times in chapter 8 (cf. comment on 1:2–6a). This introduction to Zechariah's oracles indicates that they come with all the authority of God and underscores why readers and hearers should pay attention to what he says.

<span id="page-685-10"></span><span id="page-685-6"></span>8:2–3 God's jealousy for Zion was a theme of 1:14 (cf. comment there). "Jealousy" refers to God's willingness to defend what rightly belongs to him by judging "with great wrath" both those who oppose his people and those of his people who refuse him.

<span id="page-685-11"></span><span id="page-685-8"></span><span id="page-685-7"></span><span id="page-685-3"></span>God's jealousy is the grounds for his turning to his people (8:3). God's statement "I have returned" can also be translated "I have turned" (cf. 1:16; 2:10). As in 1:16, God has turned to his people with mercy (seen in the many who have returned from exile to rebuild Jerusalem). Yet the hope found in places like Ezekiel 43:4 for God's return to "dwell in the midst of Jerusalem," with his glory returning to the temple, still lies in the future, after the temple's completion (cf. Zech. 2:10–11; Mal. 3:1). When the Lord's glory returns to the city, Jerusalem "shall be called the faithful city," with its inhabitants reflecting God's character as reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. There is possibly an echo here of the transformation of Jerusalem in Isaiah (e.g., Isa. 1:21–2:5).

<span id="page-685-18"></span><span id="page-685-4"></span><span id="page-685-1"></span><span id="page-685-0"></span>The "mountain" is a reference to Mount Zion, the temple site in Jerusalem (cf. Hag. 1:8). It will be "the holy mountain" because God will dwell upon it (cf. Jer. 31:23; Ezek. 20:40). This holiness is later said to expand throughout Jerusalem and Judah from the temple (Zech. 14:20–21).

<span id="page-685-17"></span><span id="page-685-14"></span><span id="page-685-13"></span><span id="page-685-12"></span>8:4–5 These verses picture and promise the future prosperity of Jerusalem. The elderly and children were the first to perish when cities were besieged, and were forced to work in times of hardship. In contrast, here the elderly are "of great age" and have time to "sit in the streets of Jerusalem" (v. 4), and "boys and girls" are "playing in its streets" (v. 5). These streets are not transport routes (posing danger) but open places between houses (an alternative translation is "squares"). The picture is a contrast with Lamentations, where in the immediate aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem and exile the "streets" are associated with death (e.g., Lam. 2:11–12). Now God promises to fill them with life.

<span id="page-685-15"></span><span id="page-685-2"></span>8:6 The word translated "marvelous" can carry the idea of "improbable," "incredible," "wonderful," or "miraculous." The future prosperity promised to Jerusalem in verses 4–5 may seem too good to be true ("incredible") to the "remnant of this people" (those who had survived and returned from exile), but not to God, presumably because of his infinite power to save (cf. 4:10).

<span id="page-685-16"></span><span id="page-685-9"></span>8:7–8 God will bring his people back from the lands to which they were scattered in exile. The phrase "from the east country and from the west country" can be translated more poetically (and closer to the Hebrew), "from the land where the sun rises to where it sets," denoting all the lands to which the people had been exiled. Presumably they are saved from the coming judgment of God on the <span id="page-686-16"></span><span id="page-686-12"></span>nations (cf. 1:21; 6:7–8). God "will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem" (8:8; cf. 2:6; 7:14). Normally it is the Lord who is said to "dwell in the midst of Jerusalem," but here the phrase expresses what God will do for his people to restore relationship with them. The expression "They shall be my people, and I will be their God" is classic covenant terminology expressing the close fellowship between God and his people (cf. 13:9; Ex. 6:7; Lev. 26:12). This language is also associated with the promised new covenant (e.g., Jer. 24:7; 31:33; Ezek. 11:20). The salvation and restoration of Jerusalem are expressions of God's faithfulness (keeping his word) and his righteousness (doing what is right).

<span id="page-686-17"></span><span id="page-686-15"></span><span id="page-686-7"></span><span id="page-686-6"></span><span id="page-686-5"></span><span id="page-686-2"></span><span id="page-686-1"></span><span id="page-686-0"></span>8:9 "Let your hands be strong" is a call for courage (cf. 8:13; Judg. 7:11; 2 Sam. 2:7; Ezek. 22:14) so that they can finish building the temple (cf. also Hag. 2:4–5). It is directed toward those "who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets," including Zechariah and his contemporary, Haggai (cf. Zech. 7:3). This seems at first to be a discrepancy, for these prophets are said to be "present on the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid," while in Ezra 3:8–13 the foundation of the temple was laid twenty years before Haggai and Zechariah began their prophetic ministries (cf. Hag. 1:1; Zech. 1:1). The best solution is to see Zechariah as referring not to the laying of the foundation of the temple twenty years earlier by Zerubbabel under the patronage of Sheshbazzar (cf. 4:9), but to the foundation-laying ceremony on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius (cf. Hag. 2:18). This marked the resumption of the work in response to the preaching of these prophets (cf. Ezra 4:24–5:2). The people Zechariah addresses were present at this occasion.

<span id="page-686-18"></span><span id="page-686-14"></span><span id="page-686-11"></span><span id="page-686-9"></span><span id="page-686-4"></span><span id="page-686-3"></span>8:10–11 These verses contain several echoes of the book of Haggai and speak of difficult times as the people suffer the curses of the covenant for disobedience. "Before those days" (cf. Hag. 2:15) refers to the period before the preaching of the prophets. At that time there was "no wage for man or any wage for beast" (Zech. 8:10; cf. Hag. 1:11)—those who worked went unpaid. "Neither was there any safety from the foe" (Zech. 8:10; cf. Ezra 4:1–5), indicating a threat for those who traveled outside Jerusalem ("for him who went out or came in"). There was also conflict within the community, with "every man against his neighbor" (Zech. 8:10). While hypothetical, this conflict could have concerned land titles between those who were exiled and those who had stayed.

<span id="page-686-19"></span><span id="page-686-13"></span>In verse 11, God again promises a great reversal of the adverse situation of the "former days" (described in v. 10) for the "remnant of this people" (cf. v. 6; Hag. 1:12, 14; 2:2). The curse of his judgment will be removed.

<span id="page-686-20"></span><span id="page-686-10"></span><span id="page-686-8"></span>8:12–13 When God turns to his people in mercy, covenant curses will be replaced with covenant blessings (cf. Hag. 1:10). "Peace" (Hb. *shalom*) is promised with an agricultural metaphor ("a sowing of peace"). This is apt, as many of the covenant blessings refer to abundant agricultural produce. "Peace" is more than the absence of warfare; it is the full experience of God's salvation and blessing (cf. <span id="page-687-13"></span><span id="page-687-11"></span><span id="page-687-8"></span><span id="page-687-2"></span>Zech. 6:13; 8:16, 19; 9:10). Three images develop this: (1) "the vine shall give its fruit" (cf. 3:10)—it took four to five years from planting for a vine to produce a usable crop, and warfare often destroyed vineyards (e.g., Jer. 12:10); (2) "the ground shall give its produce" (cf. Deut. 28:4, 11–12); and (3) "the heavens shall give their dew"—dew formed at night and provided water for plant life to flourish. These are all signs of God's favor and come by his hand: "I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things"—the word "possess" can also be translated "inherit" (cf. Isa. 57:13; Ezek. 47:14).

<span id="page-687-20"></span><span id="page-687-7"></span><span id="page-687-0"></span>In the exile, God's people were under his curse, which was acknowledged "among the nations" (Zech. 8:13). Again God promises to save his people, that they "shall be a blessing" to the nations, echoing the promise to Abraham (Gen. 12:3). Reference to the "house of Judah and the house of Israel" shows a concern for the restoration and reunification of the nation, a theme seen also in Zechariah 9:1, 10, 13; 10:6.

<span id="page-687-27"></span>"Let your hands be strong" (cf. comment on 8:9) is a challenge to trust God's promises and complete the work on the temple.

<span id="page-687-21"></span><span id="page-687-19"></span><span id="page-687-18"></span><span id="page-687-10"></span><span id="page-687-9"></span>8:14–15 "For" introduces a summary of verses 1–13. In the past God was angry with their forefathers and brought the "disaster" of the destruction of Jerusalem and exile on them as punishment for their sin (v. 14; cf. 1:2, 6, 12, 15). God "did not relent"; he "showed no pity" (NIV) because they did not repent (cf. 7:11–14). The appointed seventy years ran their course (cf. 1:12). But now Jerusalem and Judah will experience the "good" things of God (8:15; cf. 1:17; Josh. 24:20; Ezek. 36:11), spilling out to the nations (Zech. 8:20–23). Because of God's promise to save and bless his people, they should not fear (v. 15) but obey (vv. 16–19).

<span id="page-687-26"></span><span id="page-687-23"></span><span id="page-687-22"></span><span id="page-687-17"></span><span id="page-687-3"></span>8:16–17 The words of the earlier prophets continue to apply (cf. 7:9–10). Zechariah provides four injunctions; the commands "Speak the truth" and "Do not devise evil in your hearts" call for honesty and integrity in personal relationships, while "Render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace" and "Love no false oath" call for right administration of justice in the community. The "gates" were where the city elders met to hear disputes and render judgments (e.g., Deut. 21:19; 25:7; Ruth 4:1, 11; Amos 5:15). The two negative commands in Zechariah 8:17 involve things God hates (cf. 5:3–4, 8). While God wants the temple to be rebuilt, this is not an end in itself. The ethical transformation of his people is critical.

<span id="page-687-25"></span><span id="page-687-24"></span><span id="page-687-14"></span><span id="page-687-12"></span><span id="page-687-1"></span>8:18–19 The longer prophetic messenger formula in verse 18 marks the final section in the wider unit of chapters 7–8 (cf. 7:1, 4, 8; 8:1). This section returns to the original question of the delegation from Bethel concerning fasting (7:2–3).

<span id="page-687-16"></span><span id="page-687-15"></span><span id="page-687-6"></span><span id="page-687-5"></span><span id="page-687-4"></span>In addition to the fasts mentioned earlier (cf. comments on 7:3; 7:4–5), God mentions two additional fasts not referred to elsewhere in the OT. The fast of the "fourth month" is thought to commemorate the Babylonian army's breaching the walls of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:2–4). The fast of the "tenth" month recalls the beginning of the siege against Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:1). These will all become "seasons of joy and gladness" (cf. Isa. 35:10; 51:3, 11; Jer. 31:13; 33:10–11) and <span id="page-688-6"></span>"cheerful feasts" (cf. Zech. 14:18; Isa. 33:20). Solemn fasts will be replaced by joyous feasts—celebration will replace lamentation.

<span id="page-688-14"></span><span id="page-688-12"></span>The injunction to "love truth and peace" summarizes God's concern for the social dimensions of life found throughout chapters 7–8 (cf. Zech. 7:9; 8:3, 8, 10, 12, 16) and is the opposite of that which God hates in 8:17. Hence, God's turning to Jerusalem with mercy (vv. 3, 15) involves more than turning fasting into feasting; it calls for radical ethical transformation.

<span id="page-688-18"></span><span id="page-688-17"></span><span id="page-688-15"></span><span id="page-688-11"></span><span id="page-688-10"></span>8:20–21 At the beginning of chapter 7, a delegation came from Bethel to Jerusalem to "entreat the favor of the Lord" (v. 2). This journey is now a pattern for the "inhabitants of many cities" in the future (8:20), probably a reference in the first instance to cities, like Bethel, that surrounded Jerusalem (cf. 7:7). It seems they will be caught up in the excitement of what God is doing in Jerusalem and will tell others (8:21; cf. Isa. 2:2).

<span id="page-688-19"></span><span id="page-688-7"></span><span id="page-688-3"></span>8:22 This desire to pilgrimage to Jerusalem spreads beyond Judah to "many peoples and strong nations," a reference to those from foreign nations (cf. v. 23). The powerful will recognize true power and will come to Jerusalem to "seek the Lord of hosts . . . and to entreat" his favor, seeking his mercy and salvation (cf. 2:11). The theme of the pilgrimage of nations to Jerusalem is found in earlier prophets, especially Isaiah (cf. Isa. 2:2–4; 42:1–7; 49:22–23; 60:14; 66:18–24), and is an outworking of God's promise to Abraham to bless "all the families of the earth" (Gen. 12:3; 17:4–7).

<span id="page-688-22"></span><span id="page-688-20"></span><span id="page-688-16"></span><span id="page-688-13"></span><span id="page-688-8"></span><span id="page-688-4"></span><span id="page-688-1"></span><span id="page-688-0"></span>8:23 The phrase "in those days" points to a future day of salvation (cf. 2:11; 3:10), in contrast with "these days" of 8:9 and 8:15. The ratio of ten to one speaks of a great multitude "from the nations of every tongue" (cf. Rev. 7:9). At Babel, humanity united together in opposition to God. In judgment, God confused their language and scattered them (Gen. 11:7–8). This verse envisages the reversal of Babel, as all languages and nations seek God on his terms and join together in the "cheerful feasts" (Zech. 8:19) in Jerusalem. The custom of taking "hold of the robe of a Jew" lays claim to a desired relationship or outcome (cf. Ruth 3:9; 1 Sam. 15:27). A "Jew" refers to a "Judahite," one from the tribe of Judah. Chapters 9–14 of Zechariah continue to show the crucial importance of the tribe of Judah in God's salvation plan, particularly as the tribe of the house of David and the future Davidic king ("Judah" is mentioned fourteen times in these chapters).

<span id="page-688-21"></span><span id="page-688-5"></span><span id="page-688-2"></span>The nations desire to go to Jerusalem because they have heard that "God is with you" (cf. "Immanuel" in Isa. 7:14; 8:10). This idea summarizes Zechariah's hope for God to return to dwell among his people. With God's return, the nations will turn from enemies to friends.

## *Response*

<span id="page-688-9"></span>In response to a question about the need to continue to fast in view of the temple's near completion (7:1–3), Zechariah calls the people to renewed covenant obedience. <span id="page-689-6"></span><span id="page-689-3"></span>In chapter 8, the call is issued in view of God's future salvation and blessing (vv. 1– 19) and the responsibility and privilege Judah and Israel share in God's purposes for the salvation of the nations (vv. 20–23). Israel is to reflect the character of God in their lives together, with a view to the salvation of the nations. The character of God is known from the requirements of the Torah and the words of the earlier prophets. Many of the oracles in this chapter reflect themes of chapters 1–7.

<span id="page-689-1"></span>The call to covenant obedience is a response to God's turning to his people in mercy and grace now that Jeremiah's seventy years of judgment are near completion. It is important to note the sequence here. Obedience to the law is not the people's initiative to win God's blessing as a reward for their devotion. Rather, God offers his blessing to those who respond obediently to his covenant mercy—his blessing issues from his grace. Yet obedience is required to experience fully the blessings of the covenant.29 In other words, the concern with ethics (community living in obedience to Torah) and worship (the temple service) is to be an outworking of restored relationship between God and his people as they reflect his character to the world.

<span id="page-689-7"></span><span id="page-689-0"></span>Historically, this obedience proved too difficult for the nation of Israel. But where Israel failed, God succeeded through the faithful obedience of his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:19). As Israel's representative, his obedience unto death won the full blessings of the covenant—not only for Israel but also for the nations (in line with the promises to Abraham, e.g., Gen. 12:3; 17:4–7). Jesus also fulfills and expands all that the city of Jerusalem represents: the presence and rule of God (Gal. 4:25–26; Heb. 13:14). While all this may have seemed too good to be true for the remnant (Zech. 8:5), God achieved it through his sovereign power in his Son.

<span id="page-689-13"></span><span id="page-689-12"></span><span id="page-689-10"></span><span id="page-689-9"></span><span id="page-689-8"></span><span id="page-689-5"></span><span id="page-689-4"></span><span id="page-689-2"></span>Christians now have every spiritual blessing in Christ (Eph. 1:3) and are called to new covenant obedience in view of God's grace in saving us in Christ Jesus (Eph. 2:8–10). Furthermore, like Zechariah 8, with its focus on future blessing, Christians are to live in view of the future consummation of all things (Eph. 1:3– 12). New covenant obedience also involves reflecting God's character to the world, "to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness" (Eph. 4:24); to "be imitators of God, as beloved children" (Eph. 5:1). For a representative survey of what this looks like under the new covenant, read Ephesians 4:17–5:20, noting Paul's similarity in many ways to the old covenant (e.g., cf. Zech. 8:16 with Eph. 4:25, and Zech. 8:17 with Eph. 5:2). Yet a marked difference to Zechariah's day is that Christians now have God's resurrection power at work within them (Eph. 1:19–20).

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-691-2"></span>Zechariah 9–14 consists of two prophetic oracles dramatically portraying God's return to his people in Jerusalem. His return is depicted with many expressions and images drawn from Israel's prior history. The first prophetic oracle, in chapters 9–11, presents God's subduing enemy nations and their kings (9:1–11:3) and explains how the nation wound up in the situation they were in (11:4–17).

<span id="page-691-5"></span><span id="page-691-4"></span><span id="page-691-3"></span><span id="page-691-1"></span><span id="page-691-0"></span>The broad outline for the Lord's return is given in chapter 9, where God's coming will reclaim the land (vv. 1–8), through his king (vv. 9–10), for his people (vv. 11–17). There are at least three theories for the particular cities mentioned in verses 1–8. First, some argue they correlate to a military campaign, such as that of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC, but the details do not match exactly. However, the broad movement from north to south does mirror his and earlier campaigns. A second view understands the cities to designate the ideal land of Israel. There is evidence that King David incorporated many of these cities into his empire, and that some paid him tribute. Furthermore, while these cities existed during Zechariah's time, they did not particularly threaten Judah. In referring to them, it seems Zechariah is drawing on Israel's past history to portray the future

<span id="page-692-3"></span>reclamation of the Israelite kingdom. A third view notes that earlier prophets prophesied the downfall of many of these cities before Israel's restoration would take place (e.g., Jeremiah 25; Ezekiel 26–28; Amos 1). On this view, Zechariah is simply restating earlier prophecies awaiting fulfillment. It is possible that elements of all three views may be part of the rationale for mentioning these particular cities.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-692-4"></span>9:1 "The oracle of the word of the Lord" can also be translated "An oracle. The word of the Lord." In that case, "an oracle" would serve as a heading to remind the reader and hearer that what follows is God's word.30 As a description, it indicates a prophecy renewing earlier prophecy, claiming it is still in effect and awaits fulfillment.31

<span id="page-692-6"></span><span id="page-692-5"></span>"The word of the Lord is against" may indicate that the prophecies of the earlier prophets against the cities and regions mentioned in verses 1–7 still stand. However, the "land of Hadrach" is not otherwise mentioned in the OT. It is probably land of the city of Hatarikka, known from Assyrian sources, where it is mentioned along with "Hamath" (cf. v. 2). This would locate it on the border of Damascus, the capital of Syria (Aram), to the north of Israel. Earlier prophecies against Damascus include Isaiah 17:1–9; Jeremiah 49:23–27; and Amos 1:3–5. Historically, King David subdued Damascus, which paid him tribute. He also set up garrisons in Damascus and established it as an administrative center for several northern districts (2 Sam. 8:6–8).

<span id="page-692-2"></span><span id="page-692-1"></span><span id="page-692-0"></span>The phrase "For the Lord has an eye on mankind and on all the tribes of Israel" is difficult to translate on account of the poetic nature of the Hebrew. An alternative translation is, "For to the Lord belongs the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel." In that case it would seem to echo Isaiah 17:7 (also a prophecy against Damascus), which says, "In that day man will look to his Maker, and his eyes will look on the Holy One of Israel." In the context of Isaiah, "man" refers to the people of the nations who will turn from their idols and acknowledge the Lord as their cities come under his judgment. This fits the context of Zechariah well, where the judgment of the nations results in their turning their eyes to Israel's God, along with "all the tribes of Israel." Referring to Israel in this way seems to envision a reunification of the tribes as in the time of David and Solomon (cf. 9:10–13; 10:6).

<span id="page-692-7"></span><sup>30</sup> The Hebrew of "oracle" is *massa'* and also appears in 12:1 (translated "burden") and Malachi 1:1 (translated "oracle").

<sup>31</sup> See further M. J. Boda, "Freeing the Burden of Prophecy: *Massa* and the Legitimacy of Prophecy in Zech 9–14," *Bib* 87 (2006): 338–357.

<span id="page-693-16"></span><span id="page-693-6"></span>9:2–4 "Hamath" is either a city or a district located between Hadrach and Damascus. It was hostile to Israel until David subdued it (2 Sam. 8:9–10); Solomon later controlled it (2 Chron. 8:4).

<span id="page-693-11"></span><span id="page-693-8"></span>Moving westward to the coast, "Tyre and Sidon" were trade ports of great wealth and security. The description of them as "wise" refers to their skill or shrewdness, probably in trade, rather than to fear of the Lord (cf. Ezek. 28:3–5). Tyre's "rampart" refers to a breakwater built as fortification against invasion. Tyre's wealth is captured in the description "heaped up silver like dust, and fine gold like the mud of the streets." While Tyre and Sidon were never incorporated into Israel, the king of Tyre helped build palaces for David and Solomon (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Kings 9:11). In Ezekiel's vision of the idealized land, Tyre falls into Manasseh's territory and Sidon into Naphtali's (Ezek. 48:3–4).

<span id="page-693-14"></span><span id="page-693-12"></span><span id="page-693-10"></span><span id="page-693-9"></span><span id="page-693-7"></span><span id="page-693-4"></span>There are also several earlier prophetic oracles against these cities (Isaiah 23; Jer. 25:22; Ezekiel 26–28; Joel 3:4–8). Zechariah reaffirms that God will judge these cities in the northern regions (9:4; cf. 6:1–8). The word "power" (9:4) can also be translated as "army," perhaps alluding to the striking down of Pharaoh's army in the exodus (Ex. 14:28; 15:21). Destruction by fire was also common in divine warfare (cf. Amos 1:9–10).

<span id="page-693-18"></span><span id="page-693-17"></span><span id="page-693-13"></span><span id="page-693-5"></span><span id="page-693-2"></span><span id="page-693-1"></span>9:5–7 Moving south, God mentions four of the five cities associated with the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, Ashdod).32 These cities defined part of the borders of the territory of Judah (Josh. 15:11, 45–46), but Israel did not subdue them until David's time (2 Sam. 5:17–25; 21:15–22). Jeremiah 47:4 shows that Tyre and Sidon supported the Philistines, hence the judgment of Tyre causes these cities great fear and anguish (Zech. 9:5). God's judgment will fall on these cities, too, with Gaza's king perishing and Ashkelon losing its inhabitants. The "mixed people" (v. 6) seems to refer to people born from parents of different nations—a people who has lost any distinct national identity. God will "cut off the pride of Philistia" (v. 6), a summary of his judgment on these cities' being self-reliant ("pride") and opposed to God.

<span id="page-693-19"></span><span id="page-693-0"></span>Yet judgment is not the final word. God will also remove what is unclean: ". . . its blood from its mouth and its abominations from between its teeth." These images presumably refer to the Philistine practices of eating meat with its lifeblood still in it and eating food associated with idolatry. These are elsewhere forbidden both directly and indirectly by God (e.g., Gen. 9:4; Lev. 17:10–14; Deut. 12:23, 31). God will incorporate "a remnant" of the Philistines (Zech. 9:7) into his people, as he did with the Jebusites, inhabitants of Jerusalem before David captured it. Rather than being destroyed, the Jebusites were absorbed into Judah (2 Sam. 5:6–9; 24:18–24). Zechariah envisages God judging and saving the nations (cf. Zech. 8:22–23).

<span id="page-693-20"></span><span id="page-693-15"></span><span id="page-693-3"></span>9:8 After judging the nations on the borders of the land, God will return to "encamp" at his "house" (or "temple") and protect his people from invaders and

<sup>32</sup> The fifth city of the Philistine pentapolis was Gath. These cities posed their greatest threat to Israel in the twelfth and eleventh centuries.

<span id="page-694-15"></span>oppressors (cf. 7:14). This also brings King David to mind, as it was only in his time that God "camped" in the tabernacle tent in Jerusalem. "Now I see with my own eyes" could simply mean God is watching over his people, or that he sees the plight of his people and is about to act in their favor (as in Ex. 2:25). Reference to "eyes" also links back to the "eye" in verse 1.

<span id="page-694-18"></span><span id="page-694-17"></span><span id="page-694-12"></span><span id="page-694-10"></span><span id="page-694-9"></span><span id="page-694-8"></span><span id="page-694-7"></span><span id="page-694-5"></span><span id="page-694-2"></span><span id="page-694-1"></span>9:9–10 With the return of the Lord to Jerusalem, the inhabitants of Jerusalem are exhorted to "rejoice greatly" and "shout aloud" to welcome their king (cf. 2:10; Zeph. 3:14). The expressions "daughter of Zion" and "daughter of Jerusalem" refer poetically to the inhabitants of Jerusalem (cf. comment on Zech. 2:7). The expression "your king" suggests it is the Davidic king, expected by earlier prophets, who will come (cf. 3:8; 6:12). Unlike many previous kings, this king will be "righteous" (cf. Jer. 23:5). Second, this king is said to have "salvation." The Hebrew can also be translated with the sense that the king has been "saved" (cf. Deut. 33:29; Ps. 33:16–17). In this case, the future king has been saved by God in the context of God's defeat of the nations (Zech. 9:1–8) and he now comes to the royal city of Jerusalem. Third, the king is "humble" (alternatively, the Hebrew can be translated "afflicted"; cf. Isa. 53:4, 7, where Isaiah's suffering servant is "afflicted" not for his own sins, like David, but for the sins of others). The background to Zechariah's picture seems to be the suffering David of 2 Samuel and the Psalms, along with the suffering servant of Isaiah. These have been woven together in Zechariah's portrait of the future king here and throughout chapters 9–14.33 This explains the fourth description of the king as "mounted on a donkey." During David's exile from Jerusalem, when he was nearly defeated by his enemies, he rode a donkey (cf. 2 Sam. 16:2).34 God saved David in battle and delivered him back to Jerusalem as king. In combining these images, Zechariah speaks of the future righteous Davidic king of prophetic expectation who, having been saved by God from the affliction of exile, will return to Jerusalem on a donkey and will "speak peace to the nations" (Zech. 9:10; cf. the "peace" of 6:13). The forgiveness of sin associated with Isaiah's servant is the focus of the king's work in Zechariah 12:10–13:1 (cf. 3:9).

<span id="page-694-19"></span><span id="page-694-16"></span><span id="page-694-14"></span><span id="page-694-13"></span><span id="page-694-6"></span><span id="page-694-4"></span><span id="page-694-3"></span>The "chariot" and "war horse" were key weapons of warfare for Israel and Judah in the ninth and eighth centuries. God says he will "cut off" or destroy these weapons, along with the "battle bow" (cf. Isa. 2:4). Mentioning Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) and Jerusalem (cf. Zech. 9:13) hints at a reunified kingdom, as under David (cf. 2 Sam. 2:10–11; 5:1–5). The coming king "shall speak peace to the nations"—not just the absence of war, but the peace of salvation (pictured in Zech. 9:16–17). The king's rule will extend "from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth" (v. 10), an expression capturing his universal reign over all nations (cf. Gen. 49:10–11; Ps. 72:8).

<span id="page-694-20"></span><span id="page-694-11"></span><span id="page-694-0"></span><sup>33</sup> See further M. R. Stead, "Suffering Servant, Suffering David, and Stricken Shepherd," in M. R. Stead, ed., *Christ Died for Our Sins: Essays on the Atonement* (Canberra: Barton, 2013), 62–83.

<sup>34</sup> The expression "on a colt, the foal of a donkey" can also be translated "on a donkey, namely a purebred jackass," where a "jackass" is a male donkey. See further K. C. Way, *Donkeys in the Biblical World: Ceremony and Symbol* (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2011), 163.

<span id="page-695-21"></span><span id="page-695-19"></span><span id="page-695-5"></span>9:11–12 The Lord continues to address his people ("you" refers to "daughter of Zion" and "daughter of Jerusalem" in v. 9), outlining further elements of his salvation. These will come on account of the "blood of my covenant with you." The covenant with Israel at Sinai was ratified with blood, indicating God's commitment to his people (cf. Ex. 24:8). This covenant commitment means the "prisoners" will be set "free from the waterless pit," like Joseph (Gen. 37:24) and Jeremiah (Jer. 38:6). This image may refer specifically to those still living in foreign lands, or it may be a more general reference to the end of exile. To "set your prisoners free" also echoes the exodus (Ex. 5:1)—the end of exile is a new exodus.

Zech. 2:7). They are "prisoners *of hope*" because of the promises of restoration after exile built into the national covenant (cf. Deut. 30:1–6). There is wordplay in the Hebrew: when the people "return" (*shub*), God "will restore" (*'ashib*) "double" (as in Zech. 1:3—"Return to me . . . and I will return to you."). The double restoration echoes Isaiah 61:1–7 (cf. Isa. 40:2), where prisoners are set free and given a double portion in the land. Also behind this idea may be the double restoration after "exile" in the cases of Joseph (Gen. 48:22) and Job (Job 42:10).

<span id="page-695-22"></span><span id="page-695-20"></span><span id="page-695-10"></span><span id="page-695-1"></span>9:13 The means to the "peace" in verse 10 is God's using his people as weapons to overthrow opposition. God will use Judah as his "bow" and Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) as his "arrow"; at the end of the verse they are likened to a "warrior's sword." Reference to Judah and Ephraim points to a reunited kingdom of Israel (cf. v. 1; 10:6–7).

<span id="page-695-16"></span><span id="page-695-15"></span>While some take the reference to "Greece" to indicate that chapters 9–14 come from a much later time, this is unnecessary. At the beginning of the fifth century BC, the Greeks had proved to be quite troublesome to the Persians. To assert God's defeat of the Greeks is a bold claim of his power. In addition, the Philistines had sold the people of Jerusalem and Judah to the Greeks (cf. Joel 3:4–6), and this prophecy envisages their being freed and returned.

<span id="page-695-23"></span><span id="page-695-14"></span><span id="page-695-11"></span><span id="page-695-3"></span>9:14–15 Like God's salvation in the exodus (Ex. 15:1–21), the Lord will appear as a warrior to save his people. He will come as an army on the "march," shooting "his arrow" and sounding "the trumpet" as part of the battle (Zech. 9:14; cf. 6:1–8; 9:1–8). The "whirlwinds of the south" may also echo exodus themes, along with the "lightning" and "trumpet," associated with God's appearance at Sinai (Ex. 19:16).

<span id="page-695-18"></span><span id="page-695-17"></span><span id="page-695-9"></span><span id="page-695-7"></span><span id="page-695-6"></span><span id="page-695-4"></span>In the battle, the Lord will "protect," or shield, his people, who "shall devour, and tread down the sling stones" (Zech. 9:15). This is a poetic way of picturing the enemies of God's people being obliterated in battle. The sound of the battle will be like the "roar" of those "drunk with wine," and the sight of it like blood at a sacrifice: "full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar" (cf. Ex. 29:13; Lev. 4:7, 17, 25). Just as the foreign nations consumed blood as part of their idolatrous worship (Zech. 9:7), so their blood will be consumed by the Israelites (metaphorically speaking) in battle. Other prophets also compare God's victory over his enemies to a sacrifice (e.g., Isa. 34:6; Jer. 46:10; Ezek. 39:17–20; Zeph. 1:7).

<span id="page-696-17"></span><span id="page-696-16"></span><span id="page-696-14"></span><span id="page-696-13"></span><span id="page-696-9"></span>9:16–17 God will not only fight for and protect his people (vv. 14–15), he will also save and greatly bless them. The phrase "on that day" refers to the future day of salvation (cf. "those days" in 8:23). The Lord is called "their God," language associated with the covenant relationship (cf. 9:11; 10:6; 13:9). The people are called "the flock," introducing the shepherd imagery prominent in chapters 10–13 portraying God's relationship with Israel, and Israel's leadership. The people are also likened to "jewels of a crown" that "shall shine on his land"—precious stones in the ephod and breastplate of the high priest represented the people of Israel (Ex. 28:12, 21). Here God's people will adorn the land as jewels. It is a fitting image for God's "treasured possession" (cf. Ex. 19:5; Mal. 3:17).

<span id="page-696-8"></span><span id="page-696-5"></span><span id="page-696-2"></span><span id="page-696-1"></span><span id="page-696-0"></span>The glorious nature of this day results in the exclamation, "How great is his goodness, and how great his beauty!"35 This day of God's salvation will also bring the covenant blessings of "grain" and "new wine" (cf. Deut. 33:28; Joel 2:19; Amos 9:13). This produce will cause young men and women to "flourish" (or "bear fruit"; e.g., Ps. 92:14), perhaps implying offspring. Just as God had saved his people in the exodus, defeating their enemies and in time establishing them in the land under King David, so he will do it again, saving and establishing his people in the land under the one who will inherit David's throne.

He will do this for and through his future king (vv. 9–13) and for and through his people (vv. 14–17). The chapter draws on many episodes and prophecies from Israel's past to portray the future salvation of God's people. At the center is a portrait of a future king, a portrait created as a mosaic from different OT passages, particularly the suffering David of 2 Samuel and the Psalms, and Isaiah's servant. Like the hope of earlier prophets, the future king (or Messiah) will be righteous (Isa. 9:7; 11:4–5; 16:5; Jer. 23:5–6; 33:15–16). While the pride and wisdom of the nations will be reduced to nothing (Zech. 9:1–8), there is the opposite conjunction of power and weakness in the presentation of the future king: he is not a mighty warrior king who trusts in his own strength but a king who is saved by God. Like Isaiah's servant, he is afflicted; and like David in exile, he rides not on a warhorse but on a donkey. As in the prayer for David's son in Psalm 72:8, the future king will have a universal rule given to him by God (Zech. 9:10).

<span id="page-696-21"></span><span id="page-696-19"></span><span id="page-696-18"></span><span id="page-696-11"></span><span id="page-696-4"></span>All four Gospel writers record that Jesus acquired and rode a donkey into Jerusalem, claiming to be this king (Matt. 21:1–11; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–38; John 12:12–19). His righteousness and his affliction to the point of death as a servant (cf. Phil. 2:6–11) meant God "saved" him and vindicated him as Lord of all in his resurrection. Now through his gospel, Jesus proclaims "peace to the nations" (Zech. 9:10; cf. Eph. 2:14–18; Col. 1:20). The conjunction of power and weakness

<span id="page-696-20"></span><sup>35</sup> The ESV translates this exclamation to refer to the Lord. It possibly refers to the people ("How attractive and how beautiful they will be"; NIV) or to the future day of salvation ("How good it is and how beautiful it is"; AT).

seen in Messiah Jesus is the pattern for Christian ministry in the power of the gospel, a "treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us" (2 Cor. 4:7).

<span id="page-697-5"></span><span id="page-697-2"></span><span id="page-697-0"></span>The theme of the salvation of foreign nations seen at the end of Zechariah 8 continues into this part of the book, where a "remnant" from the nations will be incorporated into God's people as the Jebusites were in David's day (9:7). There is great hope here, for if God can save the idolatrous and unclean Philistines, he can presumably save anyone from the nations who takes up the Messiah's offer of peace (v. 10).

<span id="page-697-3"></span><span id="page-697-1"></span>The picture of a "warrior God" seen in this chapter and elsewhere in chapters 9–14 is understandably not popular today, given the conflict and war around our world. Yet the reality is that force is often needed to stop violence, and the point of the image is that ultimately God will bring warfare to an end. "By testifying that God is the Divine Warrior, the Bible is saying that the ultimate destruction of evil belongs to him."36 This will finally occur when Jesus returns, not on a donkey but on a white horse, striking down all who refuse to worship him (Rev. 19:11–21).

<span id="page-697-8"></span><span id="page-697-7"></span><span id="page-697-6"></span>While God's people are used as weapons in this passage, the NT explains that for followers of Jesus, "The weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh" (2 Cor. 10:4), that is, not the weapons armies use. Instead, they are spiritual weapons, including the "belt of truth . . . breastplate of righteousness . . . [shoes of] the gospel of peace . . . shield of faith . . . helmet of salvation, and . . . sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God . . . with all prayer and supplication" (Eph. 6:14–18).

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-699-11"></span>The focus of chapters 10–11 is leadership and its consequences for God's people. The predominant leadership image in these chapters is the shepherd. Indeed, this section of Zechariah provides another perspective on the battle portrayed in chapter 9—from the viewpoint of leadership.

The main idea of 10:1–11:3 is that the Lord will save his people from the nations and bring them back to the land. God will do this by raising up new leadership for his people and by judging foreign oppressors.

<span id="page-699-16"></span><span id="page-699-15"></span><span id="page-699-14"></span><span id="page-699-12"></span>Rather than being led by false mediums, the people are to call on the Lord to give them rain for their crops (10:1–2). God promises to punish their current foreign leaders and to raise up new leadership in their place (vv. 3–4). These new leaders will defeat their foe in battle (v. 5). God promises to save and bring back those from his people who remain scattered among the nations (vv. 6–11) so that they will reflect his character (v. 12). Like 9:11–17, this passage portrays God's salvation as a new exodus. God's intention to raise up new leadership and reunite his people will have devastating consequences for oppressive foreign leaders (11:1–3).

Pss. 65:9; 68:9; 135:7). The "season of the spring rain" is considered to be March/April. These rains were crucial for crops and survival in the land. In times of drought (cf. Hag. 1:10–11), the temptation would be to turn to "household gods" or "diviners" (Zech. 10:2). The "household gods" (*teraphim*) were idols used to determine the future (e.g., Gen. 31:19, 34; 1 Sam. 19:13, 16). Similarly, "diviners" sought to predict the future (e.g., Judg. 17:5; 18:14–20) and were consulted to determine the best time for planting crops. Yet these practices deceive—the household gods "utter nonsense" (or "speak evil") and the diviners "see lies"; their dreams are "false" and "give empty consolation." Moreover, these practices are forbidden in Israel's law (cf. Deut. 5:8–9; 18:9–14). Adopting them in the past led to exile and removal of the kings of Israel and Judah. Hence Zechariah warns against them.

<span id="page-699-8"></span><span id="page-699-7"></span><span id="page-699-5"></span><span id="page-699-3"></span><span id="page-699-2"></span><span id="page-699-1"></span>"Shepherd" refers metaphorically to a leader, particularly a king. It was a wellunderstood image, as shepherding was a central part of Israel's economy. Elsewhere the Lord is the shepherd of his people, his "flock" (e.g., Gen. 49:24; Ps. 23:1; cf. Zech. 9:16). Shepherding involves guiding (Ps. 77:20), protecting (Ps. 78:52), saving (Ezek. 34:22), gathering (Isa. 40:11), and nourishing (Jer. 50:19). Human leaders, such as Moses and David, are also called shepherds (Num. 12:7; Ps. 78:70–72). Since <span id="page-700-6"></span>the people did not have a human king in the postexilic period, the people were "afflicted for lack of a shepherd" (cf. Isa. 53:6; Jer. 50:6–7; Ezek. 34:5).

<span id="page-700-19"></span><span id="page-700-14"></span><span id="page-700-4"></span>10:3 God is angry with the shepherds and announces punishment on them ("leaders"). Elsewhere the word translated "leaders" (or "male goats") refers to foreign kings (e.g., Isa. 14:9; Ezek. 39:18). It probably refers here to those same rulers, whose judgment is announced in Zechariah 11:1–3. Since the people are said to lack a shepherd of their own (10:2), these shepherds and leaders are best understood to refer to the present foreign rulers of God's people.

<span id="page-700-13"></span><span id="page-700-12"></span><span id="page-700-8"></span>On the title "Lord of hosts," cf. comment on 1:2–6a. It underscores God's might as king and gives assurance he will punish these leaders and save his people (cf. 9:16), particularly the "house of Judah," whom he "will make . . . like his majestic steed in battle." The "steed" (or "battle horse") is a magnificent animal with great speed, energy, and power. In battle it could reach speeds of over 40 miles (64 km) per hour and would trample enemy troops (cf. 10:5).

<span id="page-700-17"></span><span id="page-700-16"></span><span id="page-700-5"></span>10:4–5 God will raise up alternate leadership for his people. Three leadership metaphors are used to convey the strength and stability they will provide for the houses of Judah and Joseph (cf. v. 6). The first is "cornerstone," a crucial stone contributing to the strength and stability of a building (cf. Isa. 28:16). This image of leadership is also found in Judges 20:2; 1 Samuel 14:38; and Isaiah 19:13. The image is apt because of the support it will be to the *house* of Judah and *house* of Joseph (Zech. 10:6).

<span id="page-700-18"></span><span id="page-700-2"></span><span id="page-700-1"></span>The second leadership image is "tent peg," an image found also in Isaiah 22:22–25. Pegs were used to secure the tabernacle tent (Ex. 27:19; Num. 3:37). In Hebrew thought, "tent" is somewhat interchangeable with "house," and so this leadership image is also to be understood as providing support to the houses of Judah and Joseph (called the "tents of Judah" in Zech. 12:7 and "tents of Joseph" in Ps. 78:67).

<span id="page-700-20"></span><span id="page-700-11"></span><span id="page-700-3"></span>The third image is "battle bow." This is not used as a leadership image elsewhere in the OT, although Judah is described as the Lord's bow in Zechariah 9:13. As an image of leadership, it conveys military strength and connects with the battle these leaders will fight in 10:5.

<span id="page-700-0"></span>All these leaders are said to come "from him," but it is uncertain to whom this refers. The Hebrew syntax suggests it is the Lord himself who will provide these leaders.37 On the other hand, elsewhere in the OT the nation's leadership, particularly its king, is said to come from Judah (e.g., Gen. 49:10). While both are true, on balance the former seems more likely here. Some scholars understand these images to all refer to the future Davidic king (referred to in Zech. 9:9). However, the plurality of rulers seen in the phrase "every ruler—all of them together" weighs against this. Yet the king is probably to be included in this group (cf. Jer. 23:3–6).38

<span id="page-700-15"></span><span id="page-700-10"></span><span id="page-700-7"></span><sup>37</sup> In verse 3, "the house of Judah" is a plural entity ("them"), rather than singular ("him").

<span id="page-700-9"></span><sup>38</sup> The word translated "ruler" is elsewhere mostly translated negatively as "tyrant" or "oppressor" (e.g., Zech. 9:8). However, Wolters, *Zechariah*, 324, argues it can simply mean "ruler" without negative connotations.

<span id="page-701-18"></span><span id="page-701-16"></span>It is also uncertain whether "they" (Zech. 10:5) refers to the leaders of verse 4. If the image of trampling the enemies is connected to the activities of the "majestic steed in battle" (v. 3), then "they" refers to the house of Judah. It may be significant that the word translated "mighty men" (*gibborim*) in verse 5 is the same word translated "mighty warrior" (*gibbor*) in verse 7, where it clearly refers to "Ephraim." This would support seeing "they" in verse 5 as the house of Judah, with the wider passage indicating that all Israel (Judah and Ephraim) will be raised up to fight (cf. 9:13). Significantly, in battle, "as many warriors were killed by the crushing blows of horses' hooves landing on vital body parts as by the random wounds of arrows and spears piercing the flesh."39 The subjects of 10:5 will fight alongside the presence of the Lord, ensuring their victory (cf. 9:14–16). They "shall put to shame the riders on horses"—proud enemies of the house of Judah (including the foreign shepherds and leaders of 10:3) will be overwhelmed.

<span id="page-701-17"></span><span id="page-701-15"></span><span id="page-701-13"></span><span id="page-701-12"></span><span id="page-701-10"></span><span id="page-701-6"></span>10:6–7 God will "strengthen the house of Judah" and "save the house of Joseph." "House of Joseph" is another name for the northern tribes (also called "Ephraim" in v. 7), devastated by the Assyrians in 722 BC as judgment for their sin (cf. 2 Kings 17). Here God promises to save and reunite the northern and southern kingdoms as one nation (cf. Zech. 9:1, 13). In his "compassion" the Lord will "bring them back" to the land—a key theme of chapters 1–8 (cf. 2:7; 6:15; 8:7); the judgment of exile will be over (cf. Deut. 30:1–10). The phrase "I am the Lord their God" echoes the typical covenant language found in Zechariah 8:8 and promises restoration of relationship. In addition, prayers will again be heard: "I will answer them" (cf. 7:13; 13:9).

<span id="page-701-11"></span><span id="page-701-9"></span><span id="page-701-8"></span><span id="page-701-7"></span><span id="page-701-4"></span>Like the house of Judah, which "shall be like mighty men" (10:5), so "Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior" (v. 7; cf. 9:13). God's commitment to strengthen and save all his people will result in joyful celebration (cf. 9:9). The benefits of this salvation will be appreciated by their children, who will also "rejoice in the Lord"—an Israelite ideal (cf. Deut. 6:2, 7).

<span id="page-701-20"></span><span id="page-701-19"></span><span id="page-701-14"></span><span id="page-701-2"></span><span id="page-701-1"></span>10:8–10 The promise of the Lord in verse 6 to bring his people back from exile is developed in the rest of the chapter (these verses echo Moses' prophecy of return in Deut. 30:1–10). God will "whistle for them" (Zech. 10:8), a sound made to gather sheep (cf. Judg. 5:16). He will "gather" the wandering flock (cf. Zech. 10:2) because he has "redeemed them" (cf. Deut. 7:8). While not explicit here, Zechariah 12–14 indicates this redemption is achieved through the death of the future Davidic king (cf. 9:9). The exiles of the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel had devastated their populations; now the Lord promises, "They shall be as many as they were before" (10:8; cf. Deut. 30:5; Jer. 23:3; Ezek. 36:11).

<span id="page-701-21"></span><span id="page-701-5"></span><span id="page-701-3"></span>God "scattered them among the nations" (Zech. 10:9), a reference to their exiles. Yet from exile "they shall remember me"—they will call to mind the reality of God and seek to return to his covenant requirements (cf. Deut. 30:1–2). This will result in life and blessing for the exiles and their children (cf. Gen. 50:23).

<span id="page-701-0"></span><sup>39</sup> Deborah O'Daniel Cantrell, *The Horsemen of Israel: Horses and Chariotry in Monarchic Israel (Ninth–Eighth Centuries B.C.E.)*, HACL 1 (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2011), 29, cf. 136–141.

<span id="page-702-15"></span><span id="page-702-4"></span><span id="page-702-3"></span>God will bring them back from "the land of Egypt" and "Assyria" (Zech. 10:10). These were traditional enemies of God's people and countries to which the Ephraimites were exiled. Reference to Egypt also brings to mind God's redemption and deliverance in the exodus. God will bring them "to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon." "Gilead" is the region of Transjordanian territory through which Moses first approached the Promised Land from Egypt (Deut. 3:10, 12–13, 15) and may here refer to the home of the exiles returning from Egypt. "Lebanon" is the northernmost extent of the Promised Land (Deut. 11:24; 1 Kings 9:19), to which exiles would arrive from Assyria. The people will fill these lands "till there is no room for them." Historically these regions had been relatively empty, and filling them speaks of God's great blessing. There may also be irony, because in Joshua 17, when the Promised Land was allocated, the people of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) complained there was not enough land for them, so they were given a double allotment. Here their blessing will be so great that they will encounter this problem again.

<span id="page-702-16"></span><span id="page-702-6"></span><span id="page-702-1"></span>10:11–12 The exodus imagery continues as God will "pass through the sea of troubles" (v. 11) and "strike down the waves of the sea," as he had done with the Egyptian army, bringing destruction (Ex. 14:27–28). This time, however, it will be "the Nile" rather than the Red Sea. God promises to humble the proud and powerful nations like Assyria and Egypt (Zech. 10:11; cf. Deut. 30:7). The "scepter" was a symbol of rule and power (cf. Gen. 49:10): Egypt's oppressive power will be removed.

<span id="page-702-14"></span><span id="page-702-5"></span><span id="page-702-0"></span>God promises to strengthen his people (Zech. 10:12; cf. v. 6), and "They shall walk in his name." This is a unique expression in the OT. Elsewhere, God's name represents his character and is associated with the conduct of his people (e.g., Ex. 20:7; Mal. 1:11). Restored relationship with the Lord will reshape their lives so that they reflect his character to the world (cf. Zech. 9:16–17).

<span id="page-702-17"></span><span id="page-702-13"></span><span id="page-702-12"></span><span id="page-702-8"></span><span id="page-702-2"></span>11:1–3 Kings are often portrayed in the OT as mighty trees (e.g., 2 Kings 14:9; Dan. 4:10–27). Here foreign kings or rulers are represented as "cedars" (Zech. 11:1), "cypress" (v. 2), and "oaks" (v. 2). In this taunt song, God announces his judgment on the kings or rulers of foreign nations who will be devoured by fire, felled, and ruined, so that God's people might return to the land. This is another dramatic presentation of the content of chapter 10.

<span id="page-702-11"></span><span id="page-702-7"></span>"Lebanon" (11:1; cf. 10:10) was known for its magnificent cedars and cypresses, used in the construction of the temple and the king's palace in Jerusalem (1 Kings 5:6; 7:2). "Bashan" (Zech. 11:2) had a reputation for its mighty oaks (Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6) and was known for its idolatry (Amos 4:1). In the earlier prophets, Lebanon and Bashan epitomized pride (e.g., Isa. 2:12–13). Here their rulers will be destroyed by the Lord.

<span id="page-702-18"></span><span id="page-702-10"></span><span id="page-702-9"></span>Mixing metaphors, these "shepherds" of the foreign nations (Zech. 11:3; cf. 10:3) are like "lions" ravaging and feeding on God's people (cf. Jer. 25:36–38). They will "wail" and "roar" as God saves and takes away those they had oppressed

and feasted on—his people. The "thicket of the Jordan" refers to fertile territory in Israel on the lower parts of the Jordan River and seems to be another reference to the ruin of Judah's Persian overlords, who have prospered at the expense of God's people. Alternatively, because of its location in the land, it might refer to Jewish leadership in cahoots with oppressive foreign powers.

### *Response*

<span id="page-703-1"></span>Like chapter 9, this passage portrays the future battle to establish God's kingdom, now from the perspective of the leadership of God's people. God promises to raise up new leadership for his people to fight for them and save them from the nations. He also promises to save those who were exiled and bring them back to the land and prosper them, removing oppressive foreign rulers. While a future Davidic king is not directly mentioned in chapter 10, when read against the expectation of chapter 9 the future king is probably to be understood as part of the leadership God will raise up to save his people (Zech. 10:4; cf. Jer. 23:3–6).

<span id="page-703-8"></span><span id="page-703-6"></span><span id="page-703-4"></span><span id="page-703-3"></span><span id="page-703-2"></span><span id="page-703-0"></span>From the perspective of the NT, the promised battle brings salvation (Zech. 10:6), expresses God's compassion (v. 6), causes joy for those who are saved (v. 7), brings the exiles home (vv. 6, 8–10), and is the supreme act of redemption, bringing about a new exodus (vv. 8, 11). It must be understood as the spiritual battle Jesus won on the cross to bring salvation. Jesus called himself the "good shepherd" who laid down his life for the sheep (John 10:10–15). Jesus also gave his disciples authority to fight on his behalf—not against flesh and blood but against the "spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (cf. Eph. 6:12). This battle climaxed in Jesus' death and resurrection but will continue to be engaged by the church until he returns. The restoration of the divided kingdom of Israel (Judah and Joseph), which this passage speaks of, is also brought about by Jesus. The book of Acts shows that the gospel is believed first in Jerusalem (the capital of Judah or "Judea"), then Samaria (the old capital of the northern kingdom), and, once Israel is reunited, the gospel then goes "to the end of the earth" (cf. Acts 1:8).

<span id="page-703-7"></span><span id="page-703-5"></span>While many of Israel's kings lead the people to follow the religious practices of the nations (including household gods and divination), this passage calls God's people to have nothing to do with these, but rather to recognize that God controls all things and to pray to him. Christians likewise are to depend on God in prayer for their daily provision (Matt. 6:11; Phil. 4:6).

## <span id="page-704-2"></span>ZECHARIAH 11:4–17

**<sup>4</sup>**Thus said the Lord my God: "Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter. **5**Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the Lord, I have become rich,' and their own shepherds have no pity on them. **6**For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the Lord. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand."

**<sup>7</sup>** So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named Favor, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep. **<sup>8</sup>** In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. **<sup>9</sup>** So I said, "I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another." **10**And I took my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples. **<sup>11</sup>** So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the Lord. **12**Then I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. **13**Then the Lord said to me, "Throw it to the potter"—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter. **14**Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

**<sup>15</sup>**Then the Lord said to me, "Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd. **16**For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.

**<sup>17</sup>** "Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be wholly withered, his right eye utterly blinded!"

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-704-1"></span><span id="page-704-0"></span>This passage comprises two sign-actions Zechariah is commissioned by the Lord to perform (11:4–14; 15–17). It links closely with chapter 10 and explains why God's people are currently oppressed by foreign shepherds (cf. 10:3). While some <span id="page-705-11"></span><span id="page-705-3"></span>interpret the first sign-action as a future prophecy, there is no agreement on how it is fulfilled, since it does not fit exactly with future events.40 In addition, if it is understood as future prophecy, there are elements contradicting other parts of Zechariah, such as "annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel" (11:14; cf. 8:13; 9:10, 13; 10:6–7; 12:12). Others interpret this passage as characterizing divisions within Zechariah's community, but this faces the same difficulties as the first interpretative approach. A third approach, which is here adopted since it coheres best with the wider message of the book, understands the first sign-action as representing the past and the second as representing the present. Zechariah is commissioned to play the role of Yahweh as shepherd in a portrayal of the nation's history to the time of the Babylonian exile in order to explain why God's people are ruled by oppressive foreign shepherds. The shepherd in the second sign-action represents contemporary oppressive leadership, against which God announces judgment.

## *Section Outline*

- V.C. Two Shepherd Sign-Actions (11:4–17)
	- 1. First Sign-Action: Division and Exile (11:4–14)
	- 2. Second Sign-Action: The Worthless Shepherd (11:15–17)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-705-5"></span><span id="page-705-1"></span>11:4 In the first sign-action, God calls Zechariah to play the role of "shepherd of the flock." In doing so he represents the Lord as "shepherd" to portray the history of his relationship with the "flock," the nation of Israel (cf. Jer. 12:3). The phrase "my God" indicates the close relationship between Zechariah and the Lord. The description of the flock as "doomed to slaughter" (also Zech. 11:7) anticipates verse 6, where God's judgment of Israel is portrayed.

<span id="page-705-9"></span><span id="page-705-8"></span><span id="page-705-7"></span><span id="page-705-4"></span>11:5–6 The reason for God's judgment of his people is given in these verses: "their own shepherds have no pity on them" (v. 5). Historically the leaders of the nation (particularly the kings) failed to rule with justice and righteousness. Rather than serving as good shepherds by guiding, protecting, saving, gathering, and nourishing the flock (cf. comment on 10:1–2), the leaders used the flock for their own advantage by selling them (11:5). This probably refers to political alliances with foreign kings that were costly and oppressive to God's people (e.g., 2 Kings 16:8; 17:3). To make matters worse, the sellers mock God by boasting, "Blessed be the Lord, I have become rich" (Zech. 11:5). Their pious words only mask greed; their actions show they have "no pity" or compassion for the flock (cf. Jer. 23:1–2; Ezekiel 34).

<span id="page-705-6"></span><span id="page-705-2"></span><span id="page-705-0"></span>The future tense in this section does not mean the sign-action represents the future; it is future only in the context of Zechariah's acting it out. The events represented in the sign-action have already happened. The same phenomenon

<span id="page-705-12"></span><span id="page-705-10"></span><sup>40</sup> Yet it is prophetic of the future in some respects, such as the "thirty pieces of silver" (v. 12) and Judas's betrayal of Jesus (Matt. 27:1–10). How this works is explored in the "Response" section.

Zechar iah 11:4–17 706

<span id="page-706-9"></span>occurs when Ezekiel is commanded to lie upon his side (future) in order to depict a period of 390 years that has already been running for centuries (cf. Ezek. 4:4–5).41

<span id="page-706-12"></span>God explains that his patience with his people and their leaders finally ran out. He declares, "I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land" (Zech. 11:6). Instead, God handed them over to their enemies, described as "his neighbor, and . . . his king." The judgment depicted in verse 6 fell upon the northern kingdom of Israel at the hands of the Assyrians and their king Shalmaneser in 722 BC (2 Kings 17). It fell upon the southern kingdom of Judah at the hands of the Babylonians and their king Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC (2 Kings 25). These events were devastating.

<span id="page-706-13"></span><span id="page-706-10"></span><span id="page-706-4"></span><span id="page-706-3"></span><span id="page-706-2"></span>11:7–9 Acting out the sign-action, Zechariah takes up two staffs to shepherd the flock.42 Shepherds used the staff to discipline sheep (e.g., Ezek. 20:37) and as a weapon against wild animals that might attack the sheep (e.g., 1 Sam. 17:43). A staff also provided stability for the shepherds as they walked (e.g., Ex. 12:11). These staffs are given the names "Favor" and "Union," explained in Zech. 11:10, 14.

<span id="page-706-16"></span><span id="page-706-0"></span>The one month in which Zechariah "destroyed the three shepherds" is difficult to determine. Some suggest "one month" represents a short space of time and refers to the removal of the last three kings of Judah (Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah) in quick succession. Another suggestion is that it refers to the one month in which Jerusalem fell and its leadership was exiled or killed (cf. Jer. 52:6, 12). In this case the "three shepherds" may represent the types of leadership that were removed at this time—king, prophets, and priests (cf. Jer. 52:10, 15, 24–27).

<span id="page-706-15"></span><span id="page-706-14"></span><span id="page-706-8"></span><span id="page-706-7"></span><span id="page-706-6"></span>Zechariah reports that the people "detested me." In doing so, they revealed their attitude toward God. After persevering with a rebellious people, God's patience eventually ran out (Zech. 11:8), so he ceased shepherding his people and handed them over to defeat by the nations and exile (v. 9). The chilling charge, "Let those who are left devour the flesh of one another," refers to what happens in the siege of a city when dead corpses are eaten for food due to desperate hunger. The book of Lamentations attests that this happened during the siege of Jerusalem before it fell (Lam. 2:20; 4:10; cf. Deut. 28:53; Jer. 19:9).

<span id="page-706-17"></span><span id="page-706-5"></span><span id="page-706-1"></span>11:10–11 Zechariah breaks the first staff, called "Favor" (this can also be translated "Grace" or "Kindness"). This staff represents the "covenant that I had made with all the peoples." While unusual, elsewhere the term "peoples" can refer to the whole nation of Israel, that is, "all the peoples" of Israel and Judah (cf. Isa. 3:13; Mic. 1:1–2). Hence, "covenant" most likely refers to the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai, mediated through Moses. Indeed, the judgment of exile was a curse threatened in the Mosaic covenant for rejecting God's covenant requirements

<span id="page-706-11"></span><sup>41</sup> See further M. R. Stead, "The Three Shepherds: Reading Zechariah 11 in the Light of Jeremiah," in J. A. Grant, Alison Lo, and G. J. Wenham, eds., *A God of Faithfulness: Essays in Honour of J. Gordon McConville on His 60th Birthday* (New York: T&T Clark, 2011), 149–165 (155–156).

<span id="page-706-18"></span><sup>42</sup> The phrase "sheep traders" follows the Septuagint. It is better to follow the MT here and translate "afflicted of the flock" (also v. 11). Cf. NIV, "So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock."

<span id="page-707-7"></span><span id="page-707-5"></span><span id="page-707-3"></span><span id="page-707-2"></span>(e.g., Deut. 28:36, 45–68). The breaking of the staff is explained as "annulling the covenant" (cf. Jer. 31:32; Ezek. 44:7). Elsewhere God promises never to break this covenant (Lev. 26:44; Judg. 2:1), and here he is certainly not breaking its terms. Rather, since the people have broken the covenant by detesting him and rejecting him as Lord, he declares the covenant annulled (cf. Ex. 32:19). Yet, while God handed his people over to the covenant curses, he still remained firmly committed to them—the rest of Zechariah indicates that God restored his people after exile and intends to bless them once again in a new covenant relationship.

Some of the "afflicted of the flock" (cf. note 42, above) recognize that the punishment is in accordance with the word of the Lord as set out in the covenant curses of Leviticus and Deuteronomy and reiterated by Israel's prophets.

<span id="page-707-12"></span><span id="page-707-1"></span>11:12–13 Zechariah gives the people an opportunity to pay him for his prophecies; they willingly accept, and pay him "thirty pieces of silver." In Exodus 21:32 this is the price of a slave, and it could be considered a reasonable sum. However, paying off Zechariah with any amount is an insult, indicating that the people have utterly rejected God as shepherd and are just as responsible as their leaders for God's judgment.

<span id="page-707-9"></span>Zechariah throws the money to the potter in the temple (Zech. 11:12), perhaps indicating he will not profit from his prophetic activity (cf. Amos 7:12). "Potter" can also be translated "molder" and may have been one who melted down metal to remit to Persia as taxes.

<span id="page-707-13"></span><span id="page-707-10"></span><span id="page-707-8"></span><span id="page-707-6"></span>11:14 The name of the second staff is "Union," conveying the idea of binding two parties together. Zechariah's breaking this staff represents the division of Solomon's kingdom into Israel under Jeroboam and Judah under Rehoboam (cf. 1 Kings 12). Elsewhere, Zechariah promises the reunion of Israel and Judah (e.g., Zech. 10:6–7; 12:12–14; cf. Ezek. 37:15–28). This first sign-action of breaking two staffs indicates that the division of the kingdom and the exile came about because the people persistently rejected the Lord as their shepherd. While historically these events happened the other way around, Zechariah's sign-action conveys these significant moments in the nation's history in a more general way.

<span id="page-707-14"></span><span id="page-707-11"></span><span id="page-707-4"></span><span id="page-707-0"></span>11:15–17 The second sign-action shows the people have received the leadership they deserved for their rejection of the Lord. Zechariah is instructed to "take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd." The equipment is not specified but could be another staff or some kind of clothing (e.g., Deut. 22:5) or weapon (e.g., Gen. 49:5). The description "foolish" indicates someone who rejects the Lord and engages in evil behavior. Here the "foolish shepherd" does not care for the weak and vulnerable of the flock or feed the healthy, but instead devours and feasts on the fat sheep of the flock, tearing off their hoofs like a lion. This connects to the lions of Zechariah 11:3, who represent foreign rulers presently ravaging and feeding on God's people. This sign-action reiterates that the Lord has raised up oppressive leadership in judgment on his people for their rejection of him as shepherd.

<span id="page-708-3"></span>The description "*my* worthless shepherd" (v. 17) indicates this shepherd functions as the Lord's agent even though he is "foolish." This description readily calls to mind foreign kings like Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus.

<span id="page-708-2"></span><span id="page-708-0"></span>The Lord's last word announces judgment on the "worthless shepherd" (v. 17). "Woe" often introduces a prophetic judgment oracle (e.g., Isa. 5:8; Jer. 23:1; Amos 5:18). This connects to Zechariah 10:3 and 11:1–3, which also announce the destruction of foreign shepherds. The coming judgment (a withered arm and blinded eye) will render the shepherd unable to continue his role.

## *Response*

The first sign-action reminds the people that the division of the kingdom of Israel and the experience of the destruction of the land and exile happened because the leaders of the nation and the people themselves rejected the Lord as their shepherd. Similarly, the second sign-action explains that their present destructive foreign leadership is their choice because of their rejection of the Lord; he has given them over to the consequences of their choices (cf. Rom. 1:18–2:11). God is a good shepherd whose concern is for the welfare of his sheep, but he will ultimately forsake in judgment those who persistently reject his care.

<span id="page-708-8"></span><span id="page-708-6"></span><span id="page-708-5"></span>Against the backdrop of foreign shepherds such as those portrayed in this chapter, Jesus claims, "I am the good shepherd" (John 10:11). In the life and ministry of Jesus, Zechariah's prophetic drama is played out on a bigger stage. Matthew's Gospel connects this sign-action with Judas's betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (Matt. 26:14–15; 27:9–10).43 The same pattern of God's people despising and rejecting him as their shepherd is repeated in the rejection of Jesus. Jesus came to bring "Favor" and "Union" but instead was rejected, betrayed, and killed. Yet Zechariah 12–14 will reveal that the death of the future Davidic shepherd-king is part of the purpose of God to bring forgiveness and a restored covenant relationship between God and his people.

<span id="page-708-12"></span><span id="page-708-11"></span><span id="page-708-10"></span><span id="page-708-9"></span><span id="page-708-7"></span><span id="page-708-4"></span>Today Jesus shepherds his people by his Word, written in the Bible and applied to people's hearts and minds by his Spirit (John 10:27; 14:26). The word "pastor" derives from the Latin translation of "shepherd," and church pastors are to serve under the "chief Shepherd," Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 5:4). Central to the pastoral role is teaching God's Word to give guidance, protection, and nourishment to God's people. Pastors are responsible to faithfully teach the flock (e.g., James 3:1), and the flock is accountable not only to hear the Word but to do it (James 1:22–25) and to obey those who shepherd them (Heb. 13:17).

<span id="page-708-1"></span><sup>43</sup> Matthew attributes this to Jeremiah, possibly because there is a combined allusion (cf. Jer. 19:1–13) and Jeremiah is the better known of the two prophets.

## <span id="page-709-1"></span>ZECHARIAH 12:1–13:1

12 The oracle of the word of the Lord concerning Israel: Thus declares the Lord, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the spirit of man within him: **<sup>2</sup>** "Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering to all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem will also be against Judah. **3**On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will surely hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will gather against it. **4**On that day, declares the Lord, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But for the sake of the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. **5**Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the Lord of hosts, their God.'

**<sup>6</sup>** "On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.

**<sup>7</sup>** "And the Lord will give salvation to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not surpass that of Judah. **8**On that day the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the Lord, going before them. **9**And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

**<sup>10</sup>** "And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. **11**On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. **12**The land shall mourn, each family*<sup>1</sup>* by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; **<sup>13</sup>** the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves; **<sup>14</sup>** and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.

13"On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-709-0"></span>A second prophetic oracle (chs. 12–14) offers another perspective on the battle against the nations that will establish God's kingdom (cf., e.g., the battle imagery <span id="page-710-4"></span><span id="page-710-3"></span>in 9:13–15; 10:5–7). The phrase "on that day" occurs seventeen times in these three chapters and refers to the day when the Lord will establish his kingdom on earth in glory. Occurring as often as it does, the phrase regularly directs the reader and hearer to the future. These chapters also indicate that central to the coming day is the future Davidic king (cf. 9:9). Yet, perhaps unexpectedly, it is through the piercing and the striking of the shepherd-king that cleansing from sin and restored covenant relationship will occur.

<span id="page-710-14"></span><span id="page-710-8"></span><span id="page-710-2"></span>Chapter 12 prophesies a future offensive by the nations against Jerusalem, yet the Lord promises to save and strengthen his people (vv. 1–9). In the aftermath of this battle, the people will mourn and grieve the one they have pierced (vv. 10–14), and God will bring cleansing (13:1). Chapter 12 is closely linked to the oracles of chapter 13.

<span id="page-710-16"></span><span id="page-710-15"></span>This section reveals that God's kingdom will not come without great cost to God's people and their king, but the final outcome will be glorious—the people will be saved and cleansed from sin. The main idea is that while God's people face a tumultuous future, at each and every point God will powerfully act to bring salvation.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-710-9"></span><span id="page-710-6"></span><span id="page-710-1"></span>12:1 The second prophetic oracle is titled the same as the first (cf. 9:1 and comment). This oracle concerns "Israel," which is striking against the background of chapter 11, since there Zechariah broke the "Union" staff to annul the "brotherhood between Judah and Israel" (11:14). This prophecy looks toward the time when God's people will again be united (cf. 10:6).

<span id="page-710-7"></span><span id="page-710-5"></span><span id="page-710-0"></span>Since "the Lord" translates the personal name "Yahweh," the description of the Lord as Creator is an implicit claim to the uniqueness of the God of Israel. God "stretched out the heavens" like a tent and "founded the earth" like the foundation of a building being laid. He created not only the vastness of the universe but also each person's "spirit" (cf. Gen. 2:7). God's power in creation is also a guarantee that the prophetic word will come to pass; he is well able to recreate the nation. His creative power is seen also in that he will "*make* Jerusalem a cup of staggering" (Zech. 12:2), "will *make* Jerusalem a heavy stone" (v. 3), and "will *make* the clans of Judah like a blazing pot" (v. 6)—creative actions showing his power and dominion over the nations (cf. 14:6–9).

<span id="page-710-17"></span><span id="page-710-13"></span><span id="page-710-12"></span><span id="page-710-11"></span>12:2 A future attack on Jerusalem is envisaged. Yet, when Jerusalem is under "siege," God will repel those who attack; he will "make Jerusalem a cup of stag<span id="page-711-1"></span>gering to all the surrounding peoples"—they will be knocked off balance as if drunk, possibly with fear. In Isaiah 51:17, 22, "cup of staggering" is used in parallel to "cup of his [God's] wrath," referring to the punishment upon Jerusalem when the city was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. In Zechariah this is reversed and Jerusalem will be the agent of God's wrath against those who come against it.

While difficult to translate, it seems the "cup of staggering," not "the siege," "will also be against Judah." It seems that Judah (referring to the inhabitants of the region around Jerusalem) is initially caught up with the nations in opposition to Jerusalem (possibly by coercion) and also drinks the cup (to a limited extent) that makes the surrounding peoples stagger (it is a city, not a region, that is subject to siege; cf. also Zech. 14:14). Later Judah has a change of heart (12:5) and fights *for* Jerusalem (v. 6).

<span id="page-711-8"></span><span id="page-711-6"></span><span id="page-711-5"></span><span id="page-711-4"></span>12:3–4 On the day the nations gather against Jerusalem, the Lord will defend it. God will make Jerusalem a "heavy stone" (v. 3) that injures "all who lift it." The exact nature of this stone is difficult to discern. Is it a stone dropped over the city wall on those who have laid siege to it? A stone of a partly broken city wall that injures those who try to remove it in order to break through? A stone used in ancient weightlifting competitions that often "hurt" those who tried to lift it? Or is the prophet merely making a statement that is true of any heavy stone? In any case, Jerusalem will prove to be immovable. In addition, the horses of the nation used in warfare (cf. comment on 10:3) will be put out of action (12:4). The horses will be struck with panic and blindness, and the riders will be struck with madness, thwarting their attack. These are covenant curses in Deuteronomy 28:28, but here they are afflicting Jerusalem's enemies. Yet, as God repels the attacking nations, he promises to keep his "eyes open" for the sake of the house of Judah—they will not be harmed. This statement also suggests Judah is initially caught up with the nations in this attack on Jerusalem (cf. Zech. 12:2).

<span id="page-711-7"></span><span id="page-711-3"></span><span id="page-711-0"></span>12:5–6 When the "clans of Judah" see God defending Jerusalem and presumably protecting them amid the ensuing disarray described in verse 4, they have a change of heart (v. 5).44 God now promises to make them agents of his destruction against the peoples who come against Jerusalem (v. 6). Since they have effectively infiltrated the enemy, they will attack them from the inside and consume them. Two images convey a spreading destructive presence: a "blazing pot" (alternatively "pot of fire") "in the midst of wood" and a "flaming torch among sheaves." The outcome is that "Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place"—it will be saved (cf. 9:9, 16; 10:6) and will occupy its proper place.

<span id="page-711-9"></span><span id="page-711-2"></span>12:7 The day of salvation will be glorious for Jerusalem and the house of David. In order for the "tents of Judah" not to miss out on this "glory" (or "fame"), they are saved "first." This also reflects Judah's pivotal role in bringing salvation to the city

<sup>44</sup> A "clan" is larger than a family but smaller than a tribe. It is defined by kinship and territory, with obligations within the "clans of Judah" to support one another.

<span id="page-712-19"></span><span id="page-712-2"></span>in verse 6. The "tents" of Judah in this martial context may refer to the dwelling of soldiers in the field (cf. 1 Sam. 17:54).

<span id="page-712-20"></span><span id="page-712-15"></span><span id="page-712-14"></span><span id="page-712-6"></span>The "house of David" is mentioned five times in Zechariah 12:7–13:1. The Davidic king was removed from the throne in Jerusalem when it was destroyed by Babylon in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:7). Zechariah earlier expresses the hope for a coming king from the house of David as central to his restoration program (Zech. 3:8; 6:12; 9:9). This is also in line with the hope of earlier prophets and the promises of the Davidic covenant, including an eternal throne for one of David's descendants (2 Sam. 7:13, 16; cf. 23:5).45 This verse indicates the house of David is a recognized entity in the postexilic period, presumably because of this hope, associated with it, for a future king.

<span id="page-712-22"></span><span id="page-712-21"></span><span id="page-712-11"></span><span id="page-712-3"></span><span id="page-712-1"></span>12:8–9 God promises to protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, strengthening the feeblest so that they "shall be like David" (v. 8). This alludes to the strength God gave David to defeat Israel's enemies in battle, which he demonstrated many times, not least in defeating the mighty Goliath and the Philistines (1 Samuel 17). Furthermore, "The house of David shall be like God" (Zech. 12:8). This bold comparison is best understood in functional terms, particularly since it is explained that they shall be "like the angel of the Lord, going before them." The "angel of the Lord" (cf. comment on 1:11–12) led and protected God's people on many occasions, particularly in the exodus (Ex. 13:21; 14:19; 33:2). Elsewhere, David is likened to an "angel of God," enabling him to lead the Israelites (2 Sam. 14:17, 20; 19:27). Given this background, it seems the house of David's being like God means they will once again lead and protect God's people, as God himself did. Presumably this leadership of the house of David will be mediated through the future king of Zechariah 9:9 (the Messiah), underscoring a continued Davidic hope in the postexilic period.

<span id="page-712-17"></span><span id="page-712-16"></span><span id="page-712-12"></span><span id="page-712-5"></span><span id="page-712-4"></span><span id="page-712-0"></span>Verse 9 of chapter 12 summarizes God's action in verses 1–8 and functions to give assurance to God's people that he will act in their interests. The destruction of nations hostile to Jerusalem is a theme found throughout Zechariah (cf. 1:15; 2:9; 6:8; 9:1–8, 13–15; 10:5, 7, 11; 11:1–3; 14:1–3; 12–15; 17–19).

<span id="page-712-23"></span><span id="page-712-18"></span><span id="page-712-13"></span>12:10 Victory and salvation turn to bitter weeping as the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem look on one whom they have pierced, apparently in the battle described in 12:1–9. Such piercing normally led to death, which seems likely here (cf. 13:3; Isa. 13:15; Lam. 4:9).

<span id="page-712-9"></span><span id="page-712-8"></span>God says he will "pour out . . . a spirit" (*ruakh*), which could refer to a disposition he gives his people. Yet the promise in the earlier prophets that God will send his Spirit on the day of salvation (e.g., Isa. 44:3–5; Ezek. 39:29; Joel 2:28–29) makes it more likely that it is God's Spirit being poured out here to produce "grace and pleas for mercy" among God's people—signs of repentance. In either case, it is God who changes his people so that they "mourn . . . as one mourns for an only

<span id="page-712-10"></span><span id="page-712-7"></span><sup>45</sup> Cf. Isaiah 9:6–7; 11:1–10; 16:5; Jeremiah 23:3–6; 33:14–22; Ezekiel 37:21–25; Hosea 3:5; Micah 4:8–5:5; Amos 9:11–15.

child, and weep bitterly . . . as one weeps over a firstborn." These expressions convey desperate and profound anguish and sorrow at the one they have "pierced." The "firstborn" was the heir and represented the people's future.

<span id="page-713-9"></span><span id="page-713-8"></span>Who is the one they have pierced? The pronouns "me . . . him . . . him" suggest the people pierced God (metaphorically) and a closely associated third party (concretely). The immediate and wider contexts of Zechariah point to this third party intimately associated with God as the future king of the "house of David" (cf. 3:8; 6:12; 9:9), the shepherd struck in 13:7–9. The king in Israel was understood to be the agent of the Lord's rule on earth (e.g., Psalm 72). Hence to pierce the king is also in some sense to pierce God. Indeed, the close connection between God and his anointed (seen, e.g., in Ps. 45:6; Isa. 9:6) explains how the death of the Messiah also "pierced" God. The reason for the piercing becomes clearer in Zechariah 13.

<span id="page-713-12"></span><span id="page-713-10"></span><span id="page-713-6"></span><span id="page-713-5"></span><span id="page-713-4"></span>12:11 This verse alludes to the death of another Davidic king, Josiah, pierced in a battle at Megiddo (2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chron. 35:20–25). Josiah's death is a pattern of the king to come—both are pierced, and the people mourn both deeply.

<span id="page-713-14"></span>Rather than treating "Hadad-rimmon" as a reference to a pagan god (suggested by "for Hadad-rimmon"), it is better to read it as a place in the plain of Megiddo, since a reference to pagan mourning is unlikely in this context.46 Even though "Hadad-rimmon" is otherwise unknown, Zechariah 14:10 refers to a Rimmon south of Jerusalem. Since there was more than one Rimmon (cf. also Josh. 15:32; Judg. 20:45; 1 Chron. 4:32), "Hadad" functions to specify which one is meant.

<span id="page-713-11"></span><span id="page-713-3"></span><span id="page-713-2"></span>12:12–14 The extent of the mourning continues to be described, and its vast extent across the land suggests that the one who died is a royal figure. The references to the "house of David" and "house of Levi" specify the royal and priestly families. However, the references to the "house of Nathan" and "family of the Shimeites" are more difficult to determine, since they are somewhat obscure subsidiary family members (cf. Nathan in 2 Sam. 5:14 and Shimei in Num. 3:21). Yet they may have had genealogical significance (seen, e.g., in Luke 3:31, where royal descent is traced through Nathan rather than Solomon). In this case the royal and priestly families will lead the people in repentance.

<span id="page-713-15"></span><span id="page-713-0"></span>The repeated phrase "by itself, and their wives by themselves" indicates the whole community is involved. There may be a sense in which "by themselves" conveys the genuineness of the repentance. The mention of "wives" (or "women") indicates the equal responsibility they bear for sin and their equal need for repentance (cf. Jer. 44:9). It may also reflect the cultural practice of segregating male and female mourners at funerals.

<span id="page-713-13"></span><span id="page-713-7"></span><span id="page-713-1"></span>13:1 Water is used for cleansing in the Torah (e.g., Num. 8:5–14). A "fountain" or "spring" suggests an abundant and ongoing supply of water and anticipates the "living waters" Zechariah 14:8 says will flow from Jerusalem. While sacrifice is normally required for purification from sin, washing is used as an image of

The close connection of this verse with Zechariah 12 implies that cleansing "from sin and uncleanness" follows the death of the Messiah and the pouring out of the Spirit (v. 10; cf. 3:8–9). It is particularly said to be for those who were responsible for the piercing in 12:10—"the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."

#### *Response*

<span id="page-714-6"></span>Zechariah's second oracle (chs. 12–14) reveals that the coming of God's kingdom will not be without cost to God's people. Chapter 12 pictures a "day" when the nations (and initially Judah also) will lay siege to Jerusalem, yet God will act to repel the nations. He will turn the hearts of the clans of Judah so that they destroy the attacking nations and restore Jerusalem to its rightful place. This judgment on the nations reflects the promises to Abraham that "him who dishonors you I will curse" (Gen. 12:3). The emphasis of the passage falls on God's actions to strengthen his people and defend his city, giving assurance to God's people that although things may appear tumultuous, the Lord is working out his salvation purposes.

<span id="page-714-1"></span><span id="page-714-0"></span>When is this "day" when the nations and the people of Israel ("clans of Judah") gather against Jerusalem? When is the battle in which God and the Davidic king are pierced? The NT interprets it as the day God's holy servant Jesus, the Messiah, was crucified. For instance, Acts 4:24–28 cites Psalm 2, which has similar themes (the raging of the Gentiles against the Lord and his Messiah). Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, conspired against the anointed one, Jesus. Significantly, this happened "in this city," i.e., Jerusalem. The death of Jesus was the day of salvation for God's people and the day of judgment for God's enemies. The piercing of Jesus on the cross by a Roman soldier's spear (John 19:34–37) is seen to fulfill Zechariah 12:10, and in Revelation 1:7 Jesus is described as being "pierced." In addition, the NT explains that Jesus' death offers the ultimate cleansing from sin and uncleanness, bringing forgiveness (e.g., Matt. 26:28; Eph. 1:7; 5:26; Col. 1:14). The terrible irony is that the death that brought salvation and cleansing came at the hands of God's own people.

<span id="page-714-10"></span><span id="page-714-9"></span><span id="page-714-8"></span><span id="page-714-7"></span><span id="page-714-4"></span>After Jesus' death, God's Spirit was poured out on the God-fearing Jews in Jerusalem, who "were cut to the heart" and repented (Acts 2:32–37). While Zechariah 1–8 consistently calls the people to repentance (e.g., 1:3–6; 7:3), this passage shows that ultimately repentance is a gift of God by his Spirit, poured out as a result of the Messiah's death (note how grace precedes the people's pleas for mercy in 12:10). Similarly, the NT teaches that repentance is a result of the regeneration and rebirth God graciously works in the believer by his Spirit (cf. Titus 3:4–7). Repentance not only marks the beginning of the Christian life; it also characterizes the daily experience of the believer, turning from sin to obedience to the Lord.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-715-3"></span>This passage is closely connected to chapter 12. In 12:10–13:1, God promises to grant his people repentance and cleanse them from sin and uncleanness. The oracle that follows in this section promises the removal of idolatry, false prophecy, and the spirit of uncleanness in the land, with a special focus on the elimination of false prophets (13:2–6).

The main idea of this passage is that the land will be thoroughly cleansed from sin and uncleanness in the aftermath of the Messiah's death.

### *Section Outline*

VI.B. Cleansing the Land (13:2–6)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-715-5"></span><span id="page-715-4"></span>13:2 The repetition of the phrase "on that day" continues from chapter 12 (cf. Section Overview of 12:1–13:1). It is the day when God will establish his kingdom on earth in glory, and here God promises to remove things opposed to his reign.

<span id="page-715-2"></span><span id="page-715-1"></span><span id="page-715-0"></span>Idolatry and false prophecy were often associated in preexilic times (e.g., 1 Kings 22; Jer. 6:13–14) and were the chief sins that led to exile (e.g., Ezek. 22:3–15; 24:13; 39:24). While idolatry is not condemned nearly as frequently in the postexilic prophets, there are indications of its presence in the community in Zechariah's seventh night vision (5:5–11) and also in 10:2 (along with divination). God will "cut off the names of the idols from the land"—he will eliminate both the idols themselves <span id="page-716-4"></span>and also the powers attributed to them and any means of relationship or worship (cf. Hos. 2:17). God's people will have no enduring memory of the idols ("They shall be remembered no more"). Instead, they will call on the name of the Lord (cf. Zech. 13:9).

<span id="page-716-10"></span>The "prophets" to be removed are to be understood as false prophets. The OT does not use the term "false prophet"; it must be determined from the context. While some argue Zechariah is speaking about the cessation of prophecy in the contemporary and future ages, this is very unlikely.47 The removal of these prophets is elaborated upon in verses 3–6, where it is clear that they are false.

<span id="page-716-11"></span><span id="page-716-5"></span>The phrase "spirit of uncleanness" is not found elsewhere in the OT. Here it is associated with false prophecy in contrast with God's Spirit, who is associated with true prophecy in 7:12 (cf. also 4:6). The "spirit of uncleanness" also forms a contrast with the "spirit of grace" in 12:10.

<span id="page-716-8"></span><span id="page-716-6"></span><span id="page-716-1"></span>13:3 The treachery of false prophecy for God's people is underscored by the penalty that will come on those who practice it—even the parents of the false prophet, who presumably deeply love their child, will "pierce him through" when he prophesies (v. 3; cf. Deut. 13:6–11). The Hebrew for "pierce" (*daqar*) is the same verb as in Zechariah 12:10, perhaps to make a comparison between the sinful piercing of God and his king, resulting in cleansing, and the cleansing to come through the (sinful) prophet's being pierced. There may also be an echo of the priest Phinehas's bold action in Numbers 25:7–8, where he pierces (using the same verb) the Israelite and Midianite couple who blatantly sleep with each other in the Israelite camp, quickly bringing a stop to their sin. This verse claims that "on that day" God's people will no longer tolerate sin and uncleanness in their community.

<span id="page-716-9"></span><span id="page-716-3"></span><span id="page-716-0"></span>13:4–6 Every false prophet will be "ashamed of his vision" and will seek to cover up his past. He will no longer dress like a prophet with a "hairy cloak" (cf. the dress of Elijah in 1 Kings 19:13; 2 Kings 1:8). Instead he will pretend to have always been a "worker of the soil" (Zech. 13:5), or farmer, possibly as an indentured slave ("a man sold me in my youth").

<span id="page-716-2"></span>Furthermore, they will explain away the "wounds" they may have received from their false prophetic activity (v. 6; cf. Deut. 14:1; 1 Kings 18:28). They will claim to have received them "in the house of my friends." It is difficult to know exactly who these "friends" are; the phrase can also be translated "the ones who love me." Suggestions include parents, where the wounds are a result of discipline; or fellow idolaters, where the wounds result from worship together; or friends, where the wounds may result from a drunken brawl or simply an accident. In any case, the false prophet will be unmasked and removed from the land on that day.

the land from practices that defile it (vv. 2–6). This passage shows that there is no place in God's kingdom for idolatry, false prophecy, or impurity. Idolatry seeks to manipulate God or the gods by making a representation of the god and seeking to manipulate it for a positive outcome. At the heart of idolatry is greed (cf. Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5).48 There is no place for it in the church (cf., e.g., Rev. 2:14–16, 20–23).

When Jesus returns, the "false prophet" will be thrown into the lake of sulfur, along with the devil and the beast (Rev. 20:10). Until that time, Christians are to reject false prophecy (cf. Isa. 44:24–26; Acts 16:16–24; 19:19; Gal. 5:20; Rev. 21:8; 22:15). Guidance for God's people today comes from listening to the Word of God and seeking to live in a way that displays his justice and righteousness, obeying the commands of Jesus and his apostles (2 Tim. 3:15–17; James 1:16–25).

#### *Section Overview*

This short poetic oracle is very significant in the message of Zechariah. It contains the final reference to a "shepherd" and brings together the various elements of the leadership theme developed throughout the book. Following the previous passage, which concerned the cleansing of the land (13:2–6), this oracle speaks of further adversity for God's people as they go through another exile-like experience. God commands the striking of his shepherd, resulting in great loss to the flock, but

those who emerge will be refined by fire and will enter into a restored covenant relationship with the Lord.

## *Section Outline*

VI.C. The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep Scattered (13:7–9)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-718-10"></span><span id="page-718-9"></span>13:7 The Lord commands that a sword be drawn to strike "my shepherd . . . the man who stands next to me." The verb "strike" (*nakah*) is different from the one translated "pierced" in 12:10 and "pierce" in 13:3 (*daqar*), but as in both of those contexts, striking with the sword here implies the death of the one struck. The pronoun "my" and the description of the shepherd as standing next to the Lord (which can be translated "my associate" or "my friend") indicate the shepherd's close relationship with the Lord. It is therefore a different shepherd from the "foolish" and "worthless" shepherd of 11:15–17. However, it is not immediately clear who this shepherd is or why the Lord commands his death.

<span id="page-718-8"></span><span id="page-718-3"></span>Striking the shepherd will result in the sheep being scattered, including the "little ones" coming under God's judgment. The "little ones" are most naturally the sheep that are scattered, perhaps specifically identifying the lambs of the flock under God's judgment, indicating its severity. The only king said to have been killed with the sword was Zedekiah (Jer. 21:7), and his death coincided with the scattering of God's people in exile. Just as Zechariah drew on the episode with King Josiah in 12:10, so here he may be drawing on the death of another Judahite king to portray a future judgment of God's people.

<span id="page-718-7"></span>The wider expectation raised from earlier in the book suggests this struck shepherd is the future Davidic king who was earlier said to be pierced in the battle to establish God's kingdom (Zech. 12:10; cf. 3:8; 6:12; 9:9). This oracle indicates the death of the shepherd-king will be God's intent and design. There are many similarities here with Isaiah's presentation of the suffering servant, who suffers death on behalf of God's people by God's intent (cf. Isa. 53:6, 10).49

<span id="page-718-12"></span><span id="page-718-11"></span><span id="page-718-2"></span><span id="page-718-1"></span><span id="page-718-0"></span>13:8–9 The extent of this judgment will be devastating: "Two thirds [of the flock] shall be cut off and perish" (v. 8). The "third" (vv. 8, 9) that remains will be refined and tested in fire, just like the precious metals "silver" and "gold" (cf. Isa. 1:24–26). To "refine" a metal is to subject it to high temperatures to burn off impurities. To "test" the metal is to prove or determine its quality after being refined. The notion of refining a remnant is common in the prophets (e.g., Isa. 1:8–9; Amos 3:21; Mic. 5:7–8; 7:18; Mal. 3:2–4). In many instances, refining is a metaphor for the exile, from which a purified people of God would emerge. Dividing into thirds also brings to mind Ezekiel 5:1–4, where judgment falls on God's people, with a third burned with fire, a third struck by the sword, and a third scattered to the wind and chased by an unsheathed sword (v. 2).

<span id="page-719-1"></span>Those who survive and emerge from the refining fire will enjoy a restored covenant relationship with God. The language "They are my people . . . The Lord is my God" is classic covenant language (cf. Zech. 2:11; 8:8; 9:16). Jeremiah 31:33 uses this language to speak of the "new covenant," which seems to be in view here in Zechariah as well—the people emerging from the future judgment will enter a new covenant relationship with the Lord. A great privilege of this relationship is answered prayer: "They will call upon my name, and I will answer them" (cf. Zech. 10:6). The wider prophetic unit (12:1–14:21) indicates the people will have to endure another exile-like experience "on that day" when the future Davidic king is struck and the people are refined, before the covenant relationship and its blessings are realized.

This prophetic oracle provides another perspective on the coming day of the Lord. It reveals that the death of the future shepherd-king is God's own purpose and design. The connection of these themes with the Messiah emerges when this oracle is read against the rest of Zechariah. The earlier promises regarding the "Branch" connect his coming with the removal of the iniquity of the land in a single day (3:8–9) and indicate he will serve as priest (6:12–13). Zechariah 12:10 and 13:7 indicate it is through the death of the king that the people and the land will be cleansed from sin and uncleanness.

<span id="page-719-6"></span><span id="page-719-5"></span><span id="page-719-3"></span>Jesus quotes this oracle and explains it in terms of his own imminent death (cf. Matt. 26:31; Mark 14:27), which will establish the new covenant (exactly the idea present in Zech. 13:9). Jesus understands the image of striking with the sword to be a metaphor for his crucifixion. In addition, the gospel writers see the scattering of the flock fulfilled when the disciples desert Jesus at his arrest (Matt. 26:31, 56; Mark 14:27, 49–50).

<span id="page-719-10"></span><span id="page-719-9"></span><span id="page-719-8"></span><span id="page-719-7"></span>The response this calls for from God's people today is to confess, "The Lord is my God!" and to pray to him as an expression of the new covenant relationship that has come in Christ Jesus (1 Thess. 5:17). Christians should also expect various trials, "so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 1:7).

## <span id="page-720-0"></span>ZECHARIAH 14:1–21

14 Behold, a day is coming for the Lord, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst. **2**For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city shall go out into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. **3**Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle. **4**On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley, so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward. **5**And you shall flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.*<sup>1</sup>*

**<sup>6</sup>**On that day there shall be no light, cold, or frost.*<sup>2</sup>* **<sup>7</sup>**And there shall be a unique*<sup>3</sup>* day, which is known to the Lord, neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light.

**<sup>8</sup>**On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea*<sup>4</sup>* and half of them to the western sea.*<sup>5</sup>* It shall continue in summer as in winter.

**<sup>9</sup>**And the Lord will be king over all the earth. On that day the Lord will be one and his name one.

**<sup>10</sup>**The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. **11**And it shall be inhabited, for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction.*<sup>6</sup>* Jerusalem shall dwell in security.

**<sup>12</sup>**And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.

**<sup>13</sup>**And on that day a great panic from the Lord shall fall on them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other. **14**Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem.*<sup>7</sup>* And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance. **15**And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever beasts may be in those camps.

**<sup>16</sup>**Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Booths. **17**And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no rain on them. **18**And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-721-5"></span><span id="page-721-3"></span>Chapter 14 uses well-known images from Israel's past to picture God's coming kingdom. It is closely connected to chapters 12–13, with the phrase "on that day" occurring a further seven times. Chapter 14 offers another perspective on the nations' attack of Jerusalem, in which God will fight and deliver his people. It reveals again that God's kingdom will come at great cost to his people and will refine a remnant (cf. 13:7–9). It also brings the themes of the book to a climax, as the survivors (including those from the nations) either recognize his kingship and uniqueness or else suffer his punishment. In this chapter, the return of the Lord to his people affects the whole creation.

<span id="page-721-4"></span><span id="page-721-2"></span><span id="page-721-1"></span><span id="page-721-0"></span>There are many similarities in this chapter with the battle against Gog of Magog in Ezekiel 38–39, where Gog comes with a coalition of nations to invade the "land that is restored from war" (Ezek. 38:8)—a description that to some extent fits Israel after they have been "gathered from many peoples" (i.e., postexile).50 God responds to the invasion with earthquake and plague and by turning soldiers against each other so that God's holy name is known among Israel and the nations (Ezek. 38:16, 23; 39:7).The main idea conveyed in this chapter is that God will return to Jerusalem, defeat all his enemies, be recognized as the one true King, and cleanse the land and his people so that they might worship him in all holiness. The NT applies the language and images in this chapter to both the first and second comings of Jesus. Hence there is a "now and not yet" perspective on its fulfillment. The kingdom has been inaugurated with Jesus' death and resurrection and will be fully realized at his return.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-722-18"></span>14:1–2 "Behold" introduces a new section of the second oracle (chs. 12–14) and calls attention to something newsworthy or unexpected: Jerusalem will face another exile-like experience. This passage indicates there will be an offensive by the nations against Jerusalem, resulting in great devastation to its inhabitants. This is not a battle subsequent to that of 12:2–9 but another perspective on the same battle, this time looking at what it and the coming of God's kingdom entail for the entire cosmos. The "day . . . coming" is the same "day" mentioned ten times in chapters 12–13.

<span id="page-722-19"></span><span id="page-722-17"></span><span id="page-722-14"></span><span id="page-722-12"></span><span id="page-722-2"></span>The picture in these verses replays the past, when Jerusalem was attacked and captured by the nations in battle (14:2), with "spoil taken" and "divided" in the midst of God's people (v. 1) and with many of the people being sent "into exile" (v. 2; cf. 2 Kings 25). This earlier attack happened at the hands of the Babylonians in 586 BC (cf. Zech. 11:5–6). The "spoil" refers to property captured by an invading army, including prisoners, precious metals, food, livestock, textiles, and garments (e.g., Ezek. 38:13).

<span id="page-722-15"></span><span id="page-722-11"></span><span id="page-722-4"></span>Like the earlier destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians, the future attack on the city is said to be at the Lord's initiative ("I will gather all the nations"). The reason is not explicit, but in the context of chapter 13 it probably functions as a refining judgment on account of sin.51 The raping of women is a common feature of warfare and here depicts its horror and sheer awfulness (cf. Isa. 13:16); it is one of the covenant curses associated with exile in Deuteronomy 28:30. Half of the inhabitants of the city will be taken into exile, but the other half will remain.

<span id="page-722-21"></span><span id="page-722-10"></span><span id="page-722-9"></span><span id="page-722-3"></span><span id="page-722-1"></span>14:3 Just when things look desperate, God will go out (presumably from heaven) and fight for his people against the nations who have come against Jerusalem (cf. again 12:2–9). God is depicted as a warrior elsewhere in Zechariah, but whereas earlier passages in chapters 9–14 describe him as using his people as instruments of his judgment (e.g., 9:13–15; 10:5, 7; 12:2–3; 6), here God fights directly (cf. also 6:5, where God sends out his heavenly chariots to bring judgment on the nations). The phrase "as when he fights on a day of battle" points to past victories the Lord won for his people (e.g., Ex. 15:1–21; Josh. 10:14, 42; 23:3; Judg. 4:15; 1 Sam. 7:10). These give assurance that God will defeat the nations again on the coming day.

<span id="page-722-22"></span><span id="page-722-8"></span><span id="page-722-7"></span><span id="page-722-6"></span><span id="page-722-0"></span>14:4 The return of the Lord to Jerusalem is a key theme of the book (cf. 1:3; 2:5, 10–11; 4:9–10; 8:3; 9:8, 14). When God comes to save his people, he will shake the heavens and the earth (cf. Hag. 2:6, 21–22). With bold anthropomorphism, God's

<span id="page-722-20"></span><span id="page-722-16"></span><span id="page-722-5"></span><sup>51</sup> The Hebrew noun that is translated "the rest" (*yeter*) in verse 2 has the same root as the verb translated "shall be left alive" (*yatar*) in 13:8, and this connects the ideas.

<span id="page-723-7"></span>"feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives," and it "shall be split in two from east to west." The Mount of Olives, to the east of Jerusalem, is a ridge about 2.5 miles (4 km) long that runs in a north/south direction. Significantly, when the glory of the Lord departed from the temple and Jerusalem in Ezekiel's vision, the glory "stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city" (Ezek. 11:23). Here Zechariah envisages the Lord's return by way of the same path (cf. Ezek. 43:2). It is also significant that Zechariah describes the location of the mountain as "on the east," since the earlier sanctuaries of Eden, the tabernacle, and the temple were all entered from the east. The city of Jerusalem is envisaged as God's sanctuary.

<span id="page-723-8"></span>God's arrival will split the Mount of Olives in two: "One half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward." This results in the formation of a "very wide valley" through which God's people will flee. The verb "split" (*baqaʻ*) is used to describe the parting of the waters of the Red Sea in Exodus 14:21, suggesting the escape from Jerusalem in Zechariah 14:5 is like another exodus-salvation.

<span id="page-723-12"></span><span id="page-723-2"></span>14:5 The valley that is formed will become an escape route that extends to Azal, the location of which is unknown, though it must lie to the east of Jerusalem. The future escape is likened to when the people "fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah," an event that occurred more than two hundred years earlier and clearly left a lasting impression (Amos 1:1).

<span id="page-723-10"></span><span id="page-723-9"></span>After providing salvation for the people, the Lord will return to Jerusalem. The description "my God" underscores Zechariah's personal relationship with the Lord. He will return to Jerusalem with "all the holy ones," yet it is not certain who these "holy ones" are. They could be the heavenly host of angels (e.g., Zech. 6:1–8; Deut. 33:2; Ps. 89:5, 7; Dan. 8:13) or the people who, having endured the attack on Jerusalem, are now refined, cleansed, and saved and now return to inhabit Jerusalem as "holy" (e.g., Lev. 21:7–8; Num. 16:5, 7; 2 Chron. 35:3).

<span id="page-723-5"></span><span id="page-723-4"></span><span id="page-723-3"></span>14:6–7 The Hebrew of verse 6 is difficult to translate, and the ESV follows the ancient versions: "There shall be no light, cold, or frost." An alternative translation is, "Splendid ones shall congeal," where "splendid ones" refers to the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, and stars) that become stationary on a "unique day" (v. 7).52 This may draw on the account of the Lord fighting for his people at Gibeon, when the sun stood still and the moon stopped (Josh. 10:12–14). In any case, God's return to Jerusalem will disrupt the present created order. Indeed, the language of these verses echoes the Genesis creation account (cf. Zech. 12:1). Zechariah envisages a new creation, with "neither day nor night" but instead a single day of "light." When evening comes, "there shall be light" instead of darkness (14:7; cf. Isa. 60:19–20; Rev. 21:25; 22:5).

<span id="page-723-14"></span><span id="page-723-13"></span><span id="page-723-11"></span><span id="page-723-6"></span><span id="page-723-1"></span>14:8 In the same way that life-giving water flowed from Eden (Gen. 2:10), the coming day will bring a new supply of "living waters" to the world, flowing from

<span id="page-723-0"></span><sup>52</sup> The expression "unique day" can also be translated "one day" (cf. ESV mg.), echoing the Genesis creation account (Gen. 1:5).

<span id="page-724-10"></span><span id="page-724-4"></span>Jerusalem (cf. Ps. 36:8–9; Ezek. 47:1–12; Joel 3:18).53 The phrase "living waters" connotes waters that are fresh (not stagnant or contaminated) and give life. The picture of the waters' dividing into two and flowing "to the eastern sea" (the Dead Sea) and the "western sea" (the Mediterranean) indicates a great volume of water (double that of Ezekiel's vision in 47:8–12, which flows only to the Dead Sea). Since Jerusalem's water supply often dried up in summer and it was common practice to cut off a city's water supply during a siege (cf. Isa. 7:3; 22:11), the statement that it "shall continue in summer as in winter" also speaks of a great supply of water and pictures the Lord's blessing.

<span id="page-724-15"></span><span id="page-724-6"></span>14:9 The statement that the Lord "will be king over all the earth" forms the climax of Zechariah's vision of the future—God's kingship is basic to the establishment of his kingdom. His salvation of Jerusalem will prove his reign and bring to fulfillment earlier hopes expressed in the book.

<span id="page-724-13"></span><span id="page-724-0"></span>The expression "The Lord will be one" is a citation of the Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4—"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"—as an expression of God's uniqueness; he is the only one who is truly God. In addition, since the names of the idols will be banished (cf. Zech. 13:2), God's "name" will be the "only name," a further expression of his uniqueness, implying that "on that day" he will be the only one worshiped in all the earth.

<span id="page-724-16"></span><span id="page-724-12"></span>14:10 The earth will be transformed and Jerusalem will be elevated from its surrounding territory. The cities of Geba and Rimmon represent, respectively, the northern and southern boundaries of the land of Judah. Following the ESV, the land will be flattened and "Jerusalem shall remain aloft."54 The phrase "on its site" is also found in 12:6, where it is translated "in its place"; in both instances it seems to mean Jerusalem shall be restored to "its rightful place." This is in keeping with the hopes of the earlier prophets for Jerusalem (e.g., Isa. 2:1–4; Ezek. 40:1–2; Mic. 4:1–5).

<span id="page-724-9"></span><span id="page-724-8"></span><span id="page-724-5"></span>Several landmarks of the preexilic city are identified, but it is not possible to determine with confidence the precise location of them all.55 The "Gate of Benjamin" was located on the northern side of the city to give access to the territory of Benjamin (cf. Jer. 37:13; 38:7). The "former gate" is not otherwise mentioned in the OT but may refer to the main gate on the east side of the city. The "Corner Gate" is thought to be on the west side of the city (cf. 2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chron. 26:9; Jer. 31:38). The location of the "Tower of Hananel" is unknown but may be west of the Benjamin Gate at the northwestern corner of the Temple Mount (cf. Neh. 3:1; 12:39; Jer. 31:38). Finally, the "king's winepresses" are not mentioned elsewhere

<span id="page-724-14"></span><span id="page-724-7"></span><span id="page-724-3"></span><span id="page-724-2"></span><span id="page-724-1"></span><sup>53</sup> A significant difference is that in other OT passages water flows from the temple/sanctuary, whereas here in Zechariah it flows from Jerusalem. This suggests Jerusalem takes the role of the temple (cf. vv. 4, 20–21).

<sup>54</sup> The clause "The whole land shall be turned into a plain" can also be translated "He will surround all the land like the Arabah," the dry rift that forms the Jordan River Valley, surrounded by steep escarpments. This phrase could be saying that just as the Arabah is surrounded, so God will surround the whole land to protect it (cf. 2:4–5).

<span id="page-724-11"></span><sup>55</sup> The following suggestions are made by Marvin A. Sweeney, *Twelve Prophets*, vol. 2: Berit Olam: Studies in Hebrew Narrative and Poetry (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2000), 702–703.

<span id="page-725-7"></span><span id="page-725-4"></span>but may be on the south of the city near the "King's Pool" and the "king's garden" (cf. Neh. 2:14; 3:15). The prophet Jeremiah also envisions Jerusalem being rebuilt "from the tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate" (Jer. 31:38). Like Zechariah, the future city of Jerusalem is said to be "sacred" or "holy to the Lord" (Jer. 31:40; cf. Zech. 14:20).

<span id="page-725-21"></span><span id="page-725-16"></span><span id="page-725-15"></span><span id="page-725-10"></span><span id="page-725-8"></span><span id="page-725-1"></span>14:11 Those who had fled the city in verse 5 shall return to dwell in it—"It shall be inhabited" (cf. 1:17; 2:4). Never again will there be a "decree of utter destruction" (Hb. *herem*, cf. ESV mg., "refers to things devoted [or set apart] to the Lord [or by the Lord] for destruction"). In Deuteronomy, *herem* is associated with the removal of the Canaanites from the Promised Land to cleanse it from the contamination associated with their idolatry (cf. Deut. 7:25–26; 20:17–18). This implies that God's action against Jerusalem in Zechariah 14:1–2 is to cleanse it from the contamination of sin. Having been cleansed, it will be inhabited by the "holy ones" (v. 5) and "shall dwell in security," implying military protection or agricultural abundance (cf. 2:5; 3:9–10; Ps. 46:5).

<span id="page-725-18"></span><span id="page-725-14"></span><span id="page-725-13"></span><span id="page-725-5"></span>14:12–13 Further details are given about how God will fight against the nations who have come to "wage war against Jerusalem" (cf. 12:4–6; 14:3). First, he will strike them with "plague" so that their "flesh . . . eyes . . . and their tongues will rot." To some extent, this recalls the plagues God sent on the Egyptians in the exodus to liberate his people (Exodus 7–12). Here the plague incapacitates the warriors, removing their ability to see and to speak. This presumably contributes to the "great panic . . . [that] shall fall on them," which is also attributed to the Lord and expresses his sovereignty in judgment. The panic results in the nations fighting' one another ("The hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other" refers to military activity; cf. Ezek. 38:21). Earlier in Israel's history, God struck their enemies with fear so that they fought one another (e.g., Judg. 7:22; 1 Sam. 14:15–20).

<span id="page-725-19"></span><span id="page-725-12"></span><span id="page-725-9"></span><span id="page-725-3"></span><span id="page-725-2"></span>14:14 The statement "even Judah will fight at Jerusalem" is ambiguous, since the preposition "at" can also be translated "against" (cf. ESV mg.). This verse should be read against the background of 12:2–6 (cf. comments on 12:2; 12:5–6). While Judah is initially caught up with the nations gathering against Jerusalem, she sees God at work and turns to fight for Jerusalem against the nations (12:5–6).

<span id="page-725-0"></span>Just as Israel plundered the Egyptians in the exodus (Ex. 12:35–36), so God's defeat of the nations will result in their wealth being collected—"gold, silver, and garments in great abundance." This reverses the situation described in Zechariah 14:1 (cf. similarly Isa. 60:4–14; Ezek. 38:12–13; 39:10; Hag. 2:6–9).

<span id="page-725-20"></span><span id="page-725-17"></span><span id="page-725-11"></span><span id="page-725-6"></span>14:15 In addition to the plague on the peoples (v. 12), a destroying "plague" will strike the animals used in war. The "horse" was used in combat, either mounted or with chariots containing archers. Much damage was done by trampling enemy troops (cf. comments on 10:3; 10:4–5). The next three animals ("mules . . . camels . . . donkeys") were used for transporting supplies. The other "beasts" (alternatively <span id="page-726-6"></span>"cattle") probably refer to livestock used as a food resource (e.g., 2 Kings 3:9). Reference to the "camps" indicates they were animals used by an army.

<span id="page-726-11"></span>14:16 Verses 16–19 address the aftermath of the battle and the two different outcomes for "everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem." The first outcome is that of survivors who recognize God as king (cf. v. 9) and go "year after year" (annually) to worship the Lord of hosts and keep the "Feast of Booths" (or "Tabernacles" or *Sukkoth*). This was a seven-day festival held in the seventh month, characterized by joy and thanksgiving for the harvest and God's goodness. The "booths," or tabernacles, reminded the people of the tents the Israelites lived in when they came out of Egypt (cf. Lev. 23:33–43). The festival is elsewhere associated with the temple and includes the foreigner's sharing in the blessings of God (Deut. 16:13–15; 1 Kings 8:2, 41–43, 65; Ezra 3:1–4). Including "all the nations" in worship mirrors the end of Zechariah 8 (cf. comment on 8:23).

<span id="page-726-15"></span><span id="page-726-13"></span><span id="page-726-12"></span><span id="page-726-9"></span><span id="page-726-7"></span><span id="page-726-5"></span><span id="page-726-4"></span><span id="page-726-2"></span>14:17–19 The outcome for those who do not "worship the King" (v. 16) will be "no rain" (vv. 17–18) and the "plague" (v. 18) as "punishment" (v. 19; cf. vv. 12–15).56 Lack of rain would devastate the harvest and is a classic covenant curse (e.g., Deut. 28:22–24). The "family of Egypt" (Zech. 14:18) are singled out, possibly because they were not so directly dependent on rain because of the Nile, which flooded annually. Alternatively, they may be singled out to indicate that this salvation will be a new exodus, with Egypt representing the enemy who must recognize God's kingship or suffer his punishment.

<span id="page-726-17"></span><span id="page-726-16"></span><span id="page-726-8"></span><span id="page-726-1"></span>14:20–21 The book of Zechariah ends with a picture of holiness spreading from God's presence among his people (cf. v. 5; 2:12–13). The turban of the high priest had an inscription "Holy to the Lord" engraved on a gold plate (Ex. 28:36–38). This same holiness will extend to the "bells of the horses" (Zech. 14:20). These bells attached to the harness and had a number of functions: to ward off insects; to govern cadence; to create white noise to block out the heinous sounds of battle; to alert others to their arrival on a roadway; and, if inscribed, to identify its owner so the horse could be returned.57 Given the consistent association of the horse with war throughout the book, the bells were probably considered unclean, and this statement about their holiness perhaps speaks of the end of war (cf. 9:10). Zechariah mentions horses ten times throughout the book, beginning with the first night vision, so this is a fitting note on which to end.

<span id="page-726-18"></span><span id="page-726-10"></span><span id="page-726-3"></span><span id="page-726-0"></span>Similarly, the holiness associated with the "bowls before the altar" (cf. Ex. 27:3; Num. 4:14) will spread to the "pots in the house of the Lord" (the temple) and to "every pot in Jerusalem and Judah" (Zech. 14:21). These pots were used for sacrifice, presumably by those who came to participate in the Feast of Booths (vv. 16–19).

<span id="page-726-14"></span><sup>56</sup> The phrase "families of the earth" can also be translated "clans of the land" and may refer to Jews living in the Promised Land, who must also worship the Lord.

<sup>57</sup> Cantrell, *Horsemen of Israel*, 21–22.

<span id="page-727-2"></span><span id="page-727-0"></span>The word "trader" can have two senses. The sixth vision of the flying basket (5:5–11) indicated trade was an area in which wickedness and idolatry impacted the postexilic community, thus the removal of the "trader" indicates the community will be cleansed (cf. 13:2–6). Alternatively, the word "trader" can also be translated "Canaanite" (cf. ESV mg.). The Canaanites were renowned for their idolatry, and this promises its removal. In either case, this prophecy looks forward to the time when God will return and everything impure will be removed from the temple and the land.

#### *Response*

This chapter looks toward God's coming kingdom and reveals that it will not come without cost to God's people. Yet when the nations come against Jerusalem, the Lord will come dramatically as a warrior and fight for his people to save them. He will establish his kingship in Jerusalem and will be worshiped by those of his people and the nations who survive.

<span id="page-727-16"></span><span id="page-727-12"></span><span id="page-727-10"></span><span id="page-727-8"></span><span id="page-727-7"></span><span id="page-727-5"></span><span id="page-727-4"></span>The NT connects many of the images in this chapter with Jesus. He is the one who as king has established God's kingdom (e.g., Matt. 4:17; Mark 1:15; Luke 4:43). According to Matthew 27:51–54, when Jesus died on the cross, "The earth shook, and the rocks were split" in an "earthquake," and "many bodies of the saints [holy people] . . . were raised . . . [and] went into the holy city" (Jerusalem). Matthew connects these apocalyptic signs with the salvation that came in Jesus' death. In addition, Jesus is the "light of the world" (Zech. 14:7; John 8:12; 9:5) and the one from whom "living water" comes (Zech. 14:8; John 4:10–15; cf. Rev. 21:6; 22:17; a feature also of the new Jerusalem in Rev. 22:1–2). In John's Gospel, his work is connected with the Feast of Booths, which he fulfills (John 7:1–8:59; Col. 2:16–17). He also drove the traders out of the temple in keeping with Zechariah 14:21 (e.g., Matt. 21:12; John 2:16). While Jesus established God's kingdom in his first coming, its full reality will be experienced at his return, when he hands the kingdom to his Father (1 Cor. 15:23–28). In John's vision of the new Jerusalem, there is no temple (Rev. 21:22), for all that the temple symbolized (God's presence and rule) will be realized in the city. This seems to be anticipated in Zechariah 14, where God's holiness spreads from items normally associated with the temple to ordinary items in the city. In Revelation 21:2, this "holy city," the "new Jerusalem," is the bride of the Lamb, the church. Christians have been made holy (or "sanctified") through the death of Jesus (Zech. 14:5; 1 Cor. 6:11; Heb. 10:10) and are also called to be holy (e.g., 1 Thess. 4:3; 1 Pet. 1:15–16).

<span id="page-727-15"></span><span id="page-727-14"></span><span id="page-727-13"></span><span id="page-727-11"></span><span id="page-727-9"></span><span id="page-727-6"></span><span id="page-727-3"></span><span id="page-727-1"></span>Zechariah predicts the suffering of the Messiah (cf. Zech. 12:10; 13:7). Just as Jesus suffered, so those who follow him are to expect suffering in this age (Mark 10:30; Acts 14:22; Rom. 8:17; 2 Cor. 4:17). It is part of God's plan to refine and test his people's faith, so that it might prove genuine and result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus returns (1 Pet. 1:6–7). The power God has displayed in battles of the past, climaxing in the defeat of sin, death, and the Devil in Jesus' death and resurrection, is the same power by which God will raise up his people on the last

<span id="page-728-0"></span>day, guaranteeing our inheritance (Eph. 1:17–22). The promises of God's supreme kingship and ultimate victory over all enemies portrayed in this chapter should strengthen faith and hope amid suffering.

<span id="page-728-1"></span>This chapter also reminds God's people of the dual outcome for all, to be revealed when Jesus returns. People will either worship God as king or suffer his punishment forever. This aspect of Zechariah's prophetic vision should drive us to call on all people to recognize the triune God (Father, Son, and Spirit), as the one true King over all the earth: "The Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come.' And let the one who hears say, 'Come.' And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price" (Rev. 22:17).

# MALACHI

*Eric Ortlund*

## <span id="page-731-3"></span>INTRODUCTION TO MALACHI

## *Overview*

<span id="page-731-7"></span><span id="page-731-5"></span>Malachi addressed the covenant community of Israel during a time of great discouragement and disarray following its return from exile in Babylon. Although heirs of the prophetic promises of restoration, God's people lacked any sense of his love (1:2–5). Their worship was impure and dishonoring (1:6–2:9). Spiritual betrayal disrupted the community, especially its marriages (2:10–16). God's people neglected the tithe (3:6–12) and considered God's cause futile (2:17–3:5; 3:13–4:3). Malachi set about repairing the covenant relationship in two ways: by calling the community to renewed obedience to the Mosaic covenant, and by describing the coming "day of the Lord" (4:5; cf. 3:1–5; 4:1–3), when God would bring justice and restoration to his people.

## <span id="page-731-8"></span>*Author*

<span id="page-731-4"></span>We know nothing about Malachi except his name (1:1), which means "my messenger." Some have understood this as a title, but every other OT Prophetic Book begins with the prophet's name, so it is best to assume the same here. The book, which closes the OT prophetic canon, deflects all attention from the prophet toward the disputations between the Lord and his people.

## *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-731-6"></span>We do not know the exact dates of Malachi's ministry. Since the Minor Prophets seem to be arranged in roughly chronological order, we can infer that he ministered after Haggai and Zechariah. The people have returned from exile and the temple has been rebuilt (cf. 1:10; the temple was rebuilt in 516 BC). The reference to a governor in 1:8 shows that the Persians were still in power. Malachi's addressing issues of concern to Ezra and Nehemiah may suggest they were contemporaries (cf. mixed marriages, Mal. 2:10–16 and Ezra 9:1–15; the tithe, Mal. 3:6–12 and Neh. 10:32; 13:10–14). However, it is also possible that these problems were perennial (Nehemiah ends with reforming mixed marriages [13:23–28], even though Ezra had already addressed this issue).

<span id="page-731-2"></span><span id="page-731-1"></span><span id="page-731-0"></span>The contents of Malachi make his motivating concerns easier to discern. Already in Nehemiah, the task of rebuilding the city physically and the people spiritually was daunting (cf. Neh. 1:3; 2:3, 17; 4:2; 5:1–5). Malachi's audience was <span id="page-732-8"></span>cynical: serving God seemed like drudgery, while spiritual rebels enjoyed the blessings God promised to his own (3:14–15). God seemed absent (2:17). Major aspects of proper worship in the old covenant were neglected, as if nothing of importance were at stake. The thought seemed to be, "If God does not care, why should we?"1 Malachi addresses this state of exhausted despair.

## *Genre and Literary Features*

Each of the six major sections of the book unfolds according to the same fourfold pattern: God lays a charge against his people concerning some failure in covenant, to which the people respond by asking how they have failed. The response always begins with "But you say" (which was perhaps not stated verbally—Malachi may be exposing only half-conscious resentment and resistance to God). The third step in this pattern shows God answering his people's question; the fourth closes each section with the Lord applying this answer, with warnings and promises for the future. For example, the first passage of the book begins with an initial statement from God, which is immediately questioned (1:2a). God answers by reaffirming his unmerited love for Israel (v. 2b) and his treatment of Edom according to his hatred of that nation (v. 3). The passage closes by promising the full outworking of this love and hatred in the future (vv. 4–5).

<span id="page-732-6"></span><span id="page-732-4"></span><span id="page-732-3"></span><span id="page-732-2"></span><span id="page-732-1"></span><span id="page-732-0"></span>Malachi does not use this form mechanically. Even in the passage mentioned above, the initial statement beginning verse 2 is not an accusation of negligence but a statement of love. Sometimes the people ask two questions (1:7; 3:7–8), while 2:10–14 shows two charges before the first question. Despite these variations, the form is consistent, because Malachi's purpose in each passage is the same. The initial charge brings to the surface the hidden sense of neglect and unfair treatment the postexilic community nursed toward God. The question-and-answer exchanges give the audience a chance to air their grievances and thus leaves them without argument, open to the surprising claims of the prophet. The final applications of each section inspire new hope by contradicting the audience's certainty. The disputation form is exactly suited to the resistance of Malachi's audience and its need of a new vision for the future.

## *Theology of Malachi*

<span id="page-732-5"></span>Malachi is a capable and practical theologian in his role of repairing the postexilic community's relationship with God according to the Mosaic covenant. For instance, in frequently addressing the priesthood, Malachi addresses them with reference to what they already know (1:8–9, 12–14; 2:5–7). Therefore, although he does not seem to advance our understanding of the priest's role in the OT, he masterfully applies it to his own setting.

<span id="page-732-7"></span>Malachi exhibits a number of significant insights into the character and action of God. As discussed in 2:10–16, Malachi explores God's intentions in, and the

<sup>1</sup> Douglas Stuart, "Malachi," in *The Minor Prophets*, ed. Thomas McComiskey, 3 vols. (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2009), 3:1255.

<span id="page-733-3"></span><span id="page-733-1"></span>deeper significance of, marriage. God's grace as expressed in undeservedly good treatment of his people is a constant theme in the book. Malachi addresses none of the people's failures before first insisting on God's ancient love of his people (1:2). The book's second major section (1:6–2:9) shows that God intends his solemn warnings to establish and maintain the covenant so that the community can engage in the worship that will one day fill the earth (1:14). The day of the Lord passages show God taking the initiative to prepare his people through a messenger for his fiery appearance (3:2; 4:1). If God's people tithe, he will give everything he has in response (3:10). Indeed, even the disputation form itself is a sign of God's persistent pursuit of his people when they had given up on him (2:17; 3:13–15).

<span id="page-733-9"></span><span id="page-733-8"></span><span id="page-733-7"></span><span id="page-733-5"></span><span id="page-733-4"></span>God's action on the day of the Lord is treated in two significant passages focusing on the direct appearance of God to reestablish justice. In 2:17–3:5, the Lord spiritually refines his people by means of a messenger (3:2–4) before coming to establish justice (v. 5). The book's final passage more clearly describes the discriminating effects of God's judgment on that day (4:1–3) to show that whatever injustices his servants now suffer will be made up for abundantly on that day (3:17).

### <span id="page-733-11"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

The Mosaic covenant — especially laws for priests and sacrifices — stands in the immediate background of many passages, but Malachi's engagement with these passages involves mainly their application. At a few points, however, Malachi extends or reapplies earlier texts and themes; for instance, the necessity of pure worship according to Mosaic legislation is set within the context of the worldwide worship of God in 1:8–14. The status of God's people as a "treasured possession" (Ex. 19:5) is reapplied to God-fearers within the Judahite community in Malachi 3:17.

<span id="page-733-10"></span><span id="page-733-2"></span><span id="page-733-0"></span>Malachi is clearly tied to Haggai and Zechariah as a third prophet speaking to God's people after their return from exile. While Haggai and Zechariah prophesy the rebuilding of the temple, however, Malachi addresses how the community must live as it enjoys worship there.

<span id="page-733-13"></span><span id="page-733-12"></span><span id="page-733-6"></span>Malachi suitably closes the OT prophetic corpus with his description of the day of the Lord, specifically Elijah's preparatory role (3:1; 4:5–6) before the Lord himself comes to his people (3:5; 4:2). The Gospels understand John the Baptist to have fulfilled this role of a second Elijah (Matt. 11:14; Mark 9:11; Luke 1:17). In this way, Malachi forms an important bridge between the Testaments and provides a means to appreciate fully the significance of God's coming to his people in the person of his Son.

#### *Preaching from Malachi*

Christian disciples in the new covenant occupy a redemptive-historical situation similar to that of Malachi's audience. Just as the Judahite community was heir to earlier prophetic promises of restoration, yet struggled with poverty and the difficulty of rebuilding their lives after the exile, so Christians often struggle

<span id="page-734-7"></span><span id="page-734-6"></span><span id="page-734-5"></span><span id="page-734-4"></span><span id="page-734-3"></span><span id="page-734-1"></span>with a sense of dissonance between their victory through Christ and the present reality of their lives. A sense of being unloved by God can set in (Mal. 1:2–4). Worship becomes a burden and we excuse laxness in it, forgetting God's greater purpose to fill the earth with his praise (1:6–14); giving is neglected, forgetting God's promise to bless generously (3:6–12). Pastors can (unintentionally or not) hinder and harm those under their charge (cf. v. 8 in 2:1–9). Unfaithfulness in marriage and frivolous divorce may be tolerated as a compensation for the difficulties of serving God (2:10–16). Finally, jealousy of those defying God might spark complaints of unfair treatment (2:17–3:5; 3:13–4:3). Malachi addresses each of these situations by reminding the people of what they already know (as taught by Moses) and looking forward to the day of the Lord. Christian pastors can apply Malachi's words to their own congregations by reminding them of what they already know of Jesus, who fulfills the pattern of priestly ministry and teaching established by Moses, and by directing their gaze forward, as we, "on whom the end of the ages has come" (1 Cor. 10:11), await the full flowering of God's action for us on that day.

## <span id="page-734-8"></span>*Interpretive Challenges*

Malachi does not present many interpretive challenges. Even the passages describing the day of the Lord, although naturally leaving many questions unanswered, are still clear with regard to what God will do "on the day when I act" (4:3) and what God's people can hope for.

<span id="page-734-2"></span><span id="page-734-0"></span>One ambiguity involves the relationship between priests and Levites in the book and in the postexilic period generally: although the Pentateuch separates Levitical duties from those of the priests (Numbers 3–4), Malachi speaks of them interchangeably (cf. 1:6; 2:1, 4–7). It is probably not helpful, however, to reconstruct the history of the Israelite priesthood on this difference alone. We simply do not know much about the history of the ancient Israelite priesthood.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-736-8"></span><span id="page-736-5"></span><span id="page-736-2"></span><span id="page-736-0"></span>1:1 The first verse of the book does more than give information about its human author. Each word supports the divine origin and authority of the entire message. The word translated "oracle" frequently heads prophetic passages (e.g., Isa. 13:1; 15:1; 17:1) and means literally "burden" (Num. 4:47; 11:11), conveying a sense of urgency. This burden is further defined as a word from the Lord (cf. 2 Pet. 1:21) spoken by a human messenger. This word is the powerful proclamation of the King, effective in history to shape all events according to his will (Isa. 55:11; Jer. 1:9–10; 23:29). This word is addressed to Israel, even though in Malachi's day only the Judahite community remained. The postexilic community is heir to all God's promises to Israel.

<span id="page-736-7"></span><span id="page-736-4"></span><span id="page-736-3"></span><span id="page-736-1"></span>1:2a The first word God speaks through Malachi does not expose Israel's sin (unlike Isa. 1:2–3; Jer. 2:1–3; Ezek. 2:3–4) but rather declares his love (*'hb*) for <span id="page-737-9"></span><span id="page-737-5"></span><span id="page-737-1"></span>them. This word expresses both deep affection and loyalty in all types of human relationship (marriage, Gen. 24:67; parents and children, Gen. 25:28; close friends, 1 Sam. 20:17). It also recalls the Lord's ancient promises of love for Israel in the Pentateuch; God loved the earliest generations of Israelites and chose them (Deut. 4:37; 10:15), showing his love by blessing and multiplying them (Deut. 7:13). This love is sovereign and unconditional, existing for no reason beyond God's loving, faithful character. The perfect form of the verb expresses God's love as a total, complete act. God begins this book of disputations by declaring his unchanging and enduring love for his people.

<span id="page-737-14"></span><span id="page-737-0"></span>1:2b The word translated "how" sometimes refers to the external evidence that some action has happened or will have happened (Gen. 15:8; Ex. 33:16). Malachi's audience sees no visible evidence of the Lord's love for them. They feel entirely unloved—and, as we will see, this feeling was not totally without justification. But Malachi exposes their darkest suspicions about God in order to subvert those doubts.

<span id="page-737-15"></span><span id="page-737-4"></span><span id="page-737-3"></span><span id="page-737-2"></span>1:2c–3 Malachi challenges the people's claim of being unloved by returning them to the beginning of their history. Although the story of Jacob and Esau is complex (Genesis 25–36), and Esau appears spiritually insensitive on a number of occasions (25:29–34; 26:34–35; 28:6–9), Genesis shows that God's favor rested on Jacob before either boy was even born (25:23; cf. Rom. 9:10–13). Although their initial condition was the same, although the parties in question were equal (brothers), the Lord set his love on Jacob, not Esau, for no reason intrinsic to themselves. Because this love was unmerited, it is unchanging. From before their ancestor's birth, God has loved Israel. The imperfect form of the verb ending Malachi 1:2 implies God's ongoing love for Jacob, while the perfect verb beginning verse 3 shows his settled and unchanging opposition to Esau.

<span id="page-737-16"></span><span id="page-737-13"></span><span id="page-737-12"></span><span id="page-737-11"></span><span id="page-737-8"></span><span id="page-737-6"></span>Just as God's love implies both affection and loyalty, so hatred in the OT implies loathing and disgust (Ps. 119:163; Eccles. 2:18) as well as rejection and opposition (Ps. 26:5; Isa. 66:5; a wife less loved is "hated," Deut. 21:15). Israel may see no evidence of the Lord's love for her, but there was already abundant evidence of his hatred of Edom, as God made its hill country desolate. In the OT, mountains are often a symbol of fertility (Deut. 33:15; Pss. 50:10; 72:3) and strength and stability (Ps. 46:2; Isa. 54:10), yet this most solid and impressive aspect of Edom was withered, so that nothing could grow. In addition, Edom is disinherited; its inheritance (cf. Deut. 32:8–9) is given over to scavengers. The imagery of unclean animals living in a once-inhabited city or land is found elsewhere as an outcome of God's judgment (Ps. 44:19; Isa. 13:22; 34:13; Jer. 9:11; 10:22; 49:33). This image would have had sinister connotations for ancient Israelites, as if Edom had been given over to a dark spiritual power.

<span id="page-737-10"></span><span id="page-737-7"></span>It may seem strange or even offensive for God to prove his love for one nation by widespread destruction of another nation. But the Babylonian captivity was so traumatic and horrific a violation of God's people that Edom's joy at Israel's <span id="page-738-6"></span><span id="page-738-5"></span>destruction (Ps. 137:7) and its exploitation of Israel's vulnerability for its own gain (Ezek. 35:15; Obad. 10) echo across the pages of the OT prophets as profoundly perverse. (It is roughly equivalent to celebrating the rape of a family member.) God's judgment of Edom would not have been perceived as excessive.

<span id="page-738-7"></span>1:4 In seeking to convince his people of his abiding love for them, the Lord stifles a potential objection. While the Judahite economy was depressed in Malachi's day, Edom's fortunes looked to be on the rise ("we will rebuild")—it expected to recover as a nation. The Lord does not regard their capacity to rebuild as wishful thinking, but instead works out his hatred for Edom by destroying whatever progress they make. That Edom will be called "the wicked country" means that God will seal them in their sin in so public and obvious a way that no one will wonder why God judged this people.

<span id="page-738-0"></span>Edom's spiritual fate is described in two phrases: "wicked country" (lit., "wicked border") and "the people with whom the Lord is angry forever." These two phrases describe both territory and people, cause and effect in God's eternal judgment. The word for anger is parallel with "curse" in Numbers 23:7 and with God's "burning anger" in Psalm 69:24 and Zechariah 1:12. Edom forever lies under God's just and passionate anger because of its sin.

<span id="page-738-8"></span><span id="page-738-2"></span>1:5 The final verse of the passage concludes the description of God working out his hatred of Edom by turning to the way in which he works out his love for Israel. One might have expected God to assure Israel that it (in contrast to Edom) would be built up and would prosper, or that it would never be taken advantage of again. Instead, God's people are caught up in God's self-exaltation beyond their own borders.

<span id="page-738-3"></span>This short verse is deceptively simple and highly significant. That Israel will "see" reverses their earlier skepticism about God's love, when they claimed to have seen no evidence of that love (v. 2b). Now they will speak otherwise, visibly convinced. But their speech entirely concerns God and his glory, not themselves. God's greatness often is seen in his intervention on Israel's behalf (Pss. 92:5; 126:2–3) or on behalf of individuals within Israel (Pss. 35:17; 40:17; 86:11). To speak of God's greatness is to imply his glory (cf. Isa. 42:21) and exaltation (Ps. 99:2). In this brief phrase Malachi captures Israel's future astonishment at the Lord's visible glory as he works out justice in the earth.

<span id="page-738-4"></span><span id="page-738-1"></span>The worldwide implications of this exaltation should not be missed—God's greatness will be known "beyond" (lit. "above") the borders of Israel. The Lord's greatness is centered within the borders of his covenant people but is not limited to there. This is how God executes his love for his deeply discouraged and wronged people—he works out justice in the earth, to his great glory.

### *Response*

The Lord's confrontation of his people in the book of Malachi is difficult and unflinching. But before he exposes and challenges his people's many failures <span id="page-739-3"></span><span id="page-739-0"></span>before the law, he "confronts" them with the gospel of his love.2 It is possible to be unaware of being loved deeply by God. In Malachi's day, as Edom looked forward to improved national fortunes, it would have appeared as if it was getting away with ugly joy over its ancient relative's tragedy, even profiting at Judah's expense (Ps. 137:7; Ezek. 35:13; Obad. 10–14; this may partially be the background of the people's questions in Mal. 2:17 and 3:14–15), redoubling Judah's pain. God's judgment of Edom shows how seriously he takes the wrong done to his people and his commitment to justice for their sake. God's love will be seen, in part, in the eternal memorial he establishes to the wrong Edom has done to Judah ("they will be called 'the wicked country'"; 1:4). The final antidote to Judah's skepticism, however, will be a kind of self-forgetfulness as they are caught up in worship of a God who through his love and judgment demonstrates his greatness in all the world.

<span id="page-739-1"></span>In the same way, it is possible for an individual, a church, or God's people in a particular place and time to be convinced that they are unloved by God, and as a result to dishonor him through lax worship. This is especially likely to happen when God's people have suffered and God apparently does nothing about it. Malachi's words echo beyond their original context to assure us that, very soon, God's love and commitment to us will be visibly evident in a context as wide as creation. It is especially urgent for us new covenant believers to hear this assurance of God's love and of his commitment to exalt himself by working out justice, since we live in the shadow of the cross, where God displayed his perfect love and justice, pouring out on his son the wrath we deserved (v. 4). At the same time, this initial promise of the full outworking of God's love gives Malachi's warnings a weight they might not otherwise have. We, who have benefited and will benefit from God's determination to exalt himself in the earth, dare not refuse the one who is speaking to us (Heb. 12:25).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-741-14"></span><span id="page-741-2"></span><span id="page-741-1"></span>1:6 Malachi argues from the lesser to the greater, beginning with what his audience would find indisputable. The honoring of fathers was written into Israel's covenant with the Lord (Ex. 20:12), and other passages suggest that to dishonor authority figures was seen as especially troubling and ugly (Ex. 21:17; 22:28). But if it is true that fathers and masters are to be honored, why is the greatest and truest Father and Master despised?

<span id="page-741-8"></span>In Malachi's context, these terms are not mere metaphors; father/son and master/servant language predominates in covenantal relationships (cf. 2 Sam. 7:14; 2 Kings 16:7). Other references to God's fatherhood and lordship within the context of his covenant relationship show how shocking this charge is.

<span id="page-741-12"></span><span id="page-741-11"></span><span id="page-741-7"></span><span id="page-741-6"></span><span id="page-741-0"></span>As Father, God is Israel's Creator (Deut. 32:6), who honors her by choosing her from all others for his own possession (vv. 8–9) and by caring for her superbly (vv. 10–14). Isaiah echoes this identification of God as Father and Creator (64:8), tying it to the role of Redeemer (63:16), who fights on Israel's behalf to liberate them from slavery and death and lead them into his *shalom* (Ex. 6:6; 15:13; repeatedly in Isaiah 40–55). This is the same Father who gently receives his penitent firstborn son (Jer. 31:9). Although references to God as Father are uncommon in the OT, the term is redolent of God's loving and abundant care for his people.

<span id="page-741-13"></span><span id="page-741-10"></span><span id="page-741-5"></span><span id="page-741-4"></span>In the OT, Yahweh is called Lord (*'adon*) much more frequently than Father. Two especially noteworthy instances are Deuteronomy 10:17 and Joshua 3:11–13. The first involves the privilege of Israel's election amid Yahweh's lordship over all creation (Deut. 10:14–15), calling for the deepest devotion on Israel's part (v. 16). It is not too much to call for the deep spiritual transformation captured in the metaphor of circumcision of the heart, because the object of that devotion is the Lord, "God of gods and Lord of lords" (v. 17). Joshua 3:11–13 speaks similarly of the ark of the covenant belonging to the "Lord of all the earth." The Lord's relation to Israel is maintained without being limited to his people.

<span id="page-741-9"></span><span id="page-741-3"></span>Since God is Father and Lord in his covenant with his people, it is appropriate that Israel fear and honor him. Fearing God is part of Israel's obeying, serving, and loving its covenant Lord (Deut. 10:12–13). Honoring God occurs amid exuberant worship (Pss. 22:23; 50:14; 86:9, 12). The Lord's confrontation of his people is far from an insecure, strutting tyrant demanding compliments from his officers.

<span id="page-742-11"></span><span id="page-742-4"></span>Nevertheless, the Lord's priests are treating him worse than they would a human authority. Although the people as a whole are guilty (cf. Mal. 1:14), the Lord singles out those who should be leading the congregation in honoring their Lord (cf. Lev. 10:3, where "those who are near" are priests protecting the sanctity of God's holiness so that his glory is not tarnished before the people). The priests are actually despising him—a strong word for the worst kind of scorn (in Num. 15:31, the person who despises God's word is to be cut off from Israel; note also how David is despised as a "worm" in Ps. 22:6). As the protectors of God's holy presence in his temple, the priests have regarded God and his presence as worthless and contemptible.

<span id="page-742-9"></span><span id="page-742-7"></span><span id="page-742-5"></span>1:7 The priests' question, "How does a defiled sacrifice defile you?" shows they have not understood the full significance of the table at which they minister and the presence before whom they stand. In the OT, the temple is God's own dwelling place, standing as a holy center amid a world corrupted by uncleanness, sin, and death. The temple is where Israel enjoys direct access to God's life-giving holiness. The altar plays an especially important role in God's gracious purposes for the temple as the place where sin is purged and atoned for (Lev. 1:4–10). The altar is Israel's escape—*from* its natural condition of deadly uncleanness *to* its participation in the Lord's holiness and in being set apart for his purposes.

<span id="page-742-3"></span><span id="page-742-2"></span>By bringing animals unfit for sacrifice (cf. Lev. 1:3; 22:22), the priests contradict and destroy the altar's atoning and sanctifying purposes. This mars God's holy presence in his temple and lessens the stature and fame found in forgiving and redeeming his people. Such worship treats as contemptible and worthless the name God made to dwell in his temple.

<span id="page-742-6"></span><span id="page-742-0"></span>The priest's despising of God's name may not have been fully conscious. Malachi's reference to the priests' "saying" the Lord's table may be despised could also be translated as "thinking" (this verb is used similarly in Gen. 17:17; 27:41; 1 Sam. 27:1; Ps. 10:6; Isa. 47:10). While it is possible the priests were broadcasting contempt for the altar, their questions make it more likely the Lord is exposing a half-conscious attitude of contempt toward their calling. Apparently Israel's sense of being unloved (Mal. 1:2) and abandoned by God (2:17) made them feel no great urgency to guard the integrity of their worship.

<span id="page-742-10"></span><span id="page-742-8"></span><span id="page-742-1"></span>Calling the altar a "table" and the animal sacrifices "bread" (ESV "food") is probably meant in part to mirror the meal offered political authorities in 1:8. It may also evoke the meals eaten to seal a covenant (e.g., Ex. 24:1–11). As with the language of "son" and "slave" in Malachi 1:6, the Mosaic covenant is present in the background and gives traction to the prophet's challenge.

1:8 Malachi now appeals to his audience's basic sense of right and wrong. Is it not obvious that blind, sick, or lame animals are insulting gifts? Not even a human authority would accept them. Malachi's question is not merely rhetorical; carved reliefs on the palace of Darius I show processions of servants bringing food and livestock to the king.

<span id="page-743-6"></span><span id="page-743-4"></span>1:9 Unlike in English, imperatives in Hebrew distinguish between individuals and groups being commanded. The command in this verse is plural, and since this passage focuses on priests, they are likely being told to intercede on the people's behalf (cf. Samuel's role in 1 Sam. 13:8–13). Strikingly, Malachi asks for intercession for "us." The prophet identifies himself with those who stand to benefit or suffer from the priests' ministry.

On its own, this command could be taken to show the great need for God's mercy amid his people's failure. The question that concludes the verse, however, shows that Malachi's command is sarcastic: when these kinds of gifts are offered, pleas for mercy will be ignored by God. Malachi implies that the sacrifices accompanying these intercessions are invalid as well. God will not meet with them until their worship is reformed.

<span id="page-743-3"></span><span id="page-743-2"></span><span id="page-743-1"></span>Even more sobering is Malachi's inversion of the Aaronic blessing (Num. 6:24–26) in this verse and elsewhere in this passage: (1) blessing from Numbers 6:24 turns to curse in Malachi 2:2; (2) the phrase "show favor" in 1:9 is literally "lift the face," echoing the Lord's uplifted face in blessing in Numbers 6:26; (3) the same term for the shining of God's face (Num. 6:25) is used for the cessation of kindling fire on the altar in Malachi 1:10.3 In these allusions, Malachi is implying that the ancient blessing that priests were privileged to pronounce has been voided by their despising of God's name. For an Israelite priest, the loss would have been severe.

<span id="page-743-7"></span><span id="page-743-5"></span>1:10 Malachi further probes the consequences of the priests' failure to honor God in their ministry. His desire in this verse would have been painful and shocking to his original audience, but it follows naturally from verses 7–9: not only is the priest's ministry useless, but the entire sacrificial system, which God commanded, might as well be shut down. Malachi leaves his audience no room for evasion, no hope that their present worship might somehow continue. The God they are to honor with their worship would rather the sanctuary doors be shut, the building unlit by any sacrificial fire, quiet and empty, in order to stop the insulting offerings.

<span id="page-743-0"></span>The Lord's rejection is total; he has no delight in the priests and will accept no offering from them. The term "accept" often signals the conditions by which an offering is pleasing to the Lord (e.g., Lev. 1:4; 7:18; 19:7), but these conditions are now absent. As worship is currently being practiced, no sacrifice is acceptable.

<span id="page-743-10"></span><span id="page-743-9"></span><span id="page-743-8"></span>1:11 The unintended consequences of the priests' careless worship are sobering and serious, but God will lay out terms of repentance in 2:1–9 by which worship can continue. Before laying out these terms, however, and before turning to the guilt of the people as a whole in 1:12–14, the Lord sets the priest's failure in the largest context possible—a context both jarring and hopeful. God reveals in this verse his determination to win the whole world for his worship, and he shows how the priests' unworthy worship impedes his ultimate purpose for all creation.

<sup>3</sup> Michael Fishbane, *Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel* (New York: Clarendon, 1985), 333.

<span id="page-744-19"></span>But he also hints, in connection with the terms of reformation in 2:1–9, that the priests can be included in this ever-expanding praise as God claims the nations for his worship.

<span id="page-744-7"></span><span id="page-744-4"></span><span id="page-744-0"></span>The "rising of the sun to its setting" includes all the earth (cf. Ps. 113:3) no corner of creation will be left silent. The reference to God's great name echoes the priests' despising of his name in Malachi 1:6 and includes elements of both glory and fear. God's fame and stature will be great and glorious among all the nations, and they will respond with worship superior to that of God's own priests. The "incense" and "clean offering" recall directives from the Pentateuch for pleasing worship (cf. Ex. 30:1 for incense and Leviticus 2 for the grain offering, which Malachi references here) and represent the conversion of the nations to the Lord's cause and their entering into covenant with him. The prophets portray the conversion of the nations as a final stage in the Lord's redemption of all things (Isa. 2:1–5; 66:18–24; Amos 9:11–12; Zech. 14:16–21). The priests are presently opposing this glorious vision, but God will allow them to join in as well.

<span id="page-744-15"></span><span id="page-744-14"></span><span id="page-744-11"></span><span id="page-744-10"></span><span id="page-744-9"></span><span id="page-744-8"></span><span id="page-744-6"></span><span id="page-744-5"></span>1:12–14 Malachi reapplies his charge of insulting and unworthy worship (vv. 12– 13), includes the people at large in this charge (v. 14a), and again looks to the final glorious goal of worship (v. 14b). The connection between the present dishonor of God's name and its future glory is made explicit at the beginning of verse 12, as Malachi simply speaks of "it," the name that will one day be great. Malachi fills out the charge against the priests by altering his language: while verse 7 shows the priests despising God's name by despising the Lord's table, they now defile and lessen and "de-glorify" the holiness of God's name ("profane") by regarding the Lord's table as polluted (the same term describing the polluted bread in v. 7). God's worship is, in the priests' eyes, contemptible and dirty, a chore at which they turn up their noses (v. 13). The reduced and impoverished state of the postexilic community may have informed this attitude (Ezra 3:12), but the Lord shows that such an attitude, reflected in unclean sacrifice, reflects badly on the One they are worshiping. Once again the Lord refuses such worship (Mal. 1:13).

<span id="page-744-13"></span><span id="page-744-12"></span><span id="page-744-3"></span><span id="page-744-1"></span>The reference to bringing an offering (v. 13) moves the spotlight to the ordinary worshiper (cf. the same verb in Lev. 2:8). Any Israelite who brings an unworthy offering is warned of the same curse (Mal. 1:14) as the one falling on unrepentant priests (the word is repeated in 2:2).

<span id="page-744-20"></span>Malachi finishes this section by recalling 1:11, adding that God's name will be feared (echoing v. 6) as King.

<span id="page-744-18"></span><span id="page-744-17"></span><span id="page-744-16"></span><span id="page-744-2"></span>2:1–2 Malachi returns to the present and shows the priests how they can align themselves with the future glory of 1:11, 14. The command of 2:1 could refer to covenant stipulations (as in Deut. 28:45; 30:16), following a number of other references to the Mosaic covenant in this passage. However, the exact wording of Malachi 2:1–3 does not refer back clearly to any part of the Mosaic covenant, instead calling on the priests to give glory to God's name, echoing 1:6, 11, 14. Thus this commandment most likely contains the present conditions for repentance:

<span id="page-745-3"></span>honor God's name by reforming worship practices and bringing right sacrifices. (For a construction similar to 2:2, cf. Deut. 28:15.)

<span id="page-745-2"></span>The curse of Malachi 2:2 continues the allusions to Deuteronomy 28, where the Lord lays out judgment for covenant unfaithfulness. Unless these priests attend deeply to Malachi's message, they stand to lose everything in their relationship with God. The plural "blessings" is comprehensive: whatever they enjoy in the Promised Land, redeemed from exile, they can lose. The phrasing is clipped, but this brief reminder of Deuteronomy 28 impresses upon Malachi's audience the gravity with which the Lord lays out these conditions. The verse closes with a surprise: the curses for their covenant failure are already coming into effect but are failing to break the people's stubborn refusal to reform their worship. Such reform will require an explicit warning from the Lord and an explanation of the already active curse.

<span id="page-745-11"></span><span id="page-745-4"></span>2:3 The form of this verse emphasizes the imminence of this curse (the same form is used for the messenger and his preparatory role in 3:1). The "offspring" God rebukes rightly interprets Hebrew "seed" as referring to children (cf. Deut. 28:46, 59). Without a new generation, the postexilic community itself would have disappeared. While the verbs "cut off" or "diminish" would appropriately express God's action here, "rebuke" has connotations of angry opposition (Ps. 9:5; Isa. 54:9; Zech. 3:2). Without reformation, nothing from the Lord but anger lies ahead for the postexilic community.

<span id="page-745-9"></span><span id="page-745-6"></span><span id="page-745-5"></span><span id="page-745-1"></span>The second clause of the verse is deliberately repugnant, especially to priests, as the "dung" (i.e., internal organs) of sacrifices was typically burned outside the camp (Lev. 4:11–12). This implies that the ritual purity the sacrifices provide is being reversed: God will use the priests' sacrifices to make them even dirtier. The last clause of the verse is cryptic: "You shall be taken away with it" (Mal. 2:3) could be translated more literally, "It (or possibly "He") shall bear you to it." It is not entirely clear who or what is being borne away, but as the priests are in view in this verse, the ESV is probably correct in understanding the priests as being carried off. Just as dung is brought outside the camp to be deposited far from God's holy presence, so the unresponsive priests of Malachi's day will be treated like the refuse of their offerings.

<span id="page-745-10"></span><span id="page-745-8"></span><span id="page-745-7"></span><span id="page-745-0"></span>2:4 The particular verb form beginning verse 4 (perfect consecutive) suggests that the inescapable knowledge of "this command" occurs after the judgment of verse 3. Prior to the purpose clause ("that my covenant . . . may stand"), this knowledge appears entirely negative, occurring only after the threatened curse has come into effect (cf. the knowledge of the Egyptians in Ex. 7:5; 14:4). But the end of the verse suggests the opposite: the command to give glory to God in worship intends to maintain God's covenant first made with the priests' great ancestor. In other words, since the entirety of the priesthood is under censure in this passage, the threatened curse of Malachi 2:2–3 would stop temple worship and force the priesthood out of service. But God's larger aim in issuing the command of verse 1 is a happier one.

Malach i 1:6–2:9 746

While the warning is real, God's ultimate intention is to restore the covenant with his priests so that his worship can one day spread throughout the whole world.

<span id="page-746-0"></span>The reference to a covenant with Levi raises some questions, since there is no passage explicitly narrating the making of a covenant with any of Jacob's sons. The most likely candidate is the Lord's covenant with Phineas, a descendant of Levi through Aaron (Num. 25:10–13; the wording in Mal. 2:4–5 is similar to Num. 25:12); other candidates include Jeremiah 33:21 ("my covenant with the Levitical priests") and possibly Deuteronomy 33:9.

<span id="page-746-10"></span><span id="page-746-9"></span><span id="page-746-3"></span><span id="page-746-1"></span>2:5–7 Malachi reminds the priests of God's original intentions and standards in the covenant cited in verse 4. He begins by describing God's aim to communicate life and peace to his priests (v. 5). He then speaks of how a priest ideally should speak and act toward those under his care (v. 6). Verse 7 speaks more generally of the qualities a priest needs.

<span id="page-746-12"></span><span id="page-746-7"></span>The first sentence of verse 5 might more literally be translated, "My covenant was with him—life and peace." Cause and effect are identified for rhetorical effect. God's intention in his covenant with the priests was the fullness of life and blessed peace that only he can give. Joined to these gifts is the awestruck reverence every spiritual leader needs ("fear" recalls 1:6, and "my name" recalls 1:11, 14). In fact, the syntax of the verse implies that even the priest's fear of God is a gift: the ESV appropriately expands Malachi's clipped expression, which literally reads, "And I gave them [i.e., life and peace] to him; fear, and he feared me." Fear is the final covenantal gift from God.

<span id="page-746-11"></span><span id="page-746-8"></span><span id="page-746-4"></span>Malachi then addresses the priest's teaching ministry (cf. Lev. 10:11; Deut. 33:10), his relationship with God, and its blessed consequence of saving many from sin (Mal. 2:6). "True instruction" implies factual correctness (avoiding the errors of 1:8, 13) and reliability as a basis on which those under the priest's charge could guide their lives. This teaching is also morally upright, as the contrast between the first two clauses of the verse shows. Furthermore, a priest should walk with God in integrity and thus enjoy *shalom*, the fullness and richness God intends for his creatures. Such ministry will save many from sin and the corruption and death that inevitably follow. The priests of Malachi's day had fallen far below God's standard.

<span id="page-746-2"></span>In verse 7 Malachi turns to a general affirmation of the role of the priest, its expected response, and the reason for both. In speaking of the priest's "guarding knowledge," Malachi fills out the priest's role. This verb often describes a stubborn attention to the terms of God's covenant (e.g., Deut. 4:2, 6, 9). A priest should jealously attend to the body of knowledge and practice entrusted to them in covenant for the good of God's people. The happy result will be that many will eagerly seek such a priest's instruction, for the priest is the very messenger of God.

<span id="page-746-13"></span><span id="page-746-6"></span><span id="page-746-5"></span>2:8 The priests of Malachi's day had forsaken the Lord's design for the priesthood. The verb "turn away" often signals a serious act of spiritual unfaithfulness (e.g., Jer. 5:23). Two consequences follow: the ministers God has appointed to save many from sin and to help them run in the way of God's commandments (Ps. 119:32)

<span id="page-747-1"></span><span id="page-747-0"></span>are instead causing them to stumble. This stumbling implies that the priests are actively preventing the people under their charge from obeying (the same verb describes unambiguous military defeat in 2 Chron. 25:8 and total moral defeat in Prov. 24:16; Isa. 8:15). Second, the priests are destroying the very means of grace that gave them their ministry: the covenant; the spiritual constitution of God's people. While this was not the priests' intention, it was nevertheless the consequence of their attitude toward God and the temple, reflected in the kind of sacrifices they offered.

<span id="page-747-10"></span><span id="page-747-9"></span><span id="page-747-4"></span>2:9 Although the Lord has already promised the covenant curses (vv. 2–3), the passage concludes with a description of the consequences of and justification for this curse. As the priests treat God as worthless and despised (1:7), so they themselves will be treated; their fate will be proportionate to their sin ("inasmuch as"). This judgment will not be private; as their dishonoring ministry occurs in public, so their humbling will occur before all the people. Showing partiality in instruction is a symptom of their defection from God's way.

### *Response*

<span id="page-747-3"></span>This passage is obviously relevant for pastors and all who lead Christian worship. But before turning to ourselves and our ministry, let us consider how we see in this passage an anticipation of that greater and perfect Priest, that true Son and perfect servant who fulfills every condition God lays out. It is Jesus who offers worship that fully honors God (1:6); it is Jesus who offers an utterly worthy sacrifice (v. 8) that God delightedly accepts (v. 9). He is the ultimate pastor-teacher, who saves many from sin (2:6–7). In Christ, Malachi's vision of worldwide worship (1:11, 14) comes true. And in Christ we are delivered from our natural yet irrational dissatisfaction with God that dishonors him and inevitably brings his curse (2:1–3). When we are alert to all that God has given us in his Son, it is especially difficult to find worship of him wearying or beneath our dignity (1:13).

<span id="page-747-8"></span><span id="page-747-7"></span><span id="page-747-6"></span>And yet, it may be that a pastor or worship leader is called to minister in a context that falls far below their hopes or expectations for their own career. Perhaps a difficult season of life leaves one dull and dissatisfied with God; perhaps the sheer weariness of months and years spent in service creates an unnoticed, dishonoring sloppiness in our worship. In these and other possible situations, it is easy to engage in the new covenant equivalent of offering lame and sick animals, thus tarnishing the glory of God before our congregation. Any attitude that considers God's service unworthy or not requiring our very best efforts reflects this sin.

<span id="page-747-11"></span><span id="page-747-5"></span><span id="page-747-2"></span>Malachi ministers to spiritual leaders under the new covenant in several ways in this passage. First, he exalts our weekly worship (1:11, 14), setting it in the glorious context of all creation's resounding with God's praise (Rev. 5:11–14). He also—sternly but not unlovingly—shows us God's refusal to lessen his own greatness by accepting unworthy worship (Mal. 1:9, 13). God's care for his own name—and for us—is too great (cf. Ezek. 36:22–23). Malachi warns us that God <span id="page-748-4"></span><span id="page-748-3"></span><span id="page-748-2"></span><span id="page-748-0"></span>can take away the benefits of a relationship with him if we stubbornly continue to be dissatisfied with him (2:1–3) and regard his worship as an embarrassment (1:7, 12). Malachi also gives us the opportunity to be rigorously honest about our failures in worship and in leading others in it, and shows us a God happy to reinstate us to his worship if we repent and glorify his name (2:2). Malachi assures us that God's warnings are meant to restore us (2:3–4). We see, furthermore, that God is not introducing a new, impossible standard when confronting his people's unworthy worship. Just as Malachi calls the people back to Mosaic prescriptions for worship, new covenant believers can turn again to NT descriptions of a healthy church (e.g., 1 Thess. 5:12–22; 2 Tim. 2:14–26; Titus 1:5–16). Finally, we learn the sobering truth that it is possible for God to shut down a worshiping community that continues to dishonor him (Mal. 1:10).

## *Comment*

<span id="page-749-6"></span>2:10–11 Malachi begins by contrasting the Judahites sins against each other with God's unchanging character. As in 1:6, Malachi invokes God as Father and Creator to show his attentive care, both in the present and at his people's creation. Malachi twice tells us that Judah's Father and Creator is "one," emphasizing the uniqueness and distinctiveness of Judah's God (Deut. 6:4; cf. the use of "one" in Song 6:9). The passage also creates a context in which Judahite betrayal appears all the more stark.

<span id="page-749-7"></span><span id="page-749-5"></span><span id="page-749-3"></span><span id="page-749-2"></span>"Betrayal" is not too strong a word for the verb rendered by "faithless" (Mal. 2:10–11; cf. Judg. 9:23; Prov. 11:3). The bonds of those under the covenant care of one Father should be inviolable, yet betrayal is pervasive in the postexilic community: Malachi says (lit.) "Each one betrays his brother," nationwide (Mal. 2:11). No individual in Malachi's audience can excuse himself from this rupture in which the entire community is implicated.

Finally, at the end of verse 11, we learn the nature of this betrayal: mixed marriages. Malachi has heightened his audience's expectation by delaying this information. Was it because such marriages were not regarded as problematic that Malachi overloads his expressions of covenant infidelity before revealing their source? Is Malachi helping his audience recalibrate their sensitivities before God in order to recognize an ugly betrayal where they saw none?

<span id="page-749-1"></span>Marriage with a member of another people group is problematic in the OT not because of the different race or ethnicity of the spouse but because of the competing spiritual commitments that person would bring to the marriage (cf. Deut. 7:3; Lev. 18:24–25 and its context; but note the exception of the marriage of the Moabite Ruth to Boaz because of her devotion to the Lord, Ruth 1:16). It is exactly this issue Malachi focuses on at the end of 2:11: the problem is not foreignness as such, but devotion to a foreign god. Such a spouse has a different spiritual father.

<span id="page-749-4"></span><span id="page-749-0"></span>Malachi calls such marriages a violation and sacrilege of the covenant (v. 10). The devotion and attention involved in marriage to a woman with other spiritual commitments betrays other Israelites by compromising the people's holy status as set apart for God's service and purposes. Furthermore, the sanctuary Yahweh loves, the sacred place where God and man meet, is desecrated by these marriages. This is the "abomination"; the same word describes the Canaanites' defiling the land in Leviticus 18:22, 26–30.

<span id="page-750-2"></span><span id="page-750-1"></span>The phrase "covenant of our fathers" does not distinguish a specific covenant (the phrase is used for the covenant with Abraham in Deut. 4:31; 7:12–14; 8:18; and for the covenant at Sinai in 2 Kings 17:15; Jer. 34:13). The phrase further binds the covenant community together: under one divine father, generations of Israelites have been keeping covenant with God. Thus mixed marriages damage the community's relationship not only with its God and its present members but also with its past. Spiritually faithless marriages have far-reaching consequences that Malachi's audience had probably not considered.

<span id="page-750-5"></span>Malachi includes himself in the question of 2:10 ("Why then are *we* faithless?") not because he had engaged in this betrayal but because he speaks as part of the community. It would be especially hypocritical for a prophet seeking to repair the unity of God's people to stand above and outside that community, condemning its faithlessness.

<span id="page-750-6"></span><span id="page-750-4"></span>2:12 Without an intervening question (as in 1:2, 6, etc.), Malachi moves directly to God's judgment on mixed marriages: as these Israelites have betrayed the covenant community, they will be excluded from it. The verb "cut off" (a form of *krt*) is frequently used in the Pentateuch for excommunication from the covenant community (and even for execution) for various transgressions (e.g., regarding the Passover in Ex. 12:15 or the peace offering in Lev. 7:20). The phrase "who brings an offering" shows that this curse falls on those who continue to participate in the worship of the covenant community as if no wrong has been done (this is exactly the situation in Neh. 13:23–31).

<span id="page-750-3"></span><span id="page-750-0"></span>The ESV's "any descendant" renders a confusing Hebrew phrase, "one who wakes and answers." Some understand this as a merism (a figure of speech expressing totality using contrasting parts), the point being that the Lord will cut off every last man who participates in mixed marriages; but since "wake" and "answer" are not obvious opposites, this is unlikely. Another possible translation is "protector and oppressor," another merism. A very slight change in the Hebrew (from *ʻer* to *ʻed*) would yield either "a witness or respondent" (another merism) or "a witness who answers," perhaps speaking of those who participate in such marriages. The ESV follows the Syriac and Aramaic translations here; if this is the correct reading, it fits well with Malachi 2:15. The meaning of the verse as a whole is clear whatever option one takes.

<span id="page-750-9"></span><span id="page-750-7"></span>2:13 In addition to this abomination, the Judahites commit a second sin: weeping and groaning because God no longer accepts their sacrifices. The Judahites probably thought highly of their pious grief, but the Lord rejects it as another failure in the covenant relationship. Although the people cannot seem to make the obvious connection, Malachi clarifies for them that the Lord refuses to receive covenantal worship as long as betrayal in marriage continues.

<span id="page-750-8"></span>2:14 Malachi varies the charge slightly from mixed marriages to divorce. (Although it is possible Judahite wives were being abandoned for foreign ones, the passage <span id="page-751-2"></span>does not make this connection explicit.) The divorced wife is described in three ways: "the wife of your youth," "your companion," and (lit.) "the wife of your covenant" (ESV, "your wife by covenant"). These terms intensify the betrayal involved in unnecessary divorce: it destroys a relationship with an ally and close friend that has existed for years (cf. the use of the word that is here translated "companion," in Judg. 20:11; Pss. 94:20; 119:63). The husband has entered into covenant with this woman—the most solemn formalizing of a relationship available to an ancient Israelite. The use of "covenant" echoes Malachi 2:10, and with this repetition Malachi helps his audience understand the far-reaching implications of these divorces.

<span id="page-751-4"></span><span id="page-751-0"></span>Finally, it should be noted that the Lord "was witness" on behalf of the abandoned wife. This verb is used for solemn testimony or warning when a serious wrong is alleged (cf. Deut. 8:19; Neh. 13:15; Amos 3:13). The Lord takes up the cause of these women, who had limited options to redress the wrong done to them.

<span id="page-751-7"></span><span id="page-751-5"></span>2:15–16 Malachi sets these divorces within the context of God's original intention for marriage, but the Hebrew is brief to the point of being cryptic. The first clause of verse 15 could be translated in a number of ways: "Not one acts (thus)," "Did not one make?" or "Did he not make (them) one?" The subsequent clauses could be woodenly rendered "And a portion of spirit to him [or "it"]. And what was the one seeking? Seed of God." Although the first clause might be saying that no one with a portion of God's spirit (or understanding) would act in this way regarding marriage, the ESV correctly interprets God as the subject of each clause: just as God's people as a whole are bound together by their one God and Father, so God makes a human couple one and seals their unity by giving a portion of his Spirit to "it," i.e., their oneness in marriage. God's intention is godly seed, a new generation of covenant believers. Marriage is defined by the one God in covenant with his (ideally) unified people, who (ideally) produce many offspring who continue in the spiritually unified covenant community. Divorce betrays this.

<span id="page-751-8"></span><span id="page-751-6"></span><span id="page-751-3"></span><span id="page-751-1"></span>Malachi closes the passage by calling for an end to all such frivolous divorces. The men initiating these divorces are to guard themselves in their own spirit (v. 15b). The focus changes from God's spirit to ours. Malachi warns Judahite husbands to protect themselves at the deepest level of their being against this kind of betrayal. Such great caution is needed because of God's strong opposition to divorce, aroused because of the violence caused by it (v. 16). (The point is the same regardless of which reading one accepts; cf. ESV mg.) To "cover one's garment with violence" may have a number of implications: perhaps hiding the violence committed against the wife, or completely contaminating the husband (cf. Ps. 73:6). Malachi may also be playing on the image of a man covering with his garment the woman he intends to marry (Deut. 22:30; Ruth 3:9; Ezek. 16:8), implying that an action of protection and commitment has been twisted into an act of violence. Such sin must not only stop—it is to be guarded against vigilantly.

### *Response*

In a deeply counterintuitive way, Malachi shows his audience how sins perhaps considered private fracture the community of which we are a part. Malachi connects the horizontal and vertical dimensions of our relationships within the sphere of the desired holiness of God's covenant people. When a member of the covenant commits himself to someone with a different spiritual father, or frivolously divorces his Christian spouse, he violates the covenant, betrays his Christian brothers and sisters who share in that covenant relationship, and sullies the place where we meet with God (2:10–11). God cares enough about our marriages to reject worship from his children who commit these betrayals (v. 13; cf. 1 Pet. 3:7). His judgment falls on those who do not repent of these sins (Mal. 2:12).

<span id="page-752-3"></span><span id="page-752-2"></span><span id="page-752-1"></span><span id="page-752-0"></span>In ancient Israel, the holiness of the temple and the people who worshiped there was not an abstraction. The Lord communicated his own heavenly beauty and moral uprightness to his people by sanctifying them (Lev. 19:2; 20:22–26) worship in the temple was a taste of heaven on earth! One part of that ideal vision extends to marriage within the covenant community. Although the tone of the passage is solemn and the warning serious, the intention is to guard a happy, fruitful community under the care of one Father, with undivided loyalties toward him as those who could become vulnerable to the financial, social, and emotional damage of divorce are kept safe.

<span id="page-752-6"></span><span id="page-752-5"></span>Without obscuring the severity of Malachi's warnings, it is appropriate to read them within the larger context of Scripture. The NT clarifies the greater spiritual mystery human marriage symbolizes: Christ's marriage to his church (Eph. 5:32). But unlike human husbands, Jesus Christ is perfectly faithful to his bride. Christ's perfect marriage to his church creates a context of grace within which reconciliation can be sought for a frivolous divorce that did not fall within those few situations in which the NT allows divorce (Matt. 19:9; 1 Cor. 7:10–16).

**<sup>17</sup>**You have wearied the Lord with your words. But you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delights in them." Or by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-753-5"></span>2:17 Here and in 3:13–14, Malachi begins his prophecy not with a direct statement from God to his people but by expressing God's weariness and disgust toward his people's speech about him. Although texts in Job and the Psalms are refreshingly open about the problem of delayed judgment, no other doubts about divine justice are as forceful as those voiced here. The community is not just suspicious about the nature or timing of God's judgment; it is blasphemously insisting God is actively pleased with those who fearlessly oppress others and violate his commands (cf. the longer description of these sins in v. 5). The normal categories of good and evil have been inverted, with God supposedly on the wrong side. Although it is easy to imagine jealous glances toward those who ignored God and seemed much happier for it (whether inside or outside the Judahite community) amid the difficulties of rebuilding the postexilic community, it is still shocking to hear this complaint from God's own people.

<span id="page-754-7"></span><span id="page-754-6"></span>3:1–5 Having registered his disgust at his people's despair, the Lord speaks no other word against them but answers their complaint as completely as possible. He points to his messenger (vv. 1–4), who will purify the priests when he personally appears to execute justice (v. 5).

<span id="page-754-2"></span><span id="page-754-0"></span>3:1 The Lord announces the sending of his messenger to prepare his way. The phrase "Behold, I send" recalls other royal pronouncements of sending messengers, human or otherwise, to execute justice (Ex. 8:21; Isa. 6:8; Jer. 43:10; Joel 2:19). Three times the verse emphasizes the immediacy of this action, twice with "Behold!" and once with "suddenly." The question "Where is the God of justice?" (Mal. 2:17) is already being answered—but not without irony. The repetition of "delight" from 2:17 is sarcastic, as the people in 2:17 were certainly not delighting in the Lord. Their cynicism is sarcastically described as "delighting in" and "seeking after" the Lord—who, because of his people's unbelief, is coming quickly.

<span id="page-754-10"></span><span id="page-754-4"></span><span id="page-754-1"></span>The messenger's purpose is to prepare the Lord's way as he personally draws near for judgment (3:5). The exact form of this preparation is described in verses 2–4 and strongly echoes Exodus 23:20 and Isaiah 40:3. Although the context is different from these earlier passages—the former speaks of God's angelic guidance as the people enter the Promised Land; the latter of his approach to escort his people back to the land after exile—all three concern God's ultimate goal of being directly present with his people, with all the blessed effects this implies.

<span id="page-754-9"></span><span id="page-754-5"></span><span id="page-754-3"></span>In the first sentence of Malachi 3:1, the Lord and his messenger are easy to distinguish. Through the end of verse 4, however, it becomes more difficult to discern the identity or number of those being described. The word *'adon*, translated as "the Lord" in the second sentence of verse 1, could possibly refer to a human master (the same word is used in both senses in 1:6). Additionally, it is possible that "my messenger" is distinguished from "the messenger of the covenant." As a result, it is possible that there are three distinct "messengers" at work in this verse: "my messenger," the "lord" as an authority figure, and "the messenger of the covenant."

Four considerations bring the passage into focus. First, *'adon* with the definite article always refers to the Lord elsewhere, so it makes best sense to understand it thus here; further, only the Lord can come to "his" temple. Second, the "messenger of the covenant" is probably the same as "my messenger"—if two different servants are intended, it would be odd to designate them with the same term (*mal'ak*). Third, the messenger and the Lord are to be distinguished. In the world of the OT, although a royal messenger speaks in the name and authority of the king, he is always distinct from him. Fourth, since God does not speak in the first person until 3:5, and no new actor is introduced in verses 2–4, it is best to understand verses 2–4 as the work of the messenger of the covenant.

<span id="page-754-8"></span>Against this interpretation is the use of divine terms to describe the messenger's appearance and work. Taken out of context, the question of verse 2 could easily be attributed to the Lord himself. Who else could spiritually refine God's people but their God? However, significant ambiguous overlap between the Lord and his <span id="page-755-0"></span>messenger occurs often in the OT (cf. Gen. 16:7–13; Ex. 23:20). The messenger's work is so closely identified with God's that they are described in virtually synonymous ways. This is probably why this messenger is described with the unique phrase "messenger of the covenant": he comes to repair the covenant relationship.

<span id="page-755-8"></span><span id="page-755-3"></span>3:2–4 The implicit answer to the question beginning verse 2 is "No one." On his own, no one is able to withstand the day of this messenger's appearing. The prophets very frequently describe God's swift-approaching theophany to judge evil in terms of burning fire (out of many examples, cf. Isa. 5:24; 9:17–18; 66:15–16), symbolizing his intensity, inner purity, and consuming passion to obliterate evil. Far from delighting in evildoers (Mal. 2:17), the Lord implies that those complaining about the absence of divine justice will not necessarily benefit when God acts through his messenger.

<span id="page-755-7"></span><span id="page-755-6"></span><span id="page-755-4"></span><span id="page-755-2"></span>But this is a refining and cleansing fire, not a wholly destructive one (3:2b); refining judgment is a common prophetic theme (Isa. 1:25; 48:10; Jer. 9:7; Dan. 11:35; 12:10; Zech. 13:9). The second sentence of the verse provides a note of hope amid coming judgment, for without this refining, God's people could not stand in his judgment (cf. Mal. 3:5). Part of the messenger's work is to cleanse God's people spiritually.

<span id="page-755-10"></span><span id="page-755-9"></span><span id="page-755-1"></span>The messenger "sits" (v. 3) as the refining continues for some time before it is complete. Strikingly, the object of this purification is the Levites (v. 3), even though it appears that *all* the people are complaining (2:17) and that the apparently successful rebels are spread throughout the people (3:5). God's judgment and execution of justice begins with his own servants in his house (which explains the reference to the temple in v. 1). Only after the priests are cleansed (the verb translated "purify" in verse 3 often refers to ritual cleanness in Leviticus—e.g., 12:4, 6–8) will sacrificial worship again be pleasing to God. Strikingly, these offerings are then offered "in righteousness"—by implication, Judah's sloppy worship is one of the injustices complained about in Malachi 2:17. Thus the first injustice God addresses is the unworthy worship of him. Only after the restoration of fitting worship does God proceed more directly to his people's complaint. In 1:6–14, pure worship is related to the ever-spreading worship of God; here it is linked to execution of justice.

<span id="page-755-5"></span>3:5 Once his own people have been refined, the Lord executes justice on those rebelling against him (2:17)—not from a distance but by personally drawing near. The Lord's acting as a witness represents the whole process of justice; his "swift" witness resolves the complaint beginning the passage. No longer will the people ask where the God of justice is, as he judges crimes ranging from false worship to sexual sin to oppression of the poor.

### *Response*

Although some are blessed to labor in times of great and obvious blessing, many in ministry (and more broadly) are vulnerable to nursing a sense of injustice at the contrast between their own lives and the happy lives of those who live heedless of God. This passage emphatically insists that God is not slow to judge wrongdoing. When

<span id="page-756-2"></span><span id="page-756-0"></span>The gospels identify the messenger of the covenant with John the Baptist, and the Lord (Mal. 3:1) with Jesus (Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27). It is in Jesus Christ that God works out ultimate justice for his discouraged people and judgment on those who do not fear him (Matt. 3:12). Reflection on the partial fulfillment of Malachi's prophecy in the Gospels, while looking forward to its full and complete fulfillment in the second coming, will guard us from any blasphemous resentment of God as we walk the hard road of his service.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-757-7"></span><span id="page-757-6"></span>3:6–7a Perhaps partially in response to the complaint beginning the last passage, the Lord recontextualizes the covenant relationship. Instead of unfair treatment, the history of God's people has been one of consistent defection and unfaithfulness, despite consistent goodness on God's part. The only reason God's people have not been consumed in judgment is God's stubborn goodness and mercy, rooted in his very character. In a further extension of grace to his people, God invites them to break with their past by making a suitable response to their God (cf. Zech. 1:3). As the passage proceeds, he will show them how to return. Although the covenant relationship should have been destroyed long ago, the entire history of Israel's sin and its consequences can be forgiven, replaced by a fresh intimacy with God and his blessings. At the same time, the call to return implies that God will not continue with a people who persist in defection.

<span id="page-757-8"></span>3:7b–8 The people's response at the end of verse 7 could be translated, "In what have we turned from you?" Although many statutes have been broken (v. 7), the Lord specifies the tithe—but not before asking a question to destabilize his audience, disrupting whatever justification they might have had for what they considered a meaningless omission. The question beginning verse 8 implies the impossibility of what is asked; the imperfect verb could be translated, "Could a man rob God?" Failure in tithing actualizes the impossibility—keeping something from God that is legitimately his. Human presumption of total ownership in a world in which God owns everything (Ps. 50:10–11) is deeply resistant to real worship and devotion. Little wonder God calls his people to return!

<span id="page-757-5"></span><span id="page-757-1"></span>3:9 Part of biblical prophecy is the explanation of the present decay of the covenant relationship even when its causes should have been obvious. The covenant curses have come into effect—specifically, marauding animals (v. 11; cf. Lev. 26:6, 22; Deut. 28:38–42). The entire nation is implicated in this sin and, continuing in it, they are heedless of its effects.

<span id="page-757-3"></span><span id="page-757-2"></span>3:10 While there is a testing of God that comes from hardheartedness (Deut. 6:16), God's invitation to "test" him here is an insistence on his unchanging faithfulness to his promises and goodness to his people. The command to test asserts the impossibility of God's failing to respond to his people's obedience.

<span id="page-757-11"></span><span id="page-757-4"></span><span id="page-757-0"></span>Three times verse 10 emphasizes the Lord's disproportionately generous response to Judah's obedience in tithing. First, "windows of heaven" recalls the flood that destroyed all creation (Gen. 7:11) and the unbelievable abundance of 2 Kings 7:1–2. Second, the Lord promises to "empty" (AT) the heavens of rain; he will hold nothing back. Third, the final phrase, translated "until there is no more

<span id="page-758-2"></span><span id="page-758-0"></span>need," means something stronger: "until there is a wearing out of sufficiency" (a somewhat similar phrase is found in Ps. 72:7). The Lord is promising an overwhelming blessing, more than the people are able to use (cf. Lev. 26:10). When Israel is asked to give back a fraction of what was never truly theirs, God responds with everything he has.

<span id="page-758-5"></span><span id="page-758-4"></span>3:11 The happy consequences of Judah's future obedience accrue as God promises to remove the curse (v. 9) that is destroying the fruit of their soil.

<span id="page-758-6"></span><span id="page-758-3"></span><span id="page-758-1"></span>3:12 The promised blessing will be so great that even those outside of Israel will notice. Instead of appalled shock at Israel's judgment (Lev. 26:21), the nations will call them "blessed." Although this verse does not speak of the nations' joining in worship, as in Malachi 1:14, it is difficult to separate the blessing the nations pronounce from that future hope. Malachi's audience probably had no idea that their failure to tithe was hindering a blessing that would attract the respect of foreign nations. The implications of the obedience of God's people reach beyond their borders.

Finally, the land of God's obedient people is not merely blessed, but delightful. God promises not only abundance but also the happiness and delight he gives to those who trust him enough to obey.

### *Response*

<span id="page-758-8"></span>Sometimes we are negligent in our relationship with God in ways we consider trifling but that actually amount to spiritual defection. How we spend money reveals a great deal about us. Although the NT does not insist on an exact amount to be given (2 Cor. 9:7), certain difficulties and hardships Christians experience may be due to negligence in this area—and faithfulness will be matched by God with a generosity those outside the church cannot help but notice. Even if the blessing may at times change in the new covenant from external, financial, or agricultural bounty to inward, spiritual blessing, the same God is consistently faithful to repentant people.

## <span id="page-758-7"></span>MALACHI 3:13–4:3

**<sup>13</sup>** "Your words have been hard against me, says the Lord. But you say, 'How have we spoken against you?' **14**You have said, 'It is vain to serve God.

## *Comment*

<span id="page-759-4"></span><span id="page-759-1"></span><span id="page-759-0"></span>3:13 The Lord's initial charge against Judah involves more than merely rude or inconsiderate speech. The same phrase is found in 2 Samuel 24:4 and 1 Chronicles 21:4, where David overrules Joab's advice. The Judahites seem to be not only dishonoring God with their speech but also forcefully insisting on their cynical theology (confirmed by the particular phrasing beginning Mal. 3:15, which might be paraphrased, "From now on, we are calling . . ."). Their minds are made up.

<span id="page-759-7"></span><span id="page-759-6"></span><span id="page-759-5"></span><span id="page-759-2"></span>3:14–15 The charge of injustice against God is the same as in 2:17. On the one hand, they feel that serving God has made their lives worse (3:14). This is the implication of the question in verse 14: their service in God's presence causes mourning, <span id="page-760-12"></span><span id="page-760-11"></span><span id="page-760-4"></span>not joy. They have nothing to show for their labor, so their service is in vain. On the other hand, it seems to them that moral and spiritual rebels run free and prosper (v. 15), a complaint about those within the Judahite community who were defying God. Although the people's complaint is not limited to priests, verse 14 alludes to temple service. "Keeping God's charge" is frequently used of Levitical duties in the sanctuary (Num. 3:7, 28, 32; 18:3–5; Ezek. 40:45–46; 44:14–16), recalling the use of *ʻabad* ("serve") for ritual worship in the tabernacle (cf. Ex. 3:12; 4:23; 10:26; 12:31; 13:5) and the command in legal texts to rejoice before God there (Lev. 23:40; Deut. 12:7; 16:1; 27:7). As is often the case in Malachi and other parts of the OT, the people's relationship with God finds its heart in the temple—but, in contrast to other passages in the OT, here their service produces only mourning, not joy.

<span id="page-760-13"></span><span id="page-760-10"></span><span id="page-760-9"></span><span id="page-760-5"></span><span id="page-760-1"></span><span id="page-760-0"></span>3:16 For the first time in Malachi, there is a positive response to the prophet's preaching: instead of a second rebuttal from the people (as in 1:6–7 and 3:7–8), a group within the community takes counsel together. The verb for speaking in verse 16 (a form of *dbr*) is the same as in verse 13, forming a hopeful contrast: instead of continuing to complain, and without any direct command from God, they discuss their response to the prophetic word. The book written "before him" produces a similar contrast with Israel's complaint of mourning "before the Lord" in verse 14. The complaint directly before God's presence dissolves into repentance before him. Even happier is God's attention to their response before the book of remembrance is mentioned, registered with two separate verbs. Although the phrase "the Lord paid attention and heard" would fit easily at the end of the verse, its earlier location implies God's attention to his people's repentance.

<span id="page-760-8"></span><span id="page-760-7"></span><span id="page-760-6"></span><span id="page-760-3"></span><span id="page-760-2"></span>The "book of remembrance" is similar to references to a book belonging to God seen elsewhere in the OT; most often the context suggests a record of those who belong to him (Ex. 32:32–33; Dan. 12:1; cf. Rev. 20:15), while Psalm 139:16 reveals a book narrating the course of the lives of God's saints. Sometimes God's enemies are erased from his book (Ps. 69:28), while Exodus 17:14 records (in a phrase very similar to this verse) a book to remember the Lord's perpetual antipathy toward Amalek. Official public lists of Israelites were also kept (Neh. 7:5; 12:23; Ezek. 13:9), and there is a single reference to a Persian "book of remembrance" of Persian royal history (Est. 6:1). Even if this practice is not otherwise well known, these other books suggest this "book of remembrance" records a list of those within the community who publicly recommitted themselves to the Lord. (As we will see, the meaning of "treasured possession" in Mal. 3:17 and the discriminatory nature of the judgment in 4:1–3 support this.) The other OT references listed above suggest this is God's book, written "before him" in heaven by a recording angel, by which he records those within the postexilic community who have repented of their cynicism. This remnant remains within God's realm of blessing, much in contrast to the complaint voiced in the previous verses.

<span id="page-760-15"></span><span id="page-760-14"></span>The verse ends by specifying that those in this book fear God and esteem his name. Fearing God in the OT connotes basic reverence and devotion as the basis <span id="page-761-5"></span><span id="page-761-1"></span>of any relationship with him (Deut. 10:12; Job 1:1; Prov. 1:7). To "esteem" God's name is a phrase not found elsewhere in the OT, but it makes sense against the background of Malachi 3:13–15: complaining of the futility of serving God is the opposite of thinking of God's fame and reputation above one's own comfort (cf. 1:11, 14).

<span id="page-761-13"></span><span id="page-761-10"></span><span id="page-761-7"></span><span id="page-761-4"></span>3:17–18 We hear the Lord's response to the repentance of verse 16. He promises, "They will be mine—my treasured possession, on the day I am making" (AT). The constant emphasis on the day of the Lord in 4:1–3 ("on the day I am making" is exactly repeated at the end of 4:3), together with the future tense verbs in 3:17–18, suggest that God is making a promise that will come into effect at the day described in 4:1–3. A "treasured possession" (*segullah*) refers to the private property of a king amid his ownership of everything in his kingdom (1 Chron. 29:3; Eccles. 2:8). Israel as a whole is given this distinction—in explicit contrast to the other nations—in Exodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 7:6; 14:2; 26:18. Unusually within the OT, this term is applied to a faithful remnant within the larger community of God's people: those in the book of remembrance will personally belong to God on the coming day.

<span id="page-761-3"></span><span id="page-761-2"></span><span id="page-761-0"></span>The verb "spare" (Mal. 3:17) can also mean "have pity on" (Ezek. 16:5; Joel 2:18). Both senses are probably in view: God will renew his compassion on these Godfearers, as any father would, and spare them from the coming judgment. These God-fearers will see that the complaint of Malachi 3:14–15 is groundless: God will act to make evident the distinction between righteous and wicked, between the one serving God and the one serving self. In making this promise, he implies that the complaint in verses 13–15 is not entirely a problem of perception on Judah's part; the value and benefit of serving God and the distinction between the righteous and the wicked are not (yet) fully realized. At the same time, of course, the Lord's insistence on the coming distinction between these two groups should vitiate any jealousy of the wicked who prosper in this life.

<span id="page-761-9"></span><span id="page-761-6"></span>4:1 If 3:17–18 lays out the God-fearers' hope, 4:1 shows how these expectations become a reality. Although many other prophetic texts describe God's action "on that day," and God's direct appearance is often described in terms of fire, this prophetic text is unique in describing *the day itself* as burning up the wicked. In Malachi's deployment of these common prophetic themes, the fire of God's appearance reduces the arrogant and evildoers of 3:15 to ash; there is no escape, and whatever temporary gains they made before that day are forever consumed. This judgment is both swift and total: the day is twice described as "coming," and neither root nor branch is left. The coming distinction between righteous and wicked (3:18) will be unmistakable.

<span id="page-761-12"></span><span id="page-761-11"></span><span id="page-761-8"></span>4:2–3 The ESV correctly expresses the contrast between verses 1 and 2 by stating, "But for you." "Fearing God's name" (cf. v. 2) combines the two phrases in 3:16 ("feared the Lord" and "esteemed his name") for those recorded in the book of remembrance, indicating they receive this promise. The promise's imagery is consistent with that of 4:1 even while shifting it: for the God-fearers, this day holds not unquenchable fire but a shining sun. This is most likely a metaphor for the fiery theophany of the Lord on that day.

<span id="page-762-9"></span><span id="page-762-6"></span><span id="page-762-3"></span><span id="page-762-0"></span>In the OT, the Lord is explicitly compared to a sun only in Psalm 84:11, although in a few other places he "shines forth" (cf. Deut. 33:2 and Isa. 60:1–2, which use the verb translated "rise" in Mal. 4:2; Hab. 3:3 has a similar image). The context of Psalm 84 shows that the metaphor clearly connotes blessing and protection. The image of the sun means the same here: God-fearers will be protected from the judgment of Malachi 4:1 and will enjoy God's blessing, like the well-fed, carefree, playful animals of verse 2. Malachi qualifies this sun as a sun "of righteousness" to connect this blessing and judgment to the complaint of God's treatment of the just and unjust in 3:13–15. This "righteous" sun works the judgment and blessing called for earlier in the passage. The healing this sun brings should be understood in relation to blessing: healing in the OT is not limited to recovery from illness but includes restoration from all kinds of tragedy and loss (cf. 2 Chron. 7:14; Ps. 107:20; Prov. 4:22; 6:15; Jer. 8:15; 14:19; 33:6). This healing sun restores the God-fearers to fullness of life and peace.

<span id="page-762-7"></span><span id="page-762-2"></span>The reference to the sun's "wings" is strange to us, but Malachi's original audience would have been reminded of the chief Persian deity Ahura Mazda, commonly portrayed with a winged sun disk. In a Persian context, a king portrayed within this winged sun disk was under the blessing and protection of the deity. Malachi's image is not a compromise with pagan religion but a hint that the blessing and protection Persian worship promises is found actually in the Lord. There are numerous other examples of Yahweh appropriating roles or actions from pagan deities in order to convince his people that he is the only God who can actually perform the salvation other gods promise; the Lord's sending of a storm in 1 Kings 18 to humiliate the storm god Baal is one prominent instance.

<span id="page-762-10"></span><span id="page-762-8"></span><span id="page-762-1"></span>Malachi 4:3 shows what the frolicking animals are trampling on: the wicked of 3:15 and 4:1. The explanatory phrase "for they will be ashes" clarifies that the God-fearers do not themselves execute judgment; the wicked are already burned up in the coming day. But the God-fearers do participate in this judgment and the restoration of moral order. Whatever evil remains is stomped on and crushed into nothing by God's own people. The mourning of God's servants as the wicked enjoy everything good in life is resolved decisively as God's servants themselves are given a role in the restoration of all things.

<span id="page-762-5"></span><span id="page-762-4"></span>Passages of Scripture looking forward to the judgment of the wicked, and even envisioning some role for God's people in it, easily offend modern sensibilities. While modern unease with passages like this is understandable, it is worth remembering that a key characteristic of the wicked in the OT is unrepentant and violent selfishness. Limiting ourselves to the prophets, the wicked are described as preying on others (Jer. 5:26), making a habit of violence (Ezek. 7:11), enriching themselves by robbing others (Mic. 6:11), twisting justice (Hab. 1:4), and creating <span id="page-763-2"></span><span id="page-763-1"></span><span id="page-763-0"></span>moral and social chaos where everyone suffers (Isa. 1:21–23). Although God excludes no nation from his worship (Mal. 1:14), his kingdom cannot come, nor his reign be fully realized, without destroying this evil and the people who give themselves to it. In fact, without this judgment, it would truly be useless to serve God (3:14). And if the Lord gives his servants some limited role in the restoration of right on that great and final day, will we refuse? Is our sense of justice more refined that God's?

#### *Response*

<span id="page-763-3"></span>Any Christian never tempted to voice the complaint of 3:14 may need to ask himself if he is working hard enough. Before the redemption of all things, it will often appear that God's servants win only gloom for their sacrifice, while those openly defiant of God not only enjoy themselves but are "blessed" (v. 15)—enjoying the quality of life that those close to the Lord could reasonably expect. Malachi's response is not to deny the difficulties of serving God, as if there were some other benefits of which his audience was unaware, but rather to broaden their perspective. In other words, there is a sense in which Malachi agrees that serving God, before the day of the Lord, does not necessarily confer the blessed and full life each of us desires. But God's work on that great and final day will so utterly rebalance whatever loss is sustained before the end of all things that all of our complaints will vanish. God's saints will even be granted a role in that restoration. The judgment and healing of this day was inaugurated in God's work in Christ and will be completed when Christ comes again (cf. the image of the rising sun in Luke 1:78–79 with Mal. 4:2).

<span id="page-763-5"></span><span id="page-763-4"></span>It is appropriate for us, living "in between the times," to reflect on the repentance of the faithful remnant in 3:16. Before any warnings or promises are made, without any other incentive, those fearing God bind themselves publicly and unconditionally to the Lord in a way that carries great weight with God. Even amid the inequalities in which God's ministers labor, we are given an example of "early" repentance and we see how quickly God responds to such repentance, as promises to the God-fearers echo through this description of the day of the Lord.

**<sup>5</sup>** "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. **6**And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction."*<sup>2</sup>*

1Or *and just decrees* 2The Hebrew term rendered *decree of utter destruction* refers to things devoted (or set apart) to the Lord (or by the Lord) for destruction

## <span id="page-764-11"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-764-6"></span><span id="page-764-3"></span><span id="page-764-2"></span>4:4 The Mosaic covenant is in the background throughout Malachi; many of the prophet's concerns are first laid out in Exodus–Deuteronomy, such as sacrifice and worship (Mal. 1:8–10, 12–13; 2:12; 3:4), the priesthood (2:1–9); and the tithe (3:8). The law also acted as a rallying point for the spiritual reconstitution of the postexilic community (Nehemiah 8). As Malachi's audience awaits fulfillment of the promises of this book, the Lord's expectations for them have not changed since the earliest stages of the covenant relationship. In fact, Deuteronomy itself already frequently calls Israel to "remember" (Deut. 5:15; 7:18; 8:2, 18; 9:7). Although a terser command ("Remember Moses") would probably have been sufficient to communicate the continuing need for covenant faithfulness, Malachi spurs their memory by reminding them of the divine origin of these laws ("that I commanded") and the place of their giving ("Horeb"), original audience ("all Israel"), and content ("statutes and rules").

<span id="page-764-7"></span><span id="page-764-5"></span><span id="page-764-4"></span><span id="page-764-1"></span><span id="page-764-0"></span>4:5 Malachi neatly summarizes the two "day of the Lord" passages (2:17–3:5; 3:13–4:3). The phrase "Behold, I will send" in 4:5 echoes 3:1, while the reference to the coming day echoes 4:1. The close wording prompts us to understand Elijah as the coming messenger, unidentified in 3:1. In addition to his pedigree as a great servant of God, the fact that Elijah apparently avoided physical death (2 Kings 2) makes him an obvious candidate for the final prophetic figure to prepare God's people before the coming day. There seems to have been an expectation of a literal return of Elijah in Jesus' day (Matt. 17:10), but Jesus declares John the Baptist to be the fulfillment of this prophecy (Matt. 11:14).

<span id="page-764-14"></span><span id="page-764-13"></span><span id="page-764-12"></span>4:6 The description of the coming Elijah's ministry of reconciling fathers and sons may seem strange, since nothing has been said elsewhere in the book about generational strife. Malachi probably places the fundamental relationship between father and son as a synecdoche for the healing of God's people. Just as the whole law is summarized in the commandment to love one another (Gal. 5:14), so Malachi summarizes the breaches in the covenant relationship by referring to this basic relationship between father and son.

<span id="page-765-2"></span><span id="page-765-1"></span><span id="page-765-0"></span>The threat of a "decree of utter destruction" ending Malachi 4:6 translates a single Hebrew word (*herem*, translated "devote to destruction" in Deut. 7:2; Josh. 10:39; 11:12; 1 Sam. 15:3; etc.). In these earlier passages, *herem* was the final and irredeemable act of destructive judgment against evil and those who practiced it. It is tied to the "re-sanctification" of the territory where the abominable deeds were practiced (cf. Deut. 7:2 together with vv. 5–6). While this can seem a harsh way to end the book, it is not a bald threat to obey or be destroyed. Rather, God promises a messenger who will prepare his people so that judgment can be avoided. The consecutive perfect verb form beginning Malachi 4:6 is a "prophetic" perfect, showing a future certainty. Without being asked, the Lord sends a prophet to prepare his people so that his coming can be a blessing.

## *Response*

As the final Prophetic Book of the OT ends, the Lord shows us the simplicity of his requirements as we await the day of his appearing. God promises that he will send a prophet to prepare his people for that coming day. As new covenant believers, we have the benefit of seeing the fulfillment of this short passage in the work of John the Baptist, who prepared the way for Jesus. As we await the second coming of Christ, we continually look back to Jesus, our greater Moses, through whom God finally and ultimately spoke his will, and we keep ourselves ready for that great and final day.
