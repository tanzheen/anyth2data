### PREFACE

### TO THE ESV EXPOSITORY COMMENTARY

The Bible pulsates with life, and the Spirit conveys the electrifying power of Scripture to those who lay hold of it by faith, ingest it, and live by it. God has revealed himself in the Bible, which makes the words of Scripture sweeter than honey, more precious than gold, and more valuable than all riches. These are the words of life, and the Lord has entrusted them to his church, for the sake of the world.

He has also provided the church with teachers to explain and make clear what the Word of God means and how it applies to each generation. We pray that all serious students of God's Word, both those who seek to teach others and those who pursue study for their own personal growth in godliness, will be served by the ESV Expository Commentary. Our goal has been to provide a clear, crisp, and Christ-centered explanation of the biblical text. All Scripture speaks of Christ (Luke 24:27), and we have sought to show how each biblical book helps us to see the "light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6).

To that end, each contributor has been asked to provide commentary that is:

- *exegetically sound*—self-consciously submissive to the flow of thought and lines of reasoning discernible in the biblical text;
- *robustly biblical-theological*—reading the Bible as diverse yet bearing an overarching unity, narrating a single storyline of redemption culminating in Christ;
- *globally aware*—aimed as much as possible at a global audience, in line with Crossway's mission to provide the Bible and theologically responsible resources to as many people around the world as possible;
- *broadly reformed*—standing in the historical stream of the Reformation, affirming that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, taught in Scripture alone, for God's glory alone; holding high a big God with big grace for big sinners;
- *doctrinally conversant*—fluent in theological discourse; drawing appropriate brief connections to matters of historical or current theological importance;
- *pastorally useful*—transparently and reverently "sitting under the text"; avoiding lengthy grammatical/syntactical discussions;
- *application-minded*—building brief but consistent bridges into contemporary living in both Western and non-Western contexts (being aware of the globally diverse contexts toward which these volumes are aimed);

• *efficient in expression*—economical in its use of words; not a word-byword analysis but a crisply moving exposition.

In terms of Bible translation, the ESV is the base translation used by the authors in their notes, but the authors were expected to consult the text in the original languages when doing their exposition and were not required to agree with every decision made by the ESV translators.

As civilizations crumble, God's Word stands. And we stand on it. The great truths of Scripture speak across space and time, and we aim to herald them in a way that will be globally applicable.

May God bless the study of his Word, and may he smile on this attempt to expound it.

### INTRODUCTION TO EPHESIANS

### *Overview*

<span id="page-19-4"></span><span id="page-19-3"></span><span id="page-19-2"></span><span id="page-19-0"></span>The apostle Paul wrote this letter to Christians living in (or near) Ephesus in order to strengthen their faith, promote their unity, and exhort them to holiness. In the first half of the book (Ephesians 1–3), Paul provides a solid theological foundation as he (1) reminds his readers of God's great grace and the spiritual blessings believers possess based on their union with Christ (1:3–14), (2) prays for them to grow in their knowledge of God and what he has done for them in Christ (1:15–23), (3) emphasizes the grace of God in the salvation of believers (2:1–10), (4) describes the plight of the Gentiles as those who were alienated from God and his people but now may be accepted as a result of their being united to Christ through faith (2:11–22), (5) describes his unique ministry to the Gentiles and how that relates to the "divine mystery" (3:1–13), and (6) offers a second prayer for his readers, that they will be strengthened, will be able to comprehend the love of Christ, and will be filled with the fullness of God (3:14–21).

He exhorts the Ephesian believers to walk in unity (4:1–6) while recognizing that diversity is needed for building up the body of Christ (4:7–16). Next, Paul exhorts them not to walk (i.e., live) as unbelieving Gentiles but to put off the old self and put on the new (4:17–24). They are to do so by imitating God and walking in love (4:25–5:2). They are to avoid immorality and greed and instead live in the light (5:3–14). They are to walk carefully, being wise, understanding God's will, and being filled with the Spirit (5:15–21). Paul also addresses various relationships within the church, including those between (1) wives and husbands (5:22–33), (2) children and parents (6:1–4), and (3) slaves and masters (6:5–9). Finally, he emphasizes that believers must acknowledge the reality of spiritual warfare and the need to be prepared for battle (6:10–20). They are to stand firm by putting on the whole armor of God, which includes persevering in prayer. Paul concludes his letter with a commendation of Tychicus and a final benediction (6:21–24).

### <span id="page-19-17"></span><span id="page-19-16"></span><span id="page-19-15"></span><span id="page-19-14"></span>*Title*

<span id="page-19-1"></span>This letter is named after its recipients and the city in which they lived ("to the saints who are in Ephesus"; 1:1). Along with Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon, it is known as one of the "Prison Epistles," since it was most likely written during a two-year imprisonment in Rome.

### *Author*

The author identifies himself as "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God" (1:1) and "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles" (3:1).1 Paul was a former Pharisee and persecutor of Christians who was converted on his way to Damascus (c. AD 35) and called by Christ to be his apostle. He became one of the church's greatest missionary-theologians, authoring thirteen books of the NT.

### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-20-10"></span><span id="page-20-8"></span>The most likely date for Paul's writing of Ephesians is during his imprisonment in Rome (AD 60–62). Paul refers to his imprisonment in all of the Prison Epistles (Phil. 1:7, 13, 14, 16, 17; Col. 4:3, 10; Philem. 1, 9, 10, 13, 23). In Ephesians he identifies himself as "a prisoner of Christ Jesus" (3:1), "a prisoner for the Lord" (4:1), and "an ambassador in chains" (6:20). According to Acts 28:30, Paul spent two years in Rome under house arrest, with the freedom to receive visitors.

<span id="page-20-7"></span><span id="page-20-0"></span>Identifying the precise occasion for the letter is difficult, for it is the most general and therefore the least situational of all of Paul's letters. It is written primarily, though not exclusively, to Gentile Christians (Eph. 2:11–12; 3:1; 4:17). These readers know of Paul's imprisonment (3:13; 4:1) and will receive a visit from Tychicus, who will inform them further of Paul's situation.

<span id="page-20-9"></span>Identifying the purpose of the letter has also been a challenge. There are, however, several goals that Paul seems to have in its writing: (1) to strengthen the faith of his readers by reminding them of their union with Christ, which results in untold blessings, (2) to promote Jew-Gentile unity, and (3) to exhort his readers to pursue holiness, which involves fighting against the powers of darkness.

### *Genre and Literary Structure*

<span id="page-20-3"></span>Similar to other Pauline letters, Ephesians follows a typical epistolary structure. It begins with the usual prescript, which includes the author, recipients, and greeting (1:1–2). Paul adds that he is "an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God" and that his addressees are "saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus" (1:1). In addition, the usual Hellenistic greeting is expanded: "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (1:2).

<span id="page-20-5"></span><span id="page-20-4"></span><span id="page-20-2"></span><span id="page-20-1"></span>Unlike most of Paul's other letters, which then include a thanksgiving and/or prayer, Ephesians then has a long section in which Paul blesses God for the blessings believers receive through their union with Christ (1:3–14). The only other letter that contains a similar blessing or eulogy is 2 Corinthians (2 Cor. 1:3–7). The next section contains a thanksgiving and a prayer for the Ephesian believers (Eph. 1:15–23; cf. 3:14–21).

<span id="page-20-6"></span><sup>1</sup> For further discussion of the authorship of Ephesians, see Interpretive Challenges below.

<span id="page-21-7"></span><span id="page-21-5"></span><span id="page-21-1"></span>The body of Ephesians can be divided into two sections: the doctrinal or theological section (1:3–3:21) and the ethical or practical section (4:1–6:20). Paul's use of the imperative mood supports this division. Of the forty imperatives in the letter, only one is found in the first section (2:11), with the other thirty-nine occurring in the second section. The first three verses of the ethical section (4:1–3) form the basic thrust of what chapters 4–6 seek to accomplish, with the key word "walk" appearing in each major portion of this section (4:17 [2x]; 5:2, 8, 15; cf. 2:2, 10). The body concludes with an exhortation to prayer, serving as a climax of the entire letter (6:10–20).

<span id="page-21-10"></span><span id="page-21-8"></span><span id="page-21-6"></span><span id="page-21-4"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>Throughout the body of the letter, several other literary features are found. Paul includes four explicit OT quotations (e.g., Ps. 68:18 in 4:8) and many OT allusions, evidenced by the use of key OT terms and concepts (election, helmet of salvation, hope, Father, mercy, promise, redemption, temple, wisdom). Paul seems also to employ early Christian traditional material (Eph. 4:4–6; 5:14) as well as "household codes" similar to those of Greco-Roman literature, in which he addresses relationships between wives and husbands, children and fathers, and slaves and masters (5:22–6:9). Following the body of the letter, Ephesians concludes with a final greeting, including a reference to the bearer of the letter, Tychicus (6:21–22), as well as a concluding prayer (6:23) and benediction (6:24).

### <span id="page-21-12"></span><span id="page-21-11"></span><span id="page-21-9"></span>*Theology of Ephesians*

The rich theology of the letter to the Ephesians has elevated it to a place of prominence among Paul's letters. Harold Hoehner comments, "The Letter to the Ephesians is one of the most influential documents in the Christian church,"2 and Peter O'Brien says, "The Letter to the Ephesians is one of the most significant documents ever written."3 Although there are many topics we could examine in this introduction, we will emphasize three that are intimately related to the occasion and purpose of the letter.

#### CHRISTOLOGY

First, Paul emphasizes the pivotal role of Christ. Paul bases the blessings and privileges believers possess firmly on the work of Christ, using various terms such as Christ (46x), Jesus (20x), Lord (23x), and Son of God (1x).4 Many of these titles are used in combination, such as "Jesus Christ," "Christ Jesus," and "the Lord Jesus Christ." In addition, Paul not only uses the phrase "in Christ" nine times, he also uses various constructions conveying the same idea, such as "in him" (5x), "in whom" (7x), or "in the beloved" (1x). The focus of Ephesians is not so much the believer's union with Christ in his death (though cf. 1:7; 2:13, 16; 5:2, 25) but the believer's union with him in his resurrection, exaltation, and enthronement (1:20–23; 2:5–6). All the spiritual blessings believers receive are "in Christ." Christ

All things are put in subjection to him, and he is the head over all things (1:22). It is through the blood of Christ that believers are brought near to God, which results in peace (2:13–14). Christ himself is the cornerstone of the church (2:20) and has given leadership gifts to his church (4:7–11). The church is both the bride of Christ (5:25, 32) and the body of Christ (1:23; 4:12; 5:23, 30). Finally, Paul underscores the present benefits a believer possesses as a consequence of being in Christ; they are not merely future benefits.

### <span id="page-22-3"></span>ECCLESIOLOGY

<span id="page-22-10"></span><span id="page-22-6"></span>Second, Paul highlights the importance of the church. The term itself occurs nine times in this letter, along with other expressions referring to the community of believers. Although in his other letters Paul usually focuses on the church as a local expression of God's people, in Ephesians the universal church receives greater attention (1:22; 3:10, 21; 5:23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32). A major emphasis is placed on the unity Jews and Gentiles experience because of their common salvation. Because the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles has been torn down, the two have become one (2:14), thus creating "one new man" (2:15). Those redeemed by Christ are "fellow citizens" and "members of the household of God" (2:19). Together they constitute a unique building, a "holy temple," that has become "a dwelling place for God" (2:21–22). Walking in a manner worthy of God's calling, they must be "eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (4:3). Paul then declares, "There is one body and one Spirit . . . one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all" (4:4–6). The church is also pictured as the bride and body of Christ. Finally, Christ rules over his church as "head" (1:22–23; 4:15; 5:23).

### <span id="page-22-13"></span><span id="page-22-12"></span><span id="page-22-9"></span><span id="page-22-7"></span><span id="page-22-2"></span>SANCTIFICATION

<span id="page-22-20"></span><span id="page-22-19"></span><span id="page-22-18"></span><span id="page-22-17"></span><span id="page-22-16"></span><span id="page-22-15"></span><span id="page-22-11"></span><span id="page-22-4"></span>Third, Paul stresses the need for believers to lead godly lives. Since they are united with Christ, it is imperative that Christians' lives be consistent with that reality. He therefore reminds his readers to be who they already are in Christ. Though formerly they were "strangers and aliens," they are now "fellow citizens" (2:19). As Gentiles they once walked "in the futility of their minds" (4:17), but they must no longer live as those who "are darkened in their understanding," who live in "ignorance," who have hard hearts (4:18), who "have given themselves up to sensuality," or who "practice every kind of impurity" (4:19). Rather, Paul urges them to remember where they came from (2:11) and "to walk in a manner worthy" of their calling (4:1). They are to "put off" their old self (4:22) and "put on the new self" (4:24), which is created for righteousness and holiness. They are to watch carefully how they live, making wise decisions (5:15). In addition, Paul sets forth specific instructions in the household codes of 5:22–6:9, instructing wives, husbands, children, fathers, slaves, and masters. Finally, living a holy life is not simply about making war on our own sinful

<span id="page-23-14"></span>nature but also involves a supernatural battle "against the spiritual forces . . . in the heavenly places" (6:12).

### *Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-23-10"></span>Along with Colossians, Ephesians has been recognized as one of the most Christological books of the NT. One of the uniquely Christological aspects of Ephesians is Paul's assertion in 1:9–10 that God has "a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him." Paul sees a divine plan at work in human history that finds its unity and fulfillment in Christ.

<span id="page-23-8"></span><span id="page-23-3"></span><span id="page-23-2"></span><span id="page-23-1"></span><span id="page-23-0"></span>Because Christ conquered death by his resurrection and exaltation, so too believers are not only made alive by God's grace, adopted into God's family, and redeemed from their sin; they are also raised spiritually and seated with Christ in the heavenly places. The blessings Christians enjoy in Christ that are described in 1:3–14 are similar to the blessings Israel enjoyed in the OT. Israel enjoyed the blessing of being chosen (Gen. 12:1–3; Deut. 7:6–8; 14:2), loved (Deut. 7:8; 33:12; Isa. 5:1; Jer. 11:15), adopted (Ex. 4:22; Isa. 1:2; Hos. 11:1; Rom. 9:4), redeemed (Deut. 7:8; 9:26; 15:5; 1 Chron. 17:21), given an inheritance (Num. 26:55–56; Deut. 3:28; Josh. 11:23), and promised the Holy Spirit (Isa. 44:3; Ezek. 11:19; 36:26–27; 37:14; Joel 2:28–29). Just as Israel was set apart to God and called to walk blamelessly (Pss. 15:2; 18:23), so also believers are called to live "holy and blameless before him" (Eph. 1:4). In addition, Paul emphasizes the radical new unity of Jews and Gentiles. God revealed to him an amazing mystery, which "is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel" (Eph. 3:6). The OT spoke of Gentiles as well as Jews worshiping Yahweh, but Paul goes further, declaring that Jews and Gentiles actual become "one new man in place of the two" (Eph. 2:15).

<span id="page-23-15"></span><span id="page-23-12"></span><span id="page-23-11"></span><span id="page-23-9"></span><span id="page-23-7"></span><span id="page-23-5"></span><span id="page-23-4"></span>As mentioned above, Ephesians has many similarities to Colossians. In fact, roughly one-fourth of the wording in Colossians is found in Ephesians (e.g., cf. Eph. 6:21–22 with Col. 4:7–8). The simplest and most reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that Paul authored both letters at roughly the same time to similar audiences. There are several reasons for understanding the similarities in this way. First, the letter claims to be written by the apostle Paul (Eph. 1:1; 3:1; cf. 3:13). Second, Pauline authorship was unanimously embraced by the early church. Third, the theology of Ephesians, though not always identical, is completely compatible with Paul's other letters. Differences between Ephesians and Colossians most likely result from the different purposes involved in writing the letters.

Many portions of Ephesians also mirror the teachings found elsewhere in Paul's writings and in the rest of the NT. For example, the focus on Christ's resurrection, exaltation, and enthronement is quite common to the rest of the NT.5 In addition, household codes such as those in Ephesians (5:22–6:9) are also found in Colossians 3:18–4:1, 1 Timothy 5:1–6:2, and 1 Peter 2:18–3:7.

<span id="page-23-17"></span><span id="page-23-16"></span><span id="page-23-13"></span><span id="page-23-6"></span><sup>5</sup> See Acts 2:24–36; 3:15–16, 21, 26; 23:6; 24:14–15; 26:23; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3–28; Philippians 2:9–11; Hebrews 1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2; 1 Peter 3:22; Revelation 3:21.

### *Preaching from Ephesians*

The book of Ephesians has a long history of influence in the life of the church.6 As a result, it is not surprising that Ephesians is commonly preached in local churches. The book features many issues that were relevant not only in Paul's day and to Paul's audience but to ours as well. Issues such as God's sovereignty, race relations, roles in marriage and the family, the nature of the church, and spiritual warfare are woven throughout the letter.

<span id="page-24-0"></span>Because there is so much theology and relevant practical material in Ephesians, many pastors often preach slowly through this book (spanning six months to a year). While such a practice is warranted, it does present a corresponding challenge related to the structure of the book, which focuses on theology in the first half (chs. 1–3) and practical application in the second (chs. 4–6). While preaching the second half of Ephesians, there is the danger of forgetting to ground the imperatives (commands) in the finished work of Christ. Goldsworthy offers a good reminder when he says, "Every sermon should be understandable on its own as a proclamation of Christ."7

### *Interpretive Challenges*

#### AUTHORSHIP

<span id="page-24-8"></span><span id="page-24-5"></span><span id="page-24-4"></span><span id="page-24-3"></span><span id="page-24-1"></span>Although the author identifies himself as "Paul" (Eph. 1:1; 3:1), this selfidentification has been vigorously debated in modern scholarship, for several reasons: (1) the letter's impersonal tone (1:13; 1:15–16; 3:2; 4:21) and lack of personal greeting; (2) the letter's language and style (1:3–14, 15–23; 2:1–7; 3:1–13; 4:11–16; 6:14–20); (3) the letter's similarity to Colossians; (4) the letter's theological emphases (its relatively "high" or "cosmic" Christology [1:3, 9–10, 20–23; 2:5–6], its more developed ecclesiology [1:22; 3:10, 21; 5:23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32], and its lack of reference to the *parousia* [or second "coming"] of Christ or the "day of the Lord"); and (5) the common practice of pseudonymity (writing a letter in someone else's name).

<span id="page-24-7"></span><span id="page-24-6"></span><span id="page-24-2"></span>These arguments, however, can be adequately addressed. (1) The letter's impersonal tone makes sense if the letter was written not only to Ephesus but also as a circular letter (cf. comment on 1:1b). In addition, the author does include some personal details (1:15–16; 3:1; 4:1; 6:19–20). (2) The letter's language and style differs at points with some other Pauline letters, but a statistical study of vocabulary is not reliable based on the size of the Pauline corpus. Additionally, Paul elsewhere writes with long sentences, even if Ephesians has a greater number of them. (3) The letter's similarity to Colossians in no way indicates that Colossians was a source for Ephesians but rather indicates that Paul probably wrote the two letters around the same time to Christians experiencing similar circumstances. (4) The letter's theological emphases have been somewhat exaggerated by many critics. Although it is true that the resurrection and exaltation of Christ is stressed, the

<sup>7</sup> Graeme Goldsworthy, *Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture* (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000), 237.

<span id="page-25-5"></span><span id="page-25-3"></span><span id="page-25-2"></span>author does not ignore the death and cross of Christ (1:7; 2:13, 16; 5:2, 25). The letter's ecclesiology does highlight the universal (rather than the local) church, but this distinction is often overstated and simplistic. And, there are several references in the letter to the future aspect of eschatology (1:10, 13–14, 18; 4:30; 5:5, 6, 27; 6:10–20). (5) Although pseudonymous letters existed in the first century, it is clear that such letters, if they were discovered to be pseudonymous, were rejected by both Jewish and Christian communities.

#### RECIPIENTS

<span id="page-25-0"></span>The precise location to which Paul sent this letter is debated because some manuscripts include the phrase "in Ephesus" (1:1) while others do not. Factors favoring the omission of this phrase include the general content and impersonal tone as well as the lack of any personal greetings in the letter. These reasons suggest the letter was not written to any one specific location; it may have been intended as a circular letter and not merely for the Christians in Ephesians.

There are, however, compelling reasons for seeing "in Ephesus" as authentic. Not only is this addition found in a diversity of manuscript traditions, but also it makes the syntax of the Greek awkward (making it more likely that the phrase was removed in some manuscripts than that it was added to others). The general content and impersonal tone of the letter could have been necessary for multiple reasons: (1) about five years had passed since Paul last visited the church at Ephesus, which would have allowed for numerous new converts unknown to Paul to join the church; (2) the letter could have been sent to several house churches scattered throughout the city as well as to some located outside the city in the surrounding area. Additionally, there are also no personal greetings in 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, or Philippians.

#### WRITING STYLE

<span id="page-25-4"></span><span id="page-25-1"></span>As Paul writes this letter, he often employs long sentences (1:3–14, 15–23; 2:1–7; 3:1–7; 4:11–16; 6:14–20). Such sentences can make it difficult to follow Paul's train of thought and isolate his main ideas. Of course, these sentences may not appear as long in English versions, but the reader is still tasked with the duty of discerning Paul's central point. Paul's sentences are complex, often with many prepositional phrases. Most of these prepositional phrases are adverbial (that is, modifying a verb and not a noun or pronoun), but it is not always clear which verb these phrases modify.

### EPHESIANS 1:1–2

1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful*<sup>1</sup>* in Christ Jesus: **<sup>2</sup>**Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

1Some manuscripts *saints who are also faithful* (omitting *in Ephesus*)

### *Section Overview*

The opening two verses form a greeting or salutation in a somewhat typical ancient style: an identification of the sender and recipient and then a greeting. Paul normally expands each of these components so that his introductory greetings are lengthier than what was typical. In this case, he identifies the divine source of his authority ("the will of God"; v. 1), further describes his readers ("the saints . . . faithful in Christ Jesus"; v. 1), and offers the divine source of his prayer of blessing ("from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"; v. 2).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-28-3"></span><span id="page-28-1"></span><span id="page-28-0"></span>1:1a Paul identifies himself as the sole author of this letter, which is true also of Romans and the Pastoral Epistles. He uses "apostle" in its technical sense, which refers specifically to the Twelve (Matt. 10:2; Acts 1:13; 1 Cor. 15:5, 7) and himself (1 Cor. 9:1; 15:9), who were chosen and commissioned by Jesus to a unique position in the founding of the church. The qualifying phrase "of Christ Jesus" indicates relationship: Paul is an apostle who belongs to Jesus Christ. Furthermore, his apostleship is "by the will of God," which expresses the means by which Paul was chosen and commissioned as an apostle. The same opening phrase is found in 2 Corinthians 1:1, Colossians 1:1, and 2 Timothy 1:1.

<span id="page-29-6"></span><span id="page-29-3"></span><span id="page-29-2"></span>1:1b Paul next identifies his recipients. First, he designates them as "saints" (cf. Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:2). Second, he refers to them as "faithful" (or "believing") in Christ Jesus, indicating their positive response to the gospel message. Third, these believing saints are located in the city of Ephesus, although some of the earliest manuscripts do not include this location. For this reason, many take "in Ephesus" to be a later (but still accurate) addition, since Ephesus was probably the first or primary location to which the letter was sent (cf. Introduction: Interpretive Challenges).

<span id="page-29-8"></span><span id="page-29-1"></span><span id="page-29-0"></span>1:2 The third element in the introduction is the greeting. This particular greeting is a favorite of Paul's, with its exact formula (i.e., the entire verse) found in seven other letters as well (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Phil. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:2; and Philem. 3). The customary Hellenistic or Greek style was simply "greetings" (a form of the word "grace"; cf. Acts 15:23; 23:26; James 1:1), and the traditional Jewish style was "peace." Paul's greeting is distinctively Christian and combines both elements. "Grace" and "peace" are major themes in this letter, occurring twelve times (Eph. 1:2, 6, 7; 2:5, 7, 8; 3:2, 7, 8; 4:7, 29; 6:24) and eight times (1:2; 2:14, 15, 17 [2x]; 4:3; 6:15, 23), respectively. Paul indicates the origin or source of grace and peace in the Christian life as "God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

### <span id="page-29-5"></span><span id="page-29-4"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-29-7"></span>Paul writes this letter in accordance with the authority he received as an apostle of Christ Jesus. His apostleship signifies not only that he belongs to Christ but also that he is fully authorized as Christ's messenger to proclaim the good news of the one who sent him. Paul's calling to reach the Gentiles with the gospel is not something he gave himself but is something to which he was called by the sovereign plan of God. In fact, prior to his call, Paul was striving to find and arrest Christians proclaiming that Jesus was the Messiah. It was "by the will of God" that Paul received his apostleship. This phrase reminds us that it was God's unmerited favor and grace that saved Paul and called him to serve. He received his position not through his own personal accomplishments or good works but through God's gracious plan (cf. 1 Tim. 1:15–16), and the same is true for us. Thus, although Paul received a unique calling as an apostle, the mercy he received is an example for us as we remember that God chose us not because of something desirable in us but because of his love and grace found in Christ Jesus.

In the original Greek this section (1:3–14) consists of one long sentence (202 words). Structurally, this blessing precedes the thanksgiving section that is typical of most of Paul's epistles (e.g., 2 Cor. 1:3–7). The phrases "in Christ," "in him," or "in the beloved" occur eleven times in the Greek (ten times in the ESV). Several other elements are also emphasized: (1) the threefold repetition of God's purpose (Eph. 1:5, 9, 11); (2) the threefold repetition of "to the praise of his glory" (vv. 6, 12, 14), demonstrating the significance of each member of the Trinity (God the Father [vv. 3–6], Son [vv. 7–12], and Spirit [vv. 13–14]); and (3) four key verbs that form the basis of praise to God (vv. 4 ["he chose us"], 7 ["we have redemption"], 11 ["we have obtained an inheritance"], 13 ["you . . . were sealed"]). The first of these elements (the threefold repetition of God's purpose; vv. 5, 9, 11), is paralleled by the threefold repetition of "In him" (vv. 7, 11, 13).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-31-3"></span>1:3 Paul begins the body of this letter in a typical OT or Jewish style of a prolonged blessing (*berakah*). The main idea of this section is found in the first word in both the English and Greek text: "blessed" (*eulogētos*). God is to be blessed or praised because of his great grace that provides believers in Jesus Christ a plethora of spiritual blessings (cf. 2 Cor. 1:3; 11:31; 1 Pet. 1:3). Note the emphasis on blessing: "*Blessed* be . . . who has *blessed* us with every spiritual *blessing*." God is described not only as "Father" but also as the one "who has blessed" believers. This latter phrase gives the basis or grounds for blessing God: God is to be blessed (praised) because he is the one who blesses.

<span id="page-31-4"></span>The final section of this verse consists of a series of three prepositional phrases clarifying the nature of God's blessings. First, God has blessed us "in Christ." That is, these blessings are reserved specifically for those who believe in Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension and are united with him through faith. It could be argued that "in Christ" is the most important phrase of this passage (and the entire letter), as it occurs in different forms with the preposition "in" eleven times (Eph. 1:3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 [2x], 11, 12, 13 [2x]). Second, God has blessed us "with every spiritual blessing." Here Paul limits the type of blessing specifically to *spiritual* blessings (i.e., blessings pertaining to life in the Spirit). This phrase is a summary of everything Christians receive through God's work in his Son, including election, adoption, redemption, forgiveness, and the gift of the Spirit. Third, God has blessed us "in the heavenly places" (lit., "in the heavenlies"), a phrase found only in Ephesians (1:3, 20; 2:6; 3:10; 6:12). Because our blessings are "in Christ," they are also in the heavenly places, where Christ is now ruling. And yet, the benefits Christ secured are available to his children here and now (though not fully). This verse serves as a summary statement for the entire section.

<span id="page-31-6"></span><span id="page-31-5"></span><span id="page-31-1"></span><span id="page-31-0"></span>1:4 Paul provides the first of four main reasons believers are to praise God: because he chose us. God's election is a theme throughout the Bible (Gen. 12:1–3; Deut. 7:6–8; 14:2). In Christ, God chooses a people for himself. Although a corporate element is present, it would be inaccurate to claim that individuals are not in view.

<span id="page-31-2"></span>This election is said to take place "before the foundation of the world" (cf. John 17:24; 1 Pet. 1:20). That is, God's choice in election occurred before time and creation, emphasizing that this choice was based on God's sovereign purpose, not human merits. Thus the appropriate response is to praise God for such blessing.

<span id="page-32-11"></span>God's election, however, is not without an end goal. Paul continues by saying that the purpose of those chosen by God is "that we should be holy and blameless before him" (cf. Col. 1:22). With the privilege of election comes the responsibility of living according to God's Word. God desires not only to forgive our sins but also to conform us to the image of his beloved Son (Rom. 8:29–30). "Before him" most likely means before Jesus, specifically referring to the day of our Lord Jesus when we will appear before him in judgment.

<span id="page-32-2"></span>The last phrase, "in love," could modify either the previous statement ("that we should be holy and blameless before him in love") or what follows ("in love he predestined us"). Although some English versions favor the former (CSB, KJV, NKJV, NRSV), the latter interpretation is preferable (ESV, NASB, NIV) since the focus of this section is on God's work of blessing his people.

<span id="page-32-6"></span><span id="page-32-0"></span>1:5–6 The act of God's choosing (v. 4) is now expanded and emphasized in these verses. God's choice of his people is related to their being *predestined* (or "foreordained" or "predetermined") to be a part of his family and thus receive all the accompanying benefits. But predestination is not an end in itself. Rather, God's divine purpose of predestination is that those chosen are adopted into his family through the finished work of Christ. In the OT, the nation of Israel was given this special privilege (Ex. 4:22; Hos. 11:1; Rom. 9:4). Adoption was quite common in Greco-Roman culture. Adoptees were given the full status of the family and became heirs of the family's estate. Paul now applies this concept to believers (cf. Rom. 9:26; 2 Cor. 6:18). The term "adoption" is used only five times in the NT, and only by Paul (cf. Rom. 8:15, 23; 9:4; Gal. 4:5). Those who were once "sons of disobedience" (Eph. 2:2) and "children of wrath" (2:3) are now able to call God their Father. The realization of this intimate relationship is possible only "through Jesus Christ" (1:5); he alone provides access to the Father, because of his finished work on the cross.

<span id="page-32-10"></span><span id="page-32-5"></span><span id="page-32-4"></span><span id="page-32-3"></span><span id="page-32-1"></span>God's work of predestination was done "according to the purpose of his will" (v. 5). It was done in accordance with his "purpose," indicating that the choosing of his people was something in which God delighted. And it was done in accordance with his "will." God has a definite plan and redemptive purpose for adopting wayward sinners into his family.

<span id="page-32-7"></span>God's gracious act of predestination and adoption was done so that his redeemed children might praise his glorious grace (v. 6; cf. vv. 12, 14). God's grace is glorious as it reflects his character and is therefore worthy of our highest praise. Paul further notes that God has "blessed" us with this grace. This verb highlights the abundant kindness of God in freely granting salvation to those who did not deserve it. This grace comes to us "in the Beloved," that is, "in Christ."

<span id="page-32-9"></span><span id="page-32-8"></span>1:7–8 Paul now offers the second of four main reasons why God is worthy of the praises of his people: because he redeems us. Paul moves from God's predetermining choice before time to his work of redemption in the course of history. This verse is structurally parallel to verses 11 and 13, as each begins with "In him." The redemption believers have is "in him," that is, "in the Beloved" (v. 6). The Greek word translated "redemption" indicates release or liberation from imprisonment or captivity. It occurs 10 times in the NT, seven of those times in Paul's writings (cf. Rom. 3:24; 8:23; 1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 1:14; 4:30; Col. 1:14; cf. also Heb. 9:15; 11:35).

<span id="page-33-2"></span><span id="page-33-1"></span><span id="page-33-0"></span>The concept of redemption is found also in the OT, where it describes both the release of slaves from bondage (Ex. 21:8; Lev. 25:48) and the deliverance of God's people from slavery in Egypt (Deut. 7:8; 9:26; 13:5; 1 Chron. 17:21). In verse 7 Paul specifically indicates that our redemption in Christ is "through his blood"; the *means* by which redemption is procured is the sacrificial death of Jesus.

<span id="page-33-10"></span>The redemption believers receive is then equated with "the forgiveness of our trespasses." Forgiveness implies an offense requiring just punishment. Here, Paul uses "trespasses" instead of the more common word "sins," though the parallel passage in Colossians 1:14 uses "sins." The believer's redemption is presented as the fulfillment of a "new exodus" prophesied in the OT. In other words, the redemption Christians receive is the fulfillment of what was typified when Israel was redeemed from Egypt. And just as Israel's exodus from Egypt was accompanied by the institution of the Levitical system so that Israel could atone for their sins, so also the believer's redemption in Christ from sin is accompanied by full and final forgiveness.

<span id="page-33-7"></span><span id="page-33-6"></span>Behind God's work of redemption is his grace ("according to the riches of his grace"; Eph. 1:7). In verse 6 Paul spoke of God's "glorious grace," and now he picks up the topic of grace once more, this time referring to the wealth or abundance of God's grace (cf. 1:18; 3:8, 16; cf. Col. 1:27; 2:2–3). Ephesians 1:8 expands upon the "grace" mentioned in verse 7 by indicating that God has "lavished" this grace upon his people, further elaborating the extent of God's grace. Paul then adds that the manner in which God bestows his grace is "in all wisdom and insight." God did not lavish his grace on his people in an ill-conceived or haphazard manner.

<span id="page-33-8"></span><span id="page-33-4"></span>1:9 The plan of God to accomplish redemption through his Son is no longer a mystery. It was God's design all along for his people to understand his purposes, but some of the details of his plan were not disclosed. In the gospel, however, God has revealed his divine mystery, which involves uniting all things in Christ. Verse 9 is best understood as stating the *means* by which God made his purposes known ("*by* making known to us"). "Making known" is often used in connection with God's unveiling of his revelation (Rom. 16:26; Eph. 3:3, 5, 10; Col. 1:27). "Mystery" in Paul's writings refers to something once hidden but now disclosed, especially as it relates to God's plan to unite all things (including Jews and Gentiles) into the one body of Christ (Rom. 11:25; 16:25–27; Eph. 3:3, 4, 9; Col. 1:26–27; 1 Tim. 3:16). The term occurs twenty-eight times in the NT, twenty-one of those times in Paul's writings, including six times in Ephesians (1:9; 3:3, 4, 9; 5:32; 6:19).

<span id="page-33-9"></span><span id="page-33-5"></span><span id="page-33-3"></span>Just as God's choice to predestine believers for adoption was "according to the purpose of his will" (1:5), so, too, his design to reveal his redemptive plan is "according to his purpose." Specifically, God's plan was set forth in his Son. That is, Christ was intimately involved with the Father in planning redemption.

<span id="page-34-10"></span><span id="page-34-6"></span><span id="page-34-1"></span>1:10 God set forth his plan not only "in Christ" but also "as a plan for the fullness of time," communicating his divine purpose. The term translated "plan" (*oikonomia*) occurs eight other times in the NT (Luke 16:2, 3, 4; 1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 3:2, 9; Col. 1:25; 1 Tim. 1:4) and can have three different meanings: (1) the act of administrating; (2) that which is administered (i.e., a plan); or (3) the office (or role) of an administrator.

<span id="page-34-11"></span><span id="page-34-3"></span>God's perfect plan was "to unite all things" through his Son. This phrase describes the content of the mystery hidden in the past but now revealed in the gospel. The only other NT use of the verb "to unite" is in Romans 13:9, where Paul notes that all of the OT commandments can be "summed up" by the command to love your neighbor as yourself. "All things" refers to the entire universe (cf. Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16, 20). This is confirmed when Paul amplifies this thought by adding, "things in heaven and things on earth." Finally, all of God's purposes will be accomplished "in him," that is, "in Christ." Christ is not only the means by which God will unite all the disparate elements of creation; he is also the center and focal point through whom and for whom this will take place. The election and predestination of Israel as God's firstborn son pointed forward to Christ, the elect one, God's Son, just as the redemption of Israel from Egypt pointed forward to his cross. It is only in Christ that believers enjoy the blessings described in this section.

<span id="page-34-7"></span><span id="page-34-5"></span>1:11 In verses 11–12, Paul provides the third of four reasons believers should praise God: because he has given us an imperishable inheritance. The repetition of "In him" (i.e., Christ) indicates that this section of the eulogy is structurally parallel to verses 7 and 13. It is through our union with Christ that believers are incorporated into the family of God and have become heirs to the blessings and promises made by the Father (cf. Rom. 8:17; Gal. 3:29; 4:1, 5, 7).

<span id="page-34-2"></span>The verb translated "we have obtained an inheritance" (*klēroō*) can also mean to "appoint by lot" and occurs only here in the NT.8 In light of the latter definition, some interpret the phrase to mean, "we have been allotted to God as his inheritance" or "we were claimed by God as his portion." With this interpretation, believers are not receiving an inheritance but *are* the inheritance that God receives. While the concept of God's possessing his people as an inheritance is found in the OT (e.g., Deut. 4:20; 9:29; 32:8–9; 1 Kings 8:51; Pss. 33:12; 106:40), it does not fit the tenor of the context of Ephesians 1:11–12, which emphasizes the blessing (i.e., inheritance) believers receive. The theme of believers receiving an inheritance is mentioned also in verses 5, 14, and 18.

<span id="page-34-9"></span><span id="page-34-8"></span><span id="page-34-0"></span>Paul further assures the Ephesian believers of their inheritance (which is both present and future) by reminding them again that God has predestined them to possess it. Just as believers were predestined for adoption "according to the purpose of his will" (1:5), so here they are predestined to receive an inheritance "according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will." The

<span id="page-34-4"></span><sup>8</sup> The noun form of this term (*klēros*) is often used in the Greek OT to refer to the apportioning of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. Here Paul indicates that believers are given an inheritance, demonstrating the fulfillment of the initial promise to Israel.

<span id="page-35-11"></span><span id="page-35-3"></span>comfort to believers is that, while we were sinners and his enemies (Rom. 5:8–10), God delighted to choose a people for himself. That salvation is God's initiative is nothing but good news. This was not a reckless and ill-conceived plan but was done according to his *purpose* (cf. Eph. 3:11), *counsel*, and *will*. It was a carefully considered plan carried out by his sovereign control of the universe.

<span id="page-35-8"></span><span id="page-35-6"></span>1:12 Here we see the divine purpose for why believers are predestined to receive an inheritance: that they might praise God's glory (cf. vv. 6, 14). Paul further describes the "we" who are chosen for the purpose of praising God's glory by adding "who were the first to hope in Christ." The Greek verb underlying this phrase, which occurs only here in the NT, can refer either to Jewish believers or, generically, to all believers.

God's glory is the revelation and manifestation of who he is: his essence, power, majesty, purity, and holiness. Therefore, to praise God for his glory is to declare that he is the one true God, who made heaven and earth.

<span id="page-35-9"></span><span id="page-35-7"></span>1:13 Paul now highlights the final reason why God is worthy of the praises of his people: he has sealed them with his Holy Spirit. The repetition of "In him" indicates that this section is structurally parallel to verses 7 and 11. The main thrust of verses 13–14 is, "You were sealed with the Holy Spirit." Paul again reminds his readers to bless God because of the gift of the Holy Spirit, who not only indwells his people but also is the means by which they are sealed so as to guarantee that they will receive their promised inheritance.

<span id="page-35-1"></span><span id="page-35-0"></span>The Holy Spirit is described as "promised." The Spirit was promised to the people of Israel in the OT (Isa. 32:15; 44:3; Ezek. 11:19; 36:26–27; 37:14; Joel 2:28–29; cf. Acts 1:4; 2:33; Gal. 3:14) and is the means ("with") by which God seals his people. Paul also indicates that their sealing with the Spirit took place "when [they] heard the word of truth." In contrast to the many false gospels, Paul speaks of the word he preached as being "the word of truth" (cf. Gal. 2:5, 14; Col. 1:5). He further describes his message as "the gospel of your salvation." That is, it is the good news that saves one from the impending wrath of God (cf. Rom. 1:18).

<span id="page-35-10"></span><span id="page-35-5"></span><span id="page-35-2"></span>The result of hearing and believing was that the Ephesian Christians "were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit." When they heard the gospel and believed it, they were immediately sealed with the Holy Spirit. These three actions occurred simultaneously. "Sealed" is the main verb in this section (Eph. 1:13–14) and is a divine passive (passive voice with the implied subject being God; i.e., they were sealed by God). This verb can be used to convey at least four ideas: (1) security; (2) authentication; (3) genuineness; and (4) identification of ownership (cf. 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22). The last option seems most appropriate in this context: God is to be blessed because he seals believers with his Spirit, claiming them as his own and securing their eschatological inheritance.

<span id="page-35-12"></span><span id="page-35-4"></span>1:14 Paul further elaborates on the person of the Holy Spirit by reminding his readers that the Spirit "is the guarantee of our inheritance." "Guarantee" is used only three times in the NT, each by Paul in reference to the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. <span id="page-36-1"></span><span id="page-36-0"></span>1:22; 5:5; cf. Rom. 8:23). In the ancient world, a "guarantee" (*arrabōn*) functioned as a down payment given to someone providing a service with the expectation that full payment would be made after the service was performed. Once the *arrabōn* was accepted, a person was committed to fulfilling the terms of the contract. Similarly, God has given his people the Holy Spirit with the expectation and assurance that a full inheritance will follow (cf. 2 Cor. 5:5). That is, the presence of God's Spirit will not be undone but will endure "until we acquire possession of it" (Eph. 1:14; cf. 4:30). Although the inheritance believers will receive certainly includes the blessing of eternal fellowship with God, because the Spirit indwells believers they can even now begin to enjoy their inheritance.

<span id="page-36-10"></span><span id="page-36-5"></span><span id="page-36-3"></span>Again, the result of God's favor on his people that includes sealing with the Holy Spirit should lead to praise: "to the praise of his glory" (cf. 1:6, 12). This final expression of praise concludes not only the fourth and final section but also the entire eulogy as a whole (vv. 3–14). Thus the eulogy not only began with blessing and praise; it ends in the same way.

### *Response*

While meditating on God's grace, Paul erupts with praises to his God. Paul is not merely saying that God is worthy of our praise. Rather, he is actually praising God for his glorious salvation—and in so doing he is inviting his readers to do the same. This passage is indeed a great example for us. We should often contemplate the wonders of God's grace and his amazing plan of salvation in Jesus Christ (cf. Heb. 2:3). We have a great salvation because we have a great God. As we contemplate the many blessings we have in Christ, we should respond with appropriate praise to God.

<span id="page-36-11"></span><span id="page-36-9"></span><span id="page-36-6"></span><span id="page-36-2"></span>The Trinitarian focus of this doxology is immediately evident. First, it is God the Father who is to be praised for his marvelous salvation. He is described as "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Eph. 1:3), who chose us (v. 4), predestined us (vv. 5, 11), adopted us (vv. 5, 11, 14), redeemed us (v. 7), forgave us (vv. 7–8), and sealed us by his Spirit (v. 13). These blessings given to his people were part of his sovereign plan before the foundation of the world (v. 4). The Father works all things according to his "purpose" (vv. 5, 9, 11), "will" (vv. 5, 9, 11), and "plan" (v. 10), and all things are done "to the praise of his glory" (vv. 6, 12, 14).

<span id="page-36-7"></span>This introductory eulogy is also Christ-centered, focusing on the unique work of the Son. The salvation Christians possess is deeply anchored in the finished work of Jesus. This emphasis is borne out by Paul's use in this passage of the phrase "in Christ" (or its equivalent) eleven times in Greek (nine times in the ESV).9 Every spiritual blessing we possess is due to our relationship and union with Christ (v. 3). Specifically, we are chosen "in him" (v. 4), predestined in him (v. 5), blessed "in the Beloved" (v. 6), redeemed "in him" (v. 7), united "in him" (v. 10), granted an inheritance "in him" (v. 11), and sealed with the Spirit "in him" (v. 13).

<span id="page-36-8"></span><span id="page-36-4"></span><sup>9</sup> "In Christ" occurs 164 times in Paul's 13 letters, with 36 of those occurrences in Ephesians.

<span id="page-37-1"></span><span id="page-37-0"></span>Finally, the work and ministry of the Spirit is clearly seen in this passage. We are blessed with every "spiritual" blessing in the heavenly places (v. 3). That is, we are given every blessing that relates to or belongs to God's Spirit. Thus, all the blessings mentioned in this passage are gifts given by the Holy Spirit. In addition, those who have faith in Christ are "sealed with the . . . Holy Spirit" (v. 13). This primarily indicates that the Holy Spirit is the means by which we are sealed, demonstrating we belong to God. And yet, the Spirit is also the down payment or deposit guaranteeing God's future blessings to believers. The triune God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—is infinitely worthy of our praise.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-37-5"></span><span id="page-37-4"></span><span id="page-37-3"></span>Paul moves from blessing God to offering thanksgiving and prayer for his audience (cf. Phil. 1:3–11; Col. 1:3–14; Philem. 4–6). Like the previous section, this section also comprises one long sentence (169 words) in the Greek. The key idea is found in verse 16, where Paul unceasingly gives thanks and prays for the Ephesian Christians. This key thought is followed by two content clauses in verse 17 ("that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation") and verse 18 ("that you may know . . ."). The second of these two purposes is further expanded with three demonstrative pronoun phrases ("*what* is the hope to which he has called you, *what* are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and *what* is the immeasurable greatness of his power"; vv. 18–19). Paul then further elaborates on this final point by offering four ways in which God's mighty

<span id="page-38-8"></span>power is displayed through his Son (vv. 20–23). He begins with thanksgiving and prayer but moves to lofty statements of Jesus' exalted position in the universe, which, as the length of material devoted to this latter topic indicates (vv. 20–23), is being emphasized by the apostle.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-38-9"></span><span id="page-38-4"></span><span id="page-38-3"></span><span id="page-38-2"></span>1:15–16a Paul now offers thanks for the faith and love of his readers. "For this reason" points back to the entire preceding eulogy of verses 3–14, perhaps especially to verses 13–14, and provides a reason for why Paul gives thanks and prays for the Ephesian believers (cf. 5:17; 6:13, where the same Greek phrase is also used). In 1:16 Paul provides the main thought of this section when he says that he unceasingly gives thanks and prays for his readers. This verse involves two separate, though related, actions. The first is that Paul is thankful for the Ephesian believers. It would be easy to misinterpret Paul's first statement ("I do not cease to give thanks for you") to mean that he is always (whenever he is awake) thanking God for them. In fact, his giving thanks is related to his prayers. That is, whenever he prays, he is in the habit of thanking God for the faith and love of the Ephesians.

<span id="page-38-10"></span><span id="page-38-0"></span>Paul specifically gives thanks "because" he heard of their (1) "faith in the Lord" and (2) "love toward all the saints" (cf. Col. 1:3–4). First, Paul is thankful for their faith. Although they lived in a hostile environment where Christianity was marginalized and Christians suffered persecution (cf. Acts 19:21–41), they held firmly to their faith. Notice this is not a blind faith but a specific faith "in the Lord Jesus." The Ephesian Christians did not confess the god Artemis (Diana) or even Caesar as Lord. Rather, their Lord was Jesus. Their faith was not simply an intellectual affirmation of Christian belief about Jesus but was, more importantly, an intimate union with Jesus, who provided them with grace and strength to survive and thrive in the world. Second, Paul is thankful for the love the Ephesian believers possessed "toward all the saints." "Saints" refers to all believers, who have been "sanctified" or "made holy" by the redemption found in Christ (cf. Eph. 1:1, 18).

<span id="page-38-7"></span><span id="page-38-6"></span><span id="page-38-5"></span><span id="page-38-1"></span>1:16b–17 In the second half of verse 16, Paul transitions from thanksgiving to intercession. The content of Paul's prayer begins in verse 17, but not before he <span id="page-39-6"></span>includes a twofold description of the one who is the source of all divine blessings. First, the one to whom Paul prays is acknowledged as "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ." Similar to his eulogy in 1:3, Paul links blessings from God to his Son Jesus Christ, demonstrating the centrality of the Son in the Father's purposes. Second, he addresses God as "the Father of glory." Elsewhere God is referred to as "the God of glory" (Ps. 29:3; Acts 7:2), "the Lord of glory" (1 Cor. 2:8; James 2:1), and "the King of glory" (Ps. 24:7–10).

<span id="page-39-9"></span><span id="page-39-3"></span><span id="page-39-2"></span><span id="page-39-1"></span>Paul asks that God would give the Ephesian believers "the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation" (Eph. 1:17; cf. Isa. 11:2). Although it is possible to take "spirit" as a reference to human disposition, it is best to interpret this usage as a reference to the Holy Spirit, who imparts both wisdom and revelation (so ESV). Although all believers are already sealed with the Spirit (Eph. 1:13), there is still a need for them to be filled with the Spirit and walk according to him. Specifically, Paul prays that the work of the Spirit would produce wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God. Paul often prays for his readers to grow in the knowledge of God (Phil. 1:9; Col. 1:9–10; Philem. 6); this knowledge is not some mere esoteric insight but is the type of intimate knowledge that family members possess.

<span id="page-39-16"></span><span id="page-39-14"></span><span id="page-39-13"></span><span id="page-39-0"></span>Paul continues his intercessory prayer by requesting that God would grant his readers spiritual insight. Paul uses the phrase "the eyes of your hearts" to refer to believers' capacity to discern spiritual realities related to the purpose and plan of God (cf. Pss. 13:3; 19:8). Before their conversion, Paul's readers were "darkened in their understanding" (Eph. 4:18), but now Paul prays that they would be "enlightened" by God's Spirit in order to comprehend the mysteries of God. To see with one's heart is to perceive not with physical eyes but with the eyes of faith. Paul then prays specifically that the Ephesian saints would comprehend three spiritual realities.

<span id="page-39-17"></span><span id="page-39-15"></span><span id="page-39-10"></span><span id="page-39-8"></span><span id="page-39-5"></span><span id="page-39-4"></span>1:18a Paul's first request is that his audience would know the hope of God's calling. Notice that the text does not read "the hope of *your* calling" (cf. 1 Cor. 1:26; 2 Pet. 1:10). Rather, it is the hope of *his* calling or, as the ESV rightly translates, "the hope to which he has called you." God not only predestined his people (Eph. 1:4–5); he also called them through the preaching of the gospel (Rom. 8:30; 2 Tim. 1:9) and now, in that gospel, extends hope to those who embrace it (Col. 1:5). Before hearing and believing the gospel, Paul's readers had "no hope" and were "without God in the world" (Eph. 2:12). But now, through Christ's work on the cross, those who once had no hope have been called to a sure one. It is Paul's prayer that his readers would come to understand and experience this reality in their lives. In essence, this request is that God would enable them to affirm with confidence all the divine blessings mentioned in 1:3–14.

<span id="page-39-12"></span><span id="page-39-11"></span><span id="page-39-7"></span>1:18b Paul also prays that his readers would comprehend "the riches of his glorious inheritance." Although it is possible to see the inheritance as God's possession of his people (a concept found in both OT and NT), here it is best to view the inheritance as that which God gives to his people. Just a few verses earlier, Paul had said

<span id="page-40-4"></span>that those who believed the gospel were sealed with the Holy Spirit, "who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it" (v. 14; cf. Col. 1:12).

<span id="page-40-10"></span><span id="page-40-8"></span><span id="page-40-5"></span><span id="page-40-0"></span>1:19 Paul's third request is for the Ephesians to know the greatness of God's power, the very same power that raised Jesus, seated him at God's side, and gave him authority over all things. This request is expanded in verses 20–23, emphasizing that it is especially important to Paul. Such power is needed as God's people engage in ongoing spiritual warfare (6:10–12; cf. 3:7, 16, 20). The "power" of God is stressed as Paul describes it as possessing "immeasurable greatness." But Paul does not stop there: he further says that this power is "according to the working of his great might." *Power*, *working*, *strength* (translated "great"), and *might* are piled up to provoke confidence in God and his plan (cf. Deut. 3:24; Isa. 40:26). Finally, all of God's power has been directed "toward us who believe." This news would have been especially encouraging to the letter's original recipients. Because Ephesus was steeped in magical practices and the cult of Artemis, Paul reassures his readers of the supremacy of God's power. His readers need not fear hostile spiritual powers, because the power of God is far greater. This power was displayed preeminently in Christ.

<span id="page-40-7"></span><span id="page-40-6"></span>1:20a Although Paul's prayer continues, his requests do not. Instead, he focuses on God's power magnificently demonstrated in Christ. The final request Paul mentions is for his readers to know the immeasurable greatness of God's power. This power is "according to the *working* of his great might that he *worked* in Christ" (vv. 19b–20a). Verses 20–23 beautifully illustrate the mighty *works* of God accomplished in his Son, specifically his (1) resurrection, (2) exaltation, (3) conquest, and (4) domination.

The first mighty work of God was raising Christ from the dead. The resurrection of Jesus represents the pinnacle of God's work in salvation history. Although others in the Bible were raised from the dead, the raising of Jesus is significantly different because only Jesus conquered the Devil and sin. The resurrection of Jesus was the focus of early preaching (Acts 2:23–24; 17:18; 1 Cor. 15:3–4) and is at the very center of God's plan to redeem his people.

<span id="page-40-9"></span><span id="page-40-3"></span><span id="page-40-2"></span>1:20b–21 The second illustration of God's power is the exaltation of Jesus to the right hand of the Father. Forty days after his resurrection, Jesus was taken up into heaven (Acts 1:9). Paul's reference to Christ's exaltation is significant for at least three reasons.

First, Christ is *seated*, which signifies lordship. The place where Jesus is sitting is not some ordinary *chair* but a *throne*, which implies that he is currently reigning as the sovereign king of the universe. Whereas the resurrection proclaims that he *lives* forever, his exaltation proclaims that he *reigns* forever. In addition, his being seated indicates the completion of his earthly mission.

<span id="page-40-1"></span>Second, Christ is seated *at God's right hand*, which signifies honor and power. When the Bible speaks of Jesus' being seated at the right hand of God, this should not be understood literally. The Bible tell us that "God is spirit" (John 4:24) and <span id="page-41-3"></span><span id="page-41-1"></span>therefore he does not possess a right hand (nor a literal throne on which to sit). "At his right hand" is metaphorical, indicating honor and status (1 Kings 2:19; Rom. 8:34; Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2; 1 Pet. 3:22), as well as power (Ex. 15:6; Ps. 89:13; Isa. 48:13).

<span id="page-41-0"></span>Third, Christ is seated *in the heavenly places*, which signifies prominence. His throne is not merely an earthly throne. Even though there might be other kings, there is no king like him. Indeed, he is the "King of kings and the Lord of lords" (1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 19:16). His throne is over all the spiritual powers in the universe, whether seen or unseen.

<span id="page-41-10"></span><span id="page-41-4"></span>Paul emphasizes Jesus' supremacy by saying that he has been exalted "far above all rule and authority and power and dominion" (Eph. 1:21). Although each of these four terms have distinct nuances, Paul piles them up to convey the comprehensive nature of Jesus' supremacy. In fact, Jesus is exalted "above every name that is named." Finally, in case there is any doubt, Paul adds, "not only in this age but also in the one to come." Christ is not only given a position above all others; he is given that position permanently. Paul's point, then, is that the same power that raised Jesus from the dead and exalted him to the throne at his Father's side in heaven is the power now at work in God's people.

<span id="page-41-11"></span><span id="page-41-5"></span><span id="page-41-2"></span>1:22a The third component Paul mentions to highlight God's mighty power in exalting his Son is that all things have been put in subjection to Christ. Paul essentially quotes Psalm 8:6 ("You have put all things under his feet"; cf. 1 Cor. 15:27; Heb. 2:8). Although Christ's ultimate victory is certain, the final subjugation of all things will not occur until death is defeated and God is all in all. But because of Christ's present enthronement, which guarantees the certainty of future victory, Paul writes as if it were already accomplished (cf. Phil. 3:21; Col. 2:15).

<span id="page-41-9"></span><span id="page-41-8"></span><span id="page-41-6"></span>1:22b–23 The final example of God's power displayed in Christ involves his headship over the church. God made Christ head "over all things," which denotes his supremacy over all of creation, particularly the hostile spiritual powers previously referenced (v. 21; cf. Col. 2:10). In addition, Christ's headship extends to the church. "Head" refers to one who is of supreme rank or preeminent status and possesses ruling authority. Thus, God's power in Christ not only has resulted in the sure defeat of his enemies but also is for the good of believers as the promised Messiah graciously rules his church. Although Paul typically uses *ekklēsia* to refer to the local gathering of believers, here it refers to the universal church (cf. Eph. 3:10, 21; 5:23–25, 27, 29, 32; Col. 1:18, 24). Paul concludes by again noting that God's gift of Christ as head over all creation is for the benefit of the church. So, his prayer is that his readers would comprehend and apprehend the amazing power of God that he works for their advantage.

<span id="page-41-7"></span>Paul switches from the metaphor of Christ's being head over all things, including the church, to the church's being the body of Christ. This metaphor is used here to describe the relationship not of believers to each other but of Christ to his people. He is the sovereign Lord who fills all things in every respect.

### *Response*

Paul not only encouraged others to give thanks to God for all things, including working in the lives of his fellow believers, but also practiced this thankfulness in his letters. Most of Paul's letters contain a section offering thanksgiving or praise to God for his many blessings. In his prayers of thanksgiving, Paul offers heartfelt gratitude to God for a variety of spiritual blessings. He thanks God for his readers' faith, love, hope, grace, and partnership in the gospel. It is not surprising, then, that Paul urges his readers to follow his example. Later in Ephesians he exhorts his audience to be filled with the Spirit, which involves "giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Eph. 5:20; cf. Col. 3:17; 1 Thess. 5:18). Because "we know that for those who love God all things work together for good" (Rom. 8:28), we are able to give thanks in every circumstance.

<span id="page-42-7"></span><span id="page-42-5"></span><span id="page-42-4"></span><span id="page-42-3"></span><span id="page-42-2"></span><span id="page-42-1"></span><span id="page-42-0"></span>Paul's thanksgivings seem to be intricately tied to his prayers. When he gives thanks for his readers, he often expresses that thanksgiving as a prayer to God (Rom. 1:9–10; Eph. 1:16; Col. 1:3; 1 Thess. 1:2; Philem. 4). Prayer was obviously important to Paul. He not only offers prayers in his letters; he also frequently asks for prayers *from* his readers (Rom. 15:30; Col. 4:3; 1 Thess. 5:25; 2 Thess. 3:1; Philem. 22). Because of his dependence on God for all things, Paul relies on the power of prayer for success in his daily life. It is therefore not surprising that Paul likewise urges his readers to pray not only for him but also constantly (cf. Rom. 12:12; Eph. 6:18; Phil. 4:6; Col. 4:2; 1 Thess. 5:17). He likewise exhorts the people of Ephesus to pray for all people (1 Tim. 2:1), calling the men to pray, "lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling" (1 Tim. 2:8). According to Paul's example and apostolic exhortations, we ought to live in recognition that prayer is essential for the Christian life.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-43-5"></span>This section is a practical example of how God's power, demonstrated in the resurrection and enthronement of Christ, is at work in the life of the believer. Although this paragraph is grammatically complex, the main thought is clear: "God . . . made us alive . . . and raised us up . . . and seated us . . ." (Eph. 2:4–6). These actions do not take place in isolation but are each based on the believer's union with Christ. Believers are made alive *together with Christ*, raised *with Christ*, and seated *with Christ*.

<span id="page-43-7"></span><span id="page-43-6"></span><span id="page-43-2"></span>This paragraph can be divided into two sections. The first section has two parts: (1) living in bondage and under wrath (vv. 1–3) and (2) living and reigning with Christ by grace (vv. 4–7). The second section summarizes the nature of the salvation possessed by God's people (vv. 8–10). Verse 5 should be seen as the central statement and climax of the passage. The passage is a vivid reminder to believers of God's great work of salvation that takes those who are spiritually dead (vv. 1–3) and, because of his great kindness and grace secured through Christ's work on the cross, makes them alive and raises them and seats them with Christ.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-43-1"></span><span id="page-43-0"></span>2:1 Paul addresses the spiritual state of his readers by declaring that they were "dead in the trespasses and sins. . . ." This is the state not only of the most depraved of society but of all who have not trusted in Christ as Savior. Prior to conversion, every human since Adam lives in rebellion against God by transgressing his commands and sinning against him (Matt. 8:22; Luke 9:60; John 5:24). The reference to both *trespasses* and *sins* is probably an example of redundancy as Paul emphasizes the sinfulness of his readers' pre-conversion state.

<span id="page-43-4"></span><span id="page-43-3"></span>2:2–3 Paul further elaborates the condition of his readers prior to conversion, saying that they *walked* in trespasses and sins, referring to their behavior and conduct. But this is no longer true for those who have trusted in Christ Jesus—a reality indicated by "once" (vv. 2, 3). Paul draws a sharp contrast between his readers' past and present condition. They were "once" living this way, but now they have

#### Eph esians 2:1–10 44

First, they formerly followed "the course of this world" (v. 2). That is, before knowing Christ, the behavior of the Ephesian believers was determined by the powerful influence of the culture and society in which they lived. Their preferences, attitudes, and habits were not according to God's standard or will but according to the standards of this world (cf. 1 John 2:15).

<span id="page-44-6"></span><span id="page-44-3"></span>Second, they also formerly followed "the prince of the power of the air" (Eph. 2:2), clearly a reference to the Devil or Satan. Paul acknowledges that the Devil is a powerful supernatural being, ruling over other evil spirits and possessing authority, and his realm of influence or authority is the "power of the air." Finally, the Devil is called "the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience." The Devil is a spiritual being, busily working his evil plan to destroy humanity. Evidently he is somewhat effective, since unbelievers are characterized by disobedience.

Third, our own flesh causes us to sin. All people, both Jew and Gentile, are affected by the fall and are "sons of disobedience" (v. 2). By "flesh" Paul refers not to the physical body or our physical existence but to our fallen, self-centered human nature. The result of this condition is that God's will is not followed; instead, the "desires of the body and the mind" (v. 3) are carried out.

<span id="page-44-4"></span><span id="page-44-1"></span>The dire situation for all humanity is not due merely to outside influences. When Paul says that they were "by nature" children of wrath, he refers to our condition as determined "by birth" (cf. Gal. 2:15). The expression "children of wrath" refers to people who deserve or are destined to experience God's wrath.

2:4–6 After spending three verses describing the desperate situation of mankind, Paul now introduces a glorious contrast: "But God" (v. 4). We were all destined to experience God's wrath, which would have been fair and just because we have all offended a holy God with our "trespasses and sins" (v. 1). Verse 4, however, offers two reasons why this dire predicament has changed: (1) because of God's mercy and (2) because of his great love. God's merciful character is clearly demonstrated throughout the Bible (e.g., Ex. 34:6; Ps. 103:8; Jonah 4:2; Titus 3:5). God's love is another motivation for the divine initiative in redeeming his people. This love is emphasized by the adjective "great" and the verbal form of the term that follows ("the great love with which he *loved* us"). Both mercy and love stand behind God's decision to call a people out of darkness and into his marvelous light.

<span id="page-44-5"></span><span id="page-44-2"></span><span id="page-44-0"></span>Just as Ephesians 2:1 began with our dire predicament, so verse 5 repeats that idea: God saved us "when we were dead in our trespasses." In order to heighten the contrast between man's predicament and God's rescue, Paul reiterates man's unregenerate state before highlighting God's intervening work. He then uses three verbs to describe God's gracious salvation—each of which underscores believers' union with Christ: "God . . . made us alive together *with* Christ . . . and raised us up *with* him and seated us *with* him" (vv. 4–6). What God has accomplished for the believer was accomplished first in Christ. There is a clear parallel between what God *did* in Christ and what he *does* in a Christian.

<span id="page-45-6"></span>After noting that God makes believers alive, Paul pauses to introduce the element of grace ("by grace you have been saved"; v. 5). While other religions focus on concepts such as "law" or "ritual," Christianity's key word is "grace." It is because of God's grace that we receive new life. This key statement was interjected here somewhat parenthetically, but Paul will return to the theme in more detail in verses 8–10.

<span id="page-45-10"></span><span id="page-45-8"></span><span id="page-45-1"></span>Paul often speaks of the believer's union with Christ (Rom. 6:3–4; Col. 2:12, 20; 3:1). Although Christ's resurrection was physical, it is clear in the context that both "being made alive" and "being raised" refer to the spiritual life possessed by believers resulting from Christ's resurrection and their union with him in that resurrection. The final verb, "being seated," refers to believers' present exaltation, specifically the privileges, honor, and authority they share as a result of their union with the exalted Christ. Paul may be emphasizing this present position in light of the hostile (demonic) powers frequently mentioned in this letter (Eph. 1:21; 2:1–2; 3:10; 6:10–20).

<span id="page-45-7"></span><span id="page-45-4"></span><span id="page-45-3"></span><span id="page-45-2"></span>2:7 God's divine purpose in salvation is to "show the immeasurable riches of his grace." God saves rebellious sinners in order to display his marvelous grace, which Paul highlights in at least two ways: (1) with the adjective "immeasurable" and (2) with the noun "riches" (or "wealth"). This statement about grace is even more astonishing when seen in light of the previous condition of sinners who were destined for and deserving of God's wrath (v. 3): Because of their union with Christ, those who were once enemies are now beloved children. Those who once had no mercy now have mercy. And those who were once without hope now have a living hope. Paul not only mentions God's "mercy" (v. 4), "love" (v. 4), and "grace" (vv. 5, 7); he also includes God's "kindness" (cf. Rom. 2:4; Titus 3:4). Specifically, his grace and kindness are directed "toward us in Christ Jesus." Furthermore, this display of glory is for not only this age but also "the coming ages." This phrase most likely refers to the unending epoch of time that will encompass all eternity. God's glory will be on display forever.

<span id="page-45-9"></span><span id="page-45-5"></span><span id="page-45-0"></span>2:8–9 These verses are tied to the previous section by "For," which introduces Paul's explanation of God's gracious salvation. Though we were dead in our sins and followed the influences of the world, the Devil, and the flesh, God made us alive, raised us, and seated us with Christ in the heavenly places. Thus, salvation is "by grace" (v. 8). Paul already mentioned this idea in verse 5 when he interrupted his thought to assert that salvation is grounded in grace. The grace that results in salvation is received "through faith." Note that we are saved *because of* or *on the basis of* grace, which is attained *by means of* or *through* faith. We are not saved because of or on the basis of faith. Faith does not save anyone. Only the grace we receive because of Christ's atonement saves us. Faith is merely the instrument by which grace is received—similar to a syringe that delivers lifesaving medicine. A person is "saved" because of the medicine, not because of the syringe. And yet, without the

syringe (i.e., faith), salvation would not be possible. Faith is the response by which salvation through the perfect work of Christ is received. Faith is not a meritorious work; it is simply trusting in what Christ has accomplished on our behalf.

<span id="page-46-6"></span>Verses 8b and 9 explain and amplify what it means to be saved by grace through faith. To do this, Paul uses a chiastic arrangement that includes two negative statements with a positive statement in the middle: "this is not your own doing" (A), "it is the gift of God" (B), "not a result of works" (A'). Salvation does not originate with us; it is a gift of God. If a gift is earned, it is no longer a gift.

Historically, there has been some debate as to the precise antecedent of "this": What, precisely, is not from us but a gift of God? Is it faith, grace, or something else? Although faith is the closest antecedent, the grammatical genders of "faith" and "this" in Greek do not match, and thus "faith" should be ruled out as the antecedent. The same is true for grace. Thus, most scholars and commentators agree that "this" refers to the entire clause. That is, both the grace and the faith we receive that result in salvation are not of our own doing but are gifts from God.

<span id="page-46-2"></span>Because salvation is not dependent on good works, "no one may boast" before God (v. 9; Rom. 3:27; Gal. 6:13; Phil. 3:3).

<span id="page-46-7"></span><span id="page-46-0"></span>2:10 Paul offers further evidence ("For") that salvation is by grace and not by works by indicating that salvation involves becoming a new creation. Believers are God's "workmanship" ( *poiēma*), a term that occurs only here and in Romans 1:20, where it refers to the works of God at creation. Here it designates God's work of the *new* creation (cf. Eph. 4:24; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).

<span id="page-46-4"></span><span id="page-46-3"></span>Paul then informs his readers that they were "created in Christ Jesus for good works." Believers are created for the purpose of good works. Furthermore, God has *predestined* believers to perform such works ("prepared beforehand"; cf. Rom. 9:23). For Paul, the completely free and gracious nature of salvation does not lead to complacency or passivity. It is only when the nature of salvation is misunderstood or abused that God's grace is misused (Rom. 3:8; 6:1, 16).

<span id="page-46-5"></span><span id="page-46-1"></span>Believers are called to "walk" in the good works God has previously prepared for them. By using the verb "walk," Paul ties together the beginning of this chapter ("walked"; Eph. 2:2) with this part, forming an inclusio. Salvation, from beginning to end—even the good works believers perform—is a result of God's grace. There is therefore no boasting before God, since he is the author and perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2).

### <span id="page-46-8"></span>*Response*

This passage contains one of the clearest NT descriptions of the gospel. God, because of his mercy, grace, and love, made believers alive together with Christ. But this reality cannot be fully appreciated without the knowledge and awareness of our dire predicament prior to receiving God's unmerited grace.

All humanity is in bondage to sin. In fact, we were "dead" in our trespasses and sins. Humanity is not merely sick or ailing but is spiritually bankrupt. We cannot

improve our standing before God, for we have neither the ability nor the desire to do so. Instead, as unbelievers we were influenced by the world, the Devil, and the flesh. The "world" in this passage refers to that which is opposed to God—the cultural, social, political, or economic ideologies or forces hostile to God and his ways.

<span id="page-47-3"></span><span id="page-47-2"></span><span id="page-47-1"></span>At the same time, it is important for Christians to remember that Satan is a defeated foe. Jesus has been raised from the dead and is seated at God's right hand, "far above all rule and authority and power and dominion" (Eph. 1:21). "He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him" (Col. 2:15). Through his death he was able to "destroy the one who has the power of death" (Heb. 2:14). Indeed, "the reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8). The outcome is certain: every knee will bow to Jesus as Lord, while the Devil will be thrown into the lake of fire. And yet, until that day, we must be vigilant in the fight against both the world and the Devil.

<span id="page-47-4"></span>Finally, the battle is not merely external. There is also an internal foe: the flesh, or sinful nature, that is, the propensity or inclination to sin against God or others. This condition is a result of the fall of Adam and is passed on to every human being. Although our old self has been crucified with Christ, we still battle against it. It is only through the power of God in the gospel that we can overcome our desires and the temptations to sin.

The result of living in our sins is that we deserve God's wrath. God is holy and therefore must punish sin. And yet God is also loving. Both are true, which is why the cross was necessary. Jesus was punished for his people, experiencing the wrath of God that they deserved. In this way, God's wrath and love are inseparable attributes of his character. The focus of the passage, however, is clearly on God's love. He is a God full of mercy, grace, and love and has provided a way of escape through his Son.

<span id="page-47-0"></span>God not only saves us *from* our sin; he also saves us *for* good works. Paul is absolutely clear that good works do not save a person. However, he does maintain that God calls all believers to a virtuous life. Elsewhere Christians are commanded to live holy lives (1 Pet. 1:16; cf. Lev. 19:2). But both the desire and the ability to do so come only from a relationship with the living God, who breathes new life into those who are spiritually dead.

### <span id="page-48-5"></span>EPHESIANS 2:11–22

**<sup>11</sup>**Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called "the uncircumcision" by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— **<sup>12</sup>** remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. **<sup>13</sup>**But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. **14**For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility **15**by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, **<sup>16</sup>** and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. **17**And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. **18**For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. **<sup>19</sup>** So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,*<sup>1</sup>* but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, **20**built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, **<sup>21</sup>** in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. **<sup>22</sup>** In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by*<sup>2</sup>* the Spirit.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-48-6"></span><span id="page-48-3"></span><span id="page-48-2"></span><span id="page-48-1"></span><span id="page-48-0"></span>Paul transitions from describing the state of all humanity (2:1–3) to the plight of Gentiles as alienated from God and his people (vv. 11–12, 19–22). In addition, the focus shifts from the resurrection, ascension, and enthronement of Christ (vv. 4–7) to his death on the cross (vv. 13–16). Or, as Frank Thielman has noted, "The primary orientation of 2:1–10 is vertical, and the primary orientation of 2:11–22 is horizontal."10 Discussion of the vertical alienation that existed between unbelievers and God (vv. 1–10) transitions to discussion of the horizontal alienation between Jews and Gentiles and the peace and reconciliation brought about by Christ's sacrificial death. "Peace" (*eirēnē*) appears four times in this passage (vv. 14, 15, 17 [2x]) and is its primary theme.

<span id="page-48-10"></span><span id="page-48-9"></span><span id="page-48-7"></span><span id="page-48-4"></span>This paragraph contains three sections. The first (vv. 11–13) explains the pre-Christian past of the Ephesian Gentiles as well as their present position of acceptance as a result of being united to Christ. The second section (vv. 14–18) provides

<span id="page-49-3"></span>the rationale ("for") of how the Gentile believers are brought near to God through the reconciling death of Christ. The third (vv. 19–22) reiterates the truths of the first section, emphasizing the unity of Jews and Gentiles by employing building and household metaphors.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-49-1"></span><span id="page-49-0"></span>2:11–12 Paul begins this section with the conjunction "therefore" (*dio*), urging his readers to recall both their former situation as those separated from God and the subsequent grace they have received in light of the truths of 2:1–10. Verse 11 contains the only imperative in the first half of the letter: the Gentile believers at Ephesus are exhorted to "remember" their plight before coming to saving faith in Christ and consequently being accepted into God's family and receiving all of its accompanying privileges. Before he identifies precisely what they are to remember, he identifies their previous situation ("at one time"). They are described as (1) "Gentiles in the flesh" (i.e., uncircumcised Gentiles) and (2) those called "the uncircumcision," or, more literally, "foreskin," a derogatory term for Gentiles. The point is that Gentiles did not have the covenant sign of circumcision and were therefore estranged from God. But Paul does not let his fellow Jews off the hook here. They are the so-called circumcision, made "in the flesh." Even more critical is his comment that such a circumcision was "made . . . by hands," signifying the work of humans in contrast to the work of God.

<span id="page-49-2"></span>In verse 12 Paul returns to his exhortation of what he desires the Ephesian Gentile believers to "remember." Because of the lengthy description of Paul's readers in verse 11, the ESV repeats the verb for the sake of clarity. Specifically, Paul identifies five deficiencies summarizing the prior situation ("at that time") of his readers that they are to remember. The deficiencies of the Gentiles are in <span id="page-50-4"></span>contrast to the genuine blessings Israel possessed as God's covenant people (cf. Rom. 3:2; 9:4–5).

<span id="page-50-11"></span><span id="page-50-9"></span><span id="page-50-7"></span><span id="page-50-3"></span>First, Paul notes that the Gentiles were "separated from Christ" (Eph. 2:12). This deficiency represents the main issue, indicated by its placement first in the list. If every spiritual blessing (1:3–14) is available only to those united with Christ (1:3), and if our rescue from the world, the Devil, and the flesh comes from being united with Christ (2:5–6), then to be without Christ is to forfeit those blessings and that status. The second deficiency is that they were "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel." That is, Gentiles were estranged from the chosen people of God and all the accompanying privileges belonging to those with citizenship in Israel (cf. Acts 22:28). Third, the Gentiles were "strangers to the covenants of promise." In the OT, God made several covenants with his chosen people. These covenants included the blessings and favor of God and the hope of a coming Messiah. The Gentiles were strangers to these blessings. Fourth, they had "no hope." That is, objectively the Gentiles had no firm foundation on which to base any hope. They had no hope of a messianic salvation or future resurrection (cf. 1 Thess. 4:13). Finally, they were "without God in the world." Most Gentiles, of course, believed in not just one god but many (1 Cor. 8:5–6; Gal. 4:8)—so this critique could have sounded hollow to their ears. But Paul is stressing that they had no relationship with (i.e., belief in) the true and living God, the God who created heaven and earth and sent his Son to die on a cross.

<span id="page-50-15"></span><span id="page-50-12"></span><span id="page-50-10"></span><span id="page-50-8"></span><span id="page-50-6"></span><span id="page-50-2"></span>2:13 This verse represents a dramatic shift ("But now") and is reminiscent of the previous section ("But God"; 2:4). This transition is also highlighted by the contrast of "at one time" ( *pote*; 2:11) and "at that time" (*tō kairō ekeinō*; 2:12) with "now," which emphasizes the believers' current condition. Based on their union with Christ ("in Christ"), their status has been completely reversed. They were "once . . . far off" but now they "have been brought near." It is likely that the imagery of *far* and *near* is borrowed from Isaiah 57:19: "'Peace, peace, to the far and to the near,' says the Lord, 'and I will heal him.'" In addition, Gentile nations are described as being "far" (Deut. 28:49; 29:22; 1 Kings 8:41; Isa. 5:26; Jer. 5:15; cf. Acts 2:39; 22:21), whereas Israel is described as being "near" (Ps. 148:14). This eschatological inclusion the Gentiles are experiencing is "by the blood of Christ"—that is, through the sacrificial death of Jesus.

<span id="page-50-14"></span><span id="page-50-13"></span><span id="page-50-5"></span><span id="page-50-1"></span><span id="page-50-0"></span>2:14 After urging the Ephesian believers to remember their past situation, Paul reminds them to recall their present reality: Christ is their peace. "For" (*gar*) looks back to the previous section and offers the reason those who were far off have now been brought near: it is through Jesus' death ("by the blood of Christ"; v. 13) that those who were enemies of God (Rom. 5:10) have been brought near. Paul states this emphatically by writing that Christ *himself* is our peace. "Peace" is the theme of this section, as the term occurs four times (Eph. 2:14, 15, 17 [2x]). Christ is not merely the bringer of peace but is *himself* peace (Col. 3:15). The peace of Christ has certain consequences in the life of the believer. First, Christ has made both Jewish <span id="page-51-4"></span>and Gentile believers one (Eph. 2:14a). There was formerly hostility and discord between these two, but Christ has brought peace.

Second, Christ has also "broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility." The wall that Paul is referring to here is most likely metaphorical, signifying the Mosaic law, which divided Jews and Gentiles. Specifically, food laws, Sabbath restrictions, and circumcision would have separated the Jewish people from other cultures and religions around them. Some have also suggested that Paul had a specific example of this "dividing wall" in mind, namely, the wall around the temple separating the Court of Gentiles from the inner courts and the sanctuary. The Jewish historian Josephus described this wall as being about 4.5 feet (1.4 m) tall, with warning signs posted all around the wall in both Latin and Greek. Two of the warning signs have been discovered and read as follows: "No foreigner is to enter within the railing and enclosure around the temple. Whoever is caught shall have himself to blame for his consequent death."11

<span id="page-51-6"></span><span id="page-51-0"></span>2:15–16 The dividing wall was torn down by means of Christ's death on the cross ("in his flesh"; v. 14). What does Paul mean in saying that the "law" was abolished? He is not claiming that the law is completely useless or destroyed (cf. Rom. 3:31). Instead, the "ordinances" put in place to separate Jews and Gentiles are no longer in force.

<span id="page-51-2"></span><span id="page-51-1"></span>Christ abolished this law for two reasons: First, "that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace." Paul's use of "create" (*ktizō*) signifies a new creation (cf. Eph. 2:10). Through the death of Christ, both Jew and Gentile are brought together and form a new humanity (cf. 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). The resulting status between Jew and Gentile believers is "peace." With the hostility or enmity of division removed, God's peace is established.

<span id="page-51-8"></span>Second, Christ set aside this law so that he "might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross." The horizontal peace mentioned in the previous verse is not possible without the vertical peace referenced here. Believing Jews and Gentiles cannot be united into a new humanity if they are not both first united to the unifying God. The verb "reconcile" (*apokatallassō*) occurs elsewhere only in Colossians 1:20 and 22. Christ reconciled both Jews and Gentiles to God "in one body," which is a reference not to the crucified body of Christ but to the "one new man" (Eph. 2:15), the church. This unity was accomplished "through the cross." Just as verse 13 stated that Gentile believers have been brought near to God "by the blood of Christ," and verse 14 referenced "in his flesh," so once again the atoning death of Christ is the focus. The final clause in this verse, "thereby killing the hostility," indicates the result of Christ's work: the hostility between God and man was removed by the death of Christ.

<span id="page-51-7"></span><span id="page-51-5"></span><span id="page-51-3"></span>2:17–18 Paul continues to remind his audience of the great privileges God has granted them in Christ. He first declares that Christ "came and preached peace to

<sup>11</sup> Author's translation; see Josephus, *Antiquities* 15.11.5; *Jewish Wars* 5.5.2.

<span id="page-52-12"></span>you who were far off and peace to those who were near." Although it is difficult to be certain, this probably refers to Jesus' preaching in the Spirit through his apostles. This interpretation is supported by Ephesians 3:5 and 8, where Paul testifies that the mystery of Christ has been revealed to the apostles, and especially to Paul himself, to preach (*euangelizomai* ) this message to the Gentiles.

<span id="page-52-8"></span><span id="page-52-5"></span>The gospel message is a proclamation of peace — peace between God and fallen humanity. In verse 17 Paul employs the term "peace" two more times (cf. 2:14, 15), again demonstrating that it is the key idea of this section. "Peace" here most likely refers primarily to the peace between God and believers, which by consequence must lead to peace between Jews and Gentiles. The phrases "you who were far off" and "those who were near" refer to "Gentiles" and "Jews," respectively. Paul's wording is possibly drawn from Isaiah 52:7 (cf. Acts 10:36) and Isaiah 57:19.

<span id="page-52-9"></span><span id="page-52-7"></span><span id="page-52-1"></span><span id="page-52-0"></span>In Ephesians 2:18 Paul provides the reason peace can be proclaimed to Jews *and* Gentiles: "For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father" (cf. v. 16). In the OT, "access" to God was severely restricted. But now, through Christ's atoning death and reconciling work, believers can enter the presence of God. Later in Ephesians Paul says that in Christ "we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him" (3:12; cf. Rom. 5:1–2). Finally, notice the Trinitarian formulation: believers have access through Christ, in the Spirit, with the Father.

<span id="page-52-10"></span><span id="page-52-6"></span><span id="page-52-2"></span>2:19a This verse transitions to the third section of the passage with the words "So then," which provide the logical consequences of the statements made in verses 14–18. In order to express the mighty reconciling work of Jesus, Paul employs a variety of metaphors (political, familial, and religious). First, because of the reconciliation brought by Christ's sacrifice, Gentiles who were described as "strangers" are now "fellow citizens." A "stranger" is someone from another tribe or country, and in verse 12 the term was used to describe Gentiles' being strangers to the covenants of promise. Paul is declaring that believers who were once considered foreigners are now, along with other believers ("the saints"), citizens in God's kingdom (cf. Phil. 3:20). Gentile believers now have a homeland and are therefore fellow citizens of God's heavenly kingdom.

<span id="page-52-13"></span><span id="page-52-11"></span><span id="page-52-4"></span><span id="page-52-3"></span>2:19b Because of the reconciliation brought about by Christ's sacrifice, Gentiles who were described as "aliens" are now also "members of the household of God." "Aliens" are those who live in a land as foreigners. They are in the land but do not have the rights and privileges of citizens. So, as strangers and aliens, Gentiles were essentially considered outsiders. But now, Paul declares, those who have been reconciled to God through Christ have been brought into God's household. They have been adopted and granted all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of children of the heavenly Father (1:5; 2:18). Paul uses household language to give confidence and assurance to his Gentile readers that their heavenly Father receives them as children and will protect and provide for them.

<span id="page-53-6"></span>2:20 Because of the reconciling work of Christ, Paul can also describe the Gentiles as the building stones used in God's holy temple. Because "house" (or "household") can also refer to a spiritual house or temple, Paul easily transitions to his third metaphor. The significance of the temple is that it is where God dwells. There are at least six characteristics of this spiritual temple.

First, God is the one building it. Twice in this passage Paul uses the divine passive to signify that it is God who is responsible for building his holy temple. It is "built" (*epoikodomeō*; 2:20) on a secure foundation, and together believers "are being built" (*synoikodomeō*; 2:22) as a dwelling place for God.

<span id="page-53-8"></span><span id="page-53-1"></span>Second, this temple is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets." "Foundation" communicates the location on which this spiritual temple of God is built: the foundation is nothing other than the apostles and prophets ("the foundation *consisting of* the apostles and prophets"). Paul is referring here to NT apostles and prophets. "Apostle" should be interpreted with its more technical meaning, referring to someone chosen, commissioned, and sent by the Lord Jesus Christ, including the Twelve (Matt. 10:2; Acts 1:13; 1 Cor. 15:5, 7) and Paul himself (1 Cor. 9:1; 15:9). "Prophet" refers to "one who is endowed by the Holy Spirit with the gift of prophecy for the purpose of edification, comfort, and encouragement (1 Cor. 14:3, 31), as well as for the purpose of understanding and communicating the mysteries and revelation of God to the church (12:10; 13:2; 14:6, 22, 30–31)."12 Believers are built upon the authoritative and normative teaching of the apostles and prophets, a teaching that arose from divine revelation.

<span id="page-53-10"></span><span id="page-53-5"></span><span id="page-53-4"></span><span id="page-53-3"></span><span id="page-53-2"></span><span id="page-53-0"></span>The third distinctive of the temple is that Christ Jesus is its "cornerstone." In the NT, this term occurs only here and in 1 Peter 2:6. Both references are based on Isaiah 28:16 (the only place the term is found in the OT). The cornerstone was the most important stone of the foundation, bearing the weight of the building and tying the walls firmly together. Christ is the anchor of the foundation (1 Cor. 3:11) that is built by the apostles and prophets through their oral and written proclamation of the gospel of Christ. This new temple is built on Christ, the vital cornerstone.

<span id="page-53-7"></span>2:21 The fourth feature is that only those who are united with Christ make up the stones in this spiritual temple. Verses 21 and 22 both begin with the expression "in whom/him," referring to Christ Jesus the cornerstone in verse 20. Throughout Ephesians Paul has emphasized the believer's union with Christ, and this passage is certainly no exception. It is only through our faith in Christ that we become part of God's people, household, or temple.

<span id="page-53-9"></span>The fifth characteristic of the temple is that it is not complete but is currently under construction and growing (cf. 4:16). The growth Paul has in mind here seems to be both spiritual growth (into a *holy* temple) and numerical (as Gentiles who believe are added to the structure). The picture here is that the members of God's temple are placed stone by stone into the structure of the building until it is complete.

<span id="page-54-8"></span>2:22 The final distinctive feature of the temple is that it is God's dwelling place. In the previous verse, Paul referenced God's holy "temple" (*naos*), which refers to the temple proper (whereas *hieron* refers to the temple compound). In the OT, God's presence was uniquely located in the temple (Lev. 26:12; 1 Cor. 3:16–17; 2 Cor. 6:16). Thus, God is building this temple as his dwelling place by his Spirit.

<span id="page-54-3"></span><span id="page-54-0"></span>The status of Gentiles who now believe in Jesus as the Messiah has been completely transformed. Those who were Christ-less ("separated from Christ"), homeless ("alienated from the commonwealth of Israel"), friendless ("strangers to the covenants of promise"), hopeless ("having no hope"), and Godless ("without God") are now citizens, members, and God's dwelling place.

### *Response*

#### REMEMBRANCE

<span id="page-54-2"></span><span id="page-54-1"></span>Just as the Israelites were often urged to remember their past, especially their slavery in Egypt and God's deliverance in the exodus (Deut. 5:15; 15:15; 16:12; 24:18, 22), so are we exhorted to remember our former separation and alienation from God. Paul does not give his readers new instruction but rather reminds them of what they already know in order to make them more cognizant of these truths and to encourage them to respond appropriately. It is healthy for us to remember where we have come from and where we now stand by God's grace. In our fastpaced world, with its constant deluge of new technologies, it is easy to focus solely on the future. Paul's exhortation is all the more crucial for us: we should slow down and reflect on God's faithfulness in remaking us—from those who were not a people, into his own people.

#### RECONCILIATION

<span id="page-54-6"></span><span id="page-54-4"></span>This passage emphasizes reconciliation both vertical (between God and believers) and horizontal (between Jewish and Gentile believers). Believers, both Jew and Gentile, are reconciled "to God in one body" (v. 16). Paul thoroughly grounds the reconciliation and resulting peace in the ministry and work of Christ. Our reconciliation was accomplished "by the blood of Christ" (v. 13), "in his flesh" (v. 14), and "through the cross" (v. 16). This reconciliation represents the basis on which all other reconciliation should be established. Without a peaceful relationship with our Maker, we will ultimately fail to experience peace in other relationships. But the very fact that such reconciliation has taken place has implications for all of life, particularly in relationships between Jews and Gentiles. Horizontal reconciliation dominates this passage. According to Paul, because of Christ's sacrifice the dividing wall of hostility has been broken down (v. 14) and God has created "one new man in place of the two, so making peace" (v. 15). The radical implication of this new reality is that Gentiles "are no longer strangers and aliens" but are part of God's kingdom, family, and new temple (v. 19).

<span id="page-54-7"></span><span id="page-54-5"></span>Whatever tensions existed between Jewish and Gentile believers in Ephesus (or the surrounding areas) ran contrary to the very nature of the gospel. So Paul <span id="page-55-2"></span><span id="page-55-0"></span>reminds his readers of the new status of Gentile Christians as completely accepted by God. Jewish believers had no theological ground for rejecting Gentile believers or viewing them as outsiders to God's promises. Similarly, Gentiles could not look down on Jews as those who were culturally rejected by most of society. Both groups formed one new people of God. This message applies anywhere race, ethnicity, or economic status divides Christians from one another. According to Revelation, believers from "every tribe and language and people and nation" (Rev. 5:9) will worship around God's throne. But often the church on earth does not look like the church in heaven. We must work hard not to contradict the gospel inadvertently by refusing to worship, fellowship, or serve with people who look, speak, or act differently than we do. The gospel unites all believers together into one family and one temple (cf. Eph. 4:1–6). Jesus is the "Prince of Peace" (Isa. 9:6; cf. Eph. 2:14) and has brought peace to his people (John 14:27; Eph. 2:17). The church, with all of its diversity, is built on one foundation (apostles and prophets) and has one cornerstone (Jesus Christ). We must strive, then, to display the unity Christ has secured.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-56-10"></span><span id="page-56-3"></span><span id="page-56-0"></span>In 1:15–23 Paul offered a word of thanksgiving and prayer for the Ephesian believers, and now in 3:1–13 he appears to be set to pray again for his readers. After referring to his own situation as a prisoner of Christ on behalf of the Gentiles, however, he breaks off into a long digression regarding his unique ministry to the Gentiles and how this relates to the divine mystery. He returns to his prayer in verse 14, which is indicated by the repetition of "for this reason." This digression, however, forms a coherent unit bracketed by references to Paul's suffering on behalf of his readers ("I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles" [v. 1]; "what I am suffering for you" [v. 13]).

<span id="page-56-9"></span><span id="page-56-8"></span><span id="page-56-7"></span><span id="page-56-6"></span><span id="page-56-5"></span><span id="page-56-2"></span>This section can be further divided into two main parts. The first (vv. 2–7) is set off by repetition of a reference to God's grace being given to Paul (vv. 2, 7), forming an inclusio. In the second part (vv. 8–12), Paul explains his role in proclaiming God's mystery. Several themes are repeated: "mystery" (vv. 3, 4, 6 [added for the sake of clarity in ESV], 9), "made known" (vv. 3, 5, 10), "grace" (vv. 2, 7, 8), and "given" (vv. 2, 7, 8). This section, then, seems to have two main purposes: (1) to provide a divine perspective on Paul's imprisonment and suffering; and (2) to explain the nature of the divine "mystery," along with Paul's role and responsibility as a steward of it.

### *Section Outline*

### *Comment*

<span id="page-56-1"></span>3:1 "For this reason" refers back to 2:11–22 (esp. vv. 19–22). Paul designates himself a "prisoner of Christ Jesus." Interestingly, Paul does not say that he is a prisoner "of Caesar." In Paul's view, he belongs to Christ and ultimately is in prison for the sake of the gospel. In fact, he continues by saying that he is a prisoner "on behalf of you Gentiles." Paul is not in prison because of his sin, because God is punishing him, or because of anything else that might cause his readers to doubt his apostleship. Instead, Paul's incarceration is due to his faithfulness in fulfilling his apostolic calling to take the gospel to the Gentiles.

<span id="page-56-4"></span>3:2 This verse marks the beginning of Paul's digression from his original intention (i.e., prayer) as he expands on the origin and nature of his role as an apostle to the Gentiles. In this context, "stewardship" refers to the responsibility God has given to Paul to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. "Stewardship of God's grace" should probably be understood as meaning "stewardship, which is the grace from God." Paul further indicates that this stewardship was given (by God) for the benefit of his readers (and other Gentiles).

<span id="page-57-11"></span><span id="page-57-8"></span><span id="page-57-4"></span>3:3 Paul further elaborates on what his readers have read of his stewardship and his reception of the divine mystery. In 1:9 "mystery" referred to Jews and Gentiles being incorporated into Christ's body and thus participating in God's salvation (cf. 3:6). Paul uses the passive voice, with the implied subject being God (i.e., a divine passive). The revelation Paul received was not the result of his own efforts; it was the result of God's revealing it to him. The means by which Paul received this insight was "by revelation" (cf. Gal. 1:12), which probably refers to his Damascus road experience.

<span id="page-57-6"></span><span id="page-57-5"></span><span id="page-57-3"></span>Paul concludes this verse by noting this is not the first time he has referenced the reality of the divine mystery. When he says, "I have written" (lit., "I have written beforehand" [*prographō*]), he is referring to what he wrote in 1:9–10 or, more probably, 2:11–22. Paul is speaking of the revelation God made known to him specifically, the message of reconciliation and peace between Jews and Gentiles, who now form "one new man" (2:15).

<span id="page-57-12"></span><span id="page-57-9"></span><span id="page-57-7"></span>3:4 The content of the material Paul has previously written (esp. 2:11–22) serves as the standard by which the Ephesian Christians are to judge Paul's understanding of the divine mystery. When Paul says, "When you read this," it almost certainly refers to the public reading of the letter during worship (cf. Col. 4:16; 1 Thess. 5:27; Rev. 1:3). As the letter was read, the readers would have been able to perceive and evaluate Paul's ability to unravel the mystery of Christ.

<span id="page-57-13"></span><span id="page-57-2"></span>Paul was given "insight" from God into the special revelation. The expression "insight into" is found in the OT, especially in Daniel, where it is used in contexts of interpreting and understanding the revelation of God mediated through dreams and visions (Dan. 1:4, 17; 9:13, 23; 10:1, 11). "The mystery of Christ" most likely means the mystery *about* Christ. Again, this mystery is specifically related to the inclusion of the Gentiles, along with Jews, into the body of Christ to form the one people of God. Paul's desire is that his readers (and hearers) will comprehend the importance of the revelation God has given him—a revelation once hidden but now openly declared: in Christ, both Jew *and Gentile* can have the privileged status of being part of God's family.

<span id="page-57-10"></span>3:5 This verse clarifies that the mystery (vv. 3, 4) was not something previously known. Many have noted the (antithetical) parallelism found in the two parts of this verse that divides into three sections: (1) the time ("in other generations" vs. "now"); (2) the verb of revelation ("was not made known" vs. "has been revealed"); and (3) the recipients ("to the sons of men" vs. "to his holy apostles and prophets"). That "which" was hidden in the past (i.e., the "mystery") has now been revealed by the Spirit of God to his people through the apostles and prophets. "Sons of men" is a Semitism for mankind (cf. Gen. 11:5; Joel 1:12).

<span id="page-57-1"></span><span id="page-57-0"></span>The conjunction "as" most likely indicates that no revelation concerning the mystery was revealed in the OT. This interpretation does not mean, however, that there were no OT references to the blessings that would come to the Gentiles (cf. Gen. 12:3; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14) or to the future inclusion of the Gentiles within <span id="page-58-12"></span><span id="page-58-1"></span>Israel (cf. Lev. 19:34; Deut. 10:18–19; 1 Kings 8:41–43). And yet, there indeed was no indication that Jews and Gentiles would be joined together into the body of Christ. The mystery God has now revealed (note the divine passive verb) was given "to his holy apostles and prophets" (cf. Eph. 2:20). The apostles and prophets are called "holy" because of their special consecration and unique calling as recipients of God's divine revelation. This revelation was made known to them by means of "the Spirit."

<span id="page-58-14"></span><span id="page-58-11"></span><span id="page-58-9"></span><span id="page-58-5"></span><span id="page-58-0"></span>3:6 Using three terms in Greek, Paul finally clarifies the content of the mystery: believing Gentiles are now "fellow heirs" (*synklēronoma*), "members of the same body" (*syssōma*), and "partakers" (*symmetocha*) of the promise. The first term, "fellow heirs," recalls the theme of inheritance, found earlier in Ephesians (1:11, 14, 18; cf. 5:5) and elsewhere in Paul's writings (Rom. 8:17; Gal. 3:18; Col. 3:24), and harks back to God's promise to Abraham that "in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed" (Gen. 12:3). The second term, literally "fellow body-members" is very rare and may have been coined by Paul. Gentile believers have been incorporated in the same body and have become "one new man" (Eph. 2:15) or "one body" (2:16). Together both Jews and Gentiles form the body of Christ, the church. The third descriptor, "partakers of the promise," recalls the earlier reference that the Gentiles were "strangers to the covenants of promise" (2:12). This "promise" could refer to either the Holy Spirit (1:13) or the blessings to come to the Gentiles mentioned in God's promise to Abraham (Gal. 3:8; cf. Rom. 4:13). It is possible that both are in view, as they often seem to merge together (Eph. 1:13; Isa. 32:15; 44:3; Ezek. 11:19; 36:26–27; 37:14; Joel 3:1–2). Finally, Paul adds that these blessings coming to Gentile Christians specifically result from union with Christ and through the proclamation and reception of the gospel. Thus in this verse Paul offers a summary of the message of the letter up to this point by straightforwardly stating his thesis.

<span id="page-58-15"></span><span id="page-58-13"></span><span id="page-58-10"></span><span id="page-58-4"></span><span id="page-58-3"></span><span id="page-58-2"></span>3:7 This verse is transitional, bringing the discussion concerning the content of the mystery to a conclusion while introducing Paul's role as God's divinely commissioned steward of the mystery. In verse 2 Paul spoke of the "stewardship of God's grace that was given to me," and here he says that he is a "minister according to the gift of God's grace," forming an inclusio.

<span id="page-58-16"></span><span id="page-58-8"></span><span id="page-58-7"></span><span id="page-58-6"></span>Paul says that he became a minister (*diakonos*, "servant") of the gospel. This appointment was not of Paul's own choosing but was a divine appointment "according to the gift of God's grace." Paul often referred not only to himself as a "minister" (1 Cor. 3:5; 2 Cor. 3:6; 6:4; 11:23) but also to his coworkers (Tychicus [Eph. 6:21 and Col. 4:7], Phoebe [Rom. 16:1], Apollos [1 Cor. 3:5], Timothy [Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 4:6], and Epaphras [Col. 1:7]) in the same manner. When Paul speaks of the "gift of God's grace," this phrase should most likely be understood as the "gift, which is God's grace." That is, the gift is the grace Paul received. He describes himself not as a hero but as a servant who is merely the recipient of God's grace (cf. 1 Cor. 15:10). Finally, Paul says that this grace was given to him "by the working of his power."

<span id="page-59-5"></span>3:8–9 These two verses further expand Paul's sense of thanksgiving and amazement for the commission he had freely received to be Christ's ambassador to the nations. Paul begins by emphatically declaring that grace was given "to me." He then describes himself as "the very least of all the saints." The word translated "very least" literally means "less than the least" or "the leastmost." In 1 Corinthians 15:9 Paul declares himself to be the least of all the *apostles* but here he broadens the scope to all the *saints* (cf. also 1 Tim. 1:15).

<span id="page-59-8"></span><span id="page-59-4"></span><span id="page-59-2"></span><span id="page-59-0"></span>Paul again reiterates that the grace he received "was given" to him by God (cf. Eph. 3:2, 7). He did not earn it or deserve it. "This grace" Paul received is what enabled him to fulfill his ministry of bringing the gospel to the Gentiles. Paul then unpacks the purposes of the grace given to him. First, this grace was given so that Paul could "preach to the Gentiles" (v. 8; cf. Rom. 11:13). Specifically, Paul was called to preach the "unsearchable riches of Christ." The word translated "unsearchable" could also be rendered "inscrutable" or "incomprehensible" and refers to something "impossible to understand on the basis of careful examination or investigation"13 (cf. Rom. 11:33). That which is unsearchable is the boundless wealth that belongs to Christ.

<span id="page-59-6"></span><span id="page-59-3"></span><span id="page-59-1"></span>Second, Paul was given grace "to bring to light . . . the plan of the mystery" (Eph. 3:9). As Paul preached the unsearchable riches of Christ in the gospel to the Gentiles, those who repented and believed were reconciled to God through his Son. Consequently, they were united with Christ in his death and resurrection and became fellow members of the body of Christ. And since Jewish believers also were part of this "one new man" (2:15), Jews and Gentiles were united to each other through their common faith. In doing this, God was working out his plan once hidden but now being revealed as Gentile believers come to faith. Paul further states that this message is "for everyone." Paul was tasked to reveal God's message not only to Gentiles but to all, both Gentile and Jew.

Paul once again highlights the importance of the mystery regarding the unity of Jewish and Gentile believers by describing it in three ways. (1) The mystery was "hidden." That is, it was planned by God but not revealed to his people. (2) The mystery was hidden "for ages." This prepositional phrase refers to time—from ages past. (3) The mystery was hidden "in God": knowledge of the secret resided with God and God alone. Paul then describes God as the one "who created all things." As the sovereign Creator, God will ensure that his once-hidden plan is carried out according to his perfect design.

<span id="page-59-7"></span>3:10 The purpose for which Paul preached the unsearchable riches of Christ to the Gentiles is now stated: "that . . . the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known." "Now" contrasts with the mystery hidden "for ages" (v. 9) and suggests a new era has begun, thus indicating a salvation-historical reference point. God's wisdom is described as "manifold" ( *polypoikilos*), a term that occurs only here in

<sup>13</sup> BDAG, s.v. ἀνεξιχνιαστος; J. P. Louw and Eugene Nida, *Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament: Based on Semantic Domains* (New York: United Bible Societies, 1989), §32.23.

the Bible and means "to be varied beyond measure and in a way which surpasses all previous knowledge thereof."14

<span id="page-60-2"></span>Although God is the ultimate agent who makes this mystery known, the intermediate agent is the church ("through the church"). The manifold wisdom of God displayed in the church is now revealed "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (v. 10; cf. 1:21). Although "rulers and authorities" could refer to both good and evil powers, it is probably best to understand it here as referring to evil spiritual beings who also reside "in the heavenly places."

<span id="page-60-6"></span><span id="page-60-1"></span>3:11–12 The manifold wisdom of God made known through the church to the authorities in the heavenly realms "was according to the eternal purpose" of God (cf. 1:11). In other words, the mystery hidden in the past but now revealed was God's intention from all eternity. Specifically, this plan was "realized in Christ Jesus our Lord" (3:11): the plan God purposed before all time has now been accomplished in Christ Jesus.

<span id="page-60-7"></span><span id="page-60-5"></span><span id="page-60-3"></span>Furthermore, all who put their faith in Christ can approach the Father with boldness and freedom (v. 12). Because of the believer's union with Christ ("in whom" = "in Christ"), "we have boldness and access with confidence" (v. 12; cf. 2:18). Although it is possible to view these two ideas (i.e., "boldness" and "access") as two separate concepts, it is best to view them as forming one idea. In this case, the meaning is "boldness to enter confidently" or "boldness of confident access."15 Paul emphatically declares our privileged and certain access to God (cf. Heb. 10:19).

<span id="page-60-10"></span><span id="page-60-8"></span>3:13 This section ends the way it began. In verse 1 Paul said that he was a "prisoner of Christ Jesus," and here in verse 13 he similarly writes that he is "suffering." In addition, in verse 1 he indicated his imprisonment was done "on behalf of you [*hyper hymōn*] Gentiles," and here he repeats that his tribulations are "for you" (*hyper hymōn*). Paul signals his conclusion by the use of an inferential conjunction "so" (*dio*). Based on everything Paul has just said regarding his present trials (v. 1) and unique apostolic ministry (vv. 2–12), his readers should not be discouraged.

<span id="page-60-4"></span><span id="page-60-0"></span>Although it is possible that the verb translated "ask" (v. 13) refers to a prayer to God, the ESV rightly interprets it as a request directed toward the Ephesian believers. The verb translated "lose heart" could be rendered "lose enthusiasm" or "be discouraged"16 (cf. Luke 18:1; 2 Cor. 4:1, 16; Gal. 6:9; 2 Thess. 3:13). The potential cause of the Ephesian Christians' discouragement is Paul's "suffering." Paul had been imprisoned in Rome for up to three years. It would have been natural for those who knew of his predicament to lose heart, since his calling and mission were being thwarted. Paul, however, indicates his suffering has a divine purpose—it is "for you" (cf. Col. 1:24). Paul knew his suffering was part of God's plan and would be a benefit to his readers. He concludes this section by stating that his suffering was

<sup>15</sup> O'Brien, *Ephesians*, 250.

<sup>16</sup> BDAG, s.v. ἐγκακέω (1).

<span id="page-61-2"></span>also for their "glory," which most likely refers to eternal life or salvation; although Paul's ministry had resulted in suffering for him, it would result in salvation for the Ephesian church (Eph. 1:18; Col. 1:27; 2 Tim. 2:10).

### *Response*

Before praying for his readers, Paul digresses to explain the nature of the mystery and his role in proclaiming it. This mystery was part of God's eternal plan and consists of God creating a new people of both Jew and Gentile through the work of Christ. God is sovereignly fulfilling his plan of redemption as intended from the beginning of time.

### THE CHURCH AS THE FOCUS OF GOD'S PLAN

<span id="page-61-3"></span><span id="page-61-0"></span>The NT church is not merely a parenthesis in God's plan. Rather, it was always an integral part of God's eternal purpose. The God who created all things had a plan from the beginning to make his wisdom known through the church. The old covenant temple prefigured not only Christ (John 2:21) but also his body (Eph. 2:19–21)—believers from every nation, tribe, people, and language (Rev. 7:9). The incredible mystery, hidden from previous generations, has now been revealed through the apostles and prophets—and the focus of this mystery is the church. Redeemed Jews and Gentiles, in union with their Savior, together form God's holy habitation.

### <span id="page-61-5"></span>CHRIST AS THE CENTER OF GOD'S PLAN

While God's eternal plan may focus on the church, the center or apex of that plan relates to his one and only Son, Jesus Christ. The mystery God has revealed consists first and foremost in Jesus and the reconciliation he has provided for all who believe in him. Although all of Scripture in some way anticipates the coming Messiah, this revelation was given progressively. That is, God's plan of redemption was revealed not all at once but in stages, with each stage providing more light than the previous one. Only in the NT is the full revelation of the Messiah given. The OT saints received promises concerning Jesus, but in the NT the fulfillment of those promises is revealed. The OT contains shadows and copies, but the true substance or reality is Christ (Col. 2:17; Heb. 8:5; 10:1). He is the fullest and final revelation (Heb. 1:1–2) and the center of God's perfect plan (Eph. 1:10).

### <span id="page-61-4"></span><span id="page-61-1"></span>THE UNITY OF MANKIND AS A FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PLAN

As God works his plan of redemption through his Son and creates a new humanity through his church, this new people becomes united together through their common faith. The unfolding of God's mystery reveals that Jew and Gentile have equal access to God. No longer are the Gentiles considered outsiders, alienated from God's covenant and thus without hope. Now they have equal access to the Father through the perfect work of the Son. The Mosaic law no longer separates them, for Jesus Christ is the mediator of a better covenant. Consequently, the church is made up of people from various races and cultures who all enjoy a relationship with the Father through their union with Christ.

#### THE ROLE OF SUFFERING AS PART OF GOD'S PLAN

<span id="page-62-8"></span><span id="page-62-0"></span>Finally, God's sovereign plan often involves suffering. Paul wants the Ephesian believers to see that his suffering was for their sake, and therefore he seeks to encourage them even during his imprisonment. One would expect *Paul* to be the one in need of encouragement. He was under house arrest, perhaps even chained to a Roman soldier, and facing the real possibility of death. And yet, amid his own suffering, he was faithfully proclaiming the gospel and trusting that God would use his difficult circumstances for good (cf. Phil. 1:12). Paul trusted that God's purposes were being fulfilled through his suffering. Thus he was a prisoner not of Rome but of Christ Jesus (Eph. 3:1). He does not focus on his suffering. Instead, he focuses on his role in proclaiming the gospel, which provides freedom from sin and eternal life with God. We should likewise remember that God's plan for us may involve suffering and, like Paul, we should strive to be faithful amid our trials.

The prayer Paul was set to offer in verse 1 before his digression in verses 2–13 now resumes, signaled by the repetition of "for this reason" (v. 14; cf. v. 1). The content of Paul's prayer is divided into three subsections, each introduced with "that" (*hina*; vv. 16, 17–18, 19):

<span id="page-63-8"></span>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father . . . (v. 14)

- <span id="page-63-11"></span>(1) *that* . . . he may grant you to be strengthened . . . [and] so that Christ may dwell in your hearts (vv. 16–17a)

<span id="page-63-16"></span><span id="page-63-14"></span>The doxology (vv. 20–21) contains three parts: (1) an extended description of the addressee (v. 20); (2) an extended declaration of praise (v. 21a); and (3) a phrase stating the time period during which such praise should be given (v. 21b). The doxology is also an appropriate conclusion to the first half of Paul's letter, as it marks the end of the doctrinal section (cf. Rom. 11:36) and offers a firm foundation for the ethical exhortations to follow in the second half of the letter.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-63-9"></span><span id="page-63-7"></span><span id="page-63-4"></span><span id="page-63-0"></span>3:14–15 Paul offered his first prayer in 1:15–23 and now offers a second prayer (or "prayer report") concerning his readers. "For this reason" picks up and resumes the prayer contemplated but not begun in 3:1. Paul does not use a verb to denote praying but instead uses the *posture* for praying as metonymy for the action itself (cf. Rom. 11:4; 14:11; Phil. 2:10). Although the normal posture in Jewish and early Christian prayer was standing (1 Sam. 1:26; 1 Kings 8:22; Matt. 6:5; Mark 11:25; Luke 18:11, 13), bowing or kneeling was not uncommon (1 Chron. 29:20; 2 Chron. 29:29; Ezra 9:5; Ps. 95:6; Dan. 6:10; Luke 5:8; 22:41; Acts 7:60; 20:36; 21:5). The posture of kneeling communicated humble submission and worship and was often used in prayers of utter desperation.

<span id="page-63-10"></span><span id="page-63-6"></span><span id="page-63-2"></span><span id="page-63-1"></span>Paul's prayers are specifically directed to the "Father" (cf. Eph. 1:2, 3, 17; 2:18; 4:6; 5:20; 6:23), which is expanded in verse 15 with the phrase "from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named." This term for "family" ( *patria*) occurs only two other times in the NT (Luke 2:4; Acts 3:25). The origin ("from whom") of every family or ethnic grouping is God the Father.

<span id="page-63-3"></span>When Paul says that God is the creator and sustainer of every family "in heaven," he is probably referring to various families or classifications of angels, good and evil alike, that owe their existence to God. It is best not to view such family groupings of angels as referring to actual kinship but rather as indicating classifications (such as "rulers," "authorities," "dominions," "cosmic powers," and

#### Eph esians 3:14–21 64

<span id="page-64-6"></span>"spiritual forces"; Eph. 3:10; 6:12; Col. 1:16; 2:15). God is the sovereign Creator who brought all living beings into existence, and all are dependent on him for life and significance.

<span id="page-64-8"></span><span id="page-64-0"></span>3:16–17a Paul's first request is that his readers would be strengthened. The verb form is passive, indicating this is not something they can do on their own but is something God must do in them. Paul does not use the normal verb for "strengthen" but instead uses a form that appears in only three other texts (Luke 1:80; 2:40; 1 Cor. 16:13). In his earlier prayer Paul prayed for the Ephesian Christians to have their hearts enlightened to know "the immeasurable greatness of his power" (Eph. 1:19), and here he prays that they would receive a measure of that strength and power. The strength God supplies is given "according to the riches of his glory" (3:16). The resources available to complete this petition are limitless (Phil. 4:19); God will lavishly provide all the strength the Ephesian believers need.

<span id="page-64-13"></span><span id="page-64-7"></span><span id="page-64-3"></span>The strengthening God offers is qualified with three phrases: (1) "with power," (2) "through his Spirit," and (3) "in your inner being." The first phrase provides the means by which God's strengthening occurs. The second indicates that the Spirit is the agent who carries out this strengthening. The last phrase reveals that the location of the strengthening is our "inner being" (cf. Rom. 7:22; 2 Cor. 4:16).

<span id="page-64-9"></span><span id="page-64-5"></span><span id="page-64-1"></span>The result of being strengthened by God is "that Christ may dwell in your hearts" (Eph. 3:17). Since Christ dwells in the hearts of believers from the moment of conversion, this must refer to living under the indwelling influence and continual presence of Christ. The verb "dwell" (*katoikeō*) indicates a permanent indwelling rather than a temporary residence (cf. 2:22; Col. 1:19; 2:9). "In your hearts" (Eph. 3:17) is roughly parallel to "in your inner being" (v. 16) and can be described as "the one centre in man to which God turns, in which the religious life is rooted, which determines moral conduct."17 The means by which this indwelling is attained is "through faith"—the active faith of a believer in the finished, perfect work of Christ.

<span id="page-64-10"></span><span id="page-64-2"></span>3:17b–19a Paul's second request is for the Ephesian believers to understand and experience the love of Christ. The request begins at the end of verse 17 with the phrase "being rooted and grounded in love." Paul uses both an agricultural ("rooted") and an architectural ("grounded" [or "established"]) metaphor, as he does elsewhere (2:20–22; 1 Cor. 3:9; Col. 2:7). This "love" refers not to the love of believers for one another or for God but to God's love for believers (cf. Eph. 2:4; 3:19). This love provides the basis and motivating strength that enables Christians to love others, a focus later in this letter (4:2; 5:2).

<span id="page-64-12"></span><span id="page-64-11"></span><span id="page-64-4"></span>The main thrust of this request is for the Ephesians to grasp Christ's immense love toward them. The petition consists of two interrelated requests: (1) that they "may have strength to comprehend . . . the breadth and length and height and <span id="page-65-5"></span><span id="page-65-0"></span>depth" of this love (v. 18) and thereby (2) "to know the love of Christ" (v. 19). First, believers are to comprehend the love of Christ. The dimensions listed (breadth, length, height, and depth) describe the immensity of Christ's matchless love for his people (cf. Rom. 8:35–39). This grasping of Christ's all-encompassing love is something shared with "all the saints," that is, all believers (cf. Eph. 1:1, 15; 3:8; 6:18).

<span id="page-65-6"></span><span id="page-65-4"></span><span id="page-65-2"></span>Second, believers are "to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge" (3:19). The verb "know" is virtually the same as "comprehend" (v. 18). Paradoxically, Paul prays that they would be able to "know" the love that "surpasses knowledge." He desires them to comprehend something that, because of its immensity, is beyond grasping! He is not trying to discourage his readers from attempting to comprehend the incomprehensible but rather to encourage them to meditate on the love of Christ that is so vast that they could never fully comprehend it.

<span id="page-65-7"></span>3:19b Paul now states his third main request for the Ephesian believers. It can be seen as a summary request, expressing the climactic purpose for the remainder of the prayer. He prays that they "may be filled with all the fullness of God." The word translated "with" (*eis*) is typically understood as communicating the goal (not content) to which believers are to attain. In the context, however, the idea of content is also present, especially with the verb of filling ( *plēroō*). That is, the goal or standard of the fullness they are to achieve may also imply the content of that filling. They are to be filled *up to* the fullness of God *with* the fullness of God.

<span id="page-65-12"></span><span id="page-65-3"></span>What precisely does Paul mean by "the fullness of God"? A similar text is found in 4:13, where Paul writes that believers are to attain "to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (cf. 1:23; Col. 1:19; 2:9). "Fullness" most likely denotes God's moral excellence or perfections, including his presence, life, power, and especially love. Paul is praying that his readers would comprehend Christ's love for them and that God would fill them so that they attain his perfections (especially love). This prayer, then, sets the stage for Paul's later exhortations, including his main command for the Ephesians to "walk in love" (Eph. 5:2).

<span id="page-65-13"></span><span id="page-65-11"></span><span id="page-65-10"></span><span id="page-65-9"></span><span id="page-65-8"></span><span id="page-65-1"></span>3:20–21 Paul concludes his prayer with a doxology in which he extols and praises God (cf. Rom. 16:25–27; Phil. 4:20; 1 Tim. 1:17; Jude 24–25). The doxology contains three parts: (1) a description of the addressee (Eph. 3:20); (2) a declaration of praise (v. 21a); and (3) a temporal expression of how long such praise should be given (v. 21b). The first part begins with Paul addressing God as the powerful one who can accomplish more than what his people could even imagine. The power of God is emphasized with the terms (1) "him who is able" (which could be rendered "him who is *powerful* [*dynamai* ]"), (2) "power" (*dynamis*), and (3) "work" (*energeō*). God is not only powerful (and willing) enough to do more "than all that we ask or think" (v. 20); he is able to do even *more* (lit., "above all things"). But Paul does not stop there. He adds that God is able to do "far more abundantly" than what we could even imagine. Here Paul uses a rare adjective (*hyperekperissou*) that means "quite beyond all measure" and communicates "the highest form of comparison

<span id="page-66-6"></span>imaginable."18 After this bold prayer, one might perhaps wonder if Paul dared to ask too much. But Paul indicates clearly with this doxology that such a prayer is not impossible for God to answer. Even more stunning is that God uses his power to bless and aid his people. God works "according to the power at work within us" (v. 20). This is the same power that raised Jesus from the dead and exalted him to the Father's right hand, above all other powers (1:20–21). Such a statement, then, offers assurance to the readers that the blessings God has promised his people (1:3–14) will be fulfilled.

<span id="page-66-7"></span><span id="page-66-2"></span><span id="page-66-0"></span>The second part of the doxology (3:21a) is a declaration of praise in which God is ascribed glory. To give glory to God is not to give him something he does not already possess, but to praise him for who he is and what he has done. Specifically, this "glory" is said to be "in the church" and "in Christ Jesus." God's glory is seen in the church through its identity as a multiracial community of Jews and Gentiles (2:11–22), which testifies of God's manifold wisdom (3:10). In addition, God's glory is revealed in Christ Jesus. The mention of Christ after reference to the church demonstrates their close connection (1:3–14, 22–23; 2:13, 14–17, 18–19, 20–22): God's glory in Jesus Christ cannot be separated from his glory revealed in the church.

<span id="page-66-8"></span><span id="page-66-4"></span><span id="page-66-3"></span>The final part of the doxology is the temporal expression of how long such praise should be given ("throughout all generations, forever and ever"; 3:21b). Literally the phrase means "to all the generations of the age of the ages," but it should be understood as indicating eternity. Our praise of God's glory should be without end. As he often does, Paul ends the doxology with "Amen," a transliteration of the Hebrew equivalent that indicates a "strong affirmation of what is stated" and can be translated as "let it be so," "truly."19 This doxology marks the end of the first half of the letter.

### *Response*

<span id="page-66-1"></span>Paul once again prays for his readers, building on his previous prayer (1:15–23). He expands his prayer and asks that his readers (1) be strengthened by God's power, (2) understand Christ's love, and (3) be filled with God's fullness.

#### PRAY TO BE STRENGTHENED BY GOD'S POWER

<span id="page-66-12"></span><span id="page-66-10"></span><span id="page-66-5"></span>By nature, we tend to think that we are powerful in and of ourselves. But time and time again we are reminded in Scripture that the power to serve God and defeat sin in our lives comes only from the strength and grace God provides (vv. 16–17). Paul testifies, "I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord" (1 Tim. 1:12). While in prison, when everyone else has abandoned him, he says, "The Lord stood by me and strengthened me" (2 Tim. 4:17). He encourages his protégé Timothy by exhorting him to "be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus" (2 Tim. 2:1). And later in Ephesians he will instruct his readers to "be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might" (Eph. 6:10). Because God is the one who strengthens us, he receives the glory (1 Pet. 4:11). In order to resist

the influence of the Evil One effectively, flee from sin, pursue the virtues of Christ, live gospel-centered lives, and take the good news of the gospel to the ends of the earth, we must rely on God's strength and not our own.

### PRAY TO UNDERSTAND CHRIST'S LOVE

<span id="page-67-5"></span><span id="page-67-2"></span>Paul also prays for the Ephesian Christians to "have strength to comprehend" (Eph. 3:18) and "know" (v. 19) the love Christ has for his people. It is a love that cannot be measured, for it has no limits. God is not only powerful; he is also loving. Paul earlier reminds us that before God created the heavens and the earth, he chose us "in love" (1:4–5). Even though we were dead in our trespasses and sins, God made us alive "because of the great love with which he loved us" (2:4). God's love is so amazing that it surpasses our ability to comprehend it fully, yet Paul prays for his readers to come to an increasingly greater understanding of this love. God's great power ensures that his love will never fail.

### <span id="page-67-3"></span>PRAY TO BE FILLED WITH GOD'S FULLNESS

<span id="page-67-8"></span><span id="page-67-6"></span><span id="page-67-4"></span><span id="page-67-0"></span>Finally, Paul prays that his readers "may be filled with all the fullness of God" (Eph. 3:19). In the OT, God's presence filled the tabernacle and then the temple. Earlier Paul explained that both Jew and Gentile believers are "a holy temple in the Lord" (2:21; cf. 1 Cor. 3:16–17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16). Paul also prayed that "Christ may dwell in your hearts" (Eph. 3:17). God now resides in and with us. We have immediate access, for he is always present. Therefore he desires that we would be a holy habitation, and so we are commanded "to put off your old self" (4:22). In order to be filled with God's fullness and to experience his power and love, we must be a holy habitation for him to indwell.

### EPHESIANS 4:1–6

4I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, **2**with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, **<sup>3</sup>** eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. **4**There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call— **<sup>5</sup>** one Lord, one faith, one baptism, **<sup>6</sup>** one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-67-7"></span><span id="page-67-1"></span>Whereas chapters 1–3 focused on the doctrinal foundation of Paul's message to the Ephesians, chapters 4–6 shift to the practical application or exhortations based

#### Eph esians 4:1–6 68

<span id="page-68-4"></span><span id="page-68-3"></span>on that foundation, signaled by "therefore" (4:1). Up to this point Paul has used only one imperative ("remember"; 2:11), but in chapters 4–6 we'll find thirty-nine imperatives.

<span id="page-68-5"></span>This section (4:1–6) consists of two parts (vv. 1–3 and 4–6), each focusing on the unity believers have with one another. The main verbal expression, "I . . . urge you to walk in a manner worthy" (v. 1), is modified by two prepositional phrases ("with all humility and gentleness, with patience") communicating the manner in which believers are to walk. In addition, two clauses communicate the means by which believers are to walk: (1) "bearing with one another in love" (v. 2) and (2) "eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (v. 3). The verb "walk" ( *peripateō*) is prominent in the second half of this letter (4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15; cf. 2:2, 10).

<span id="page-68-8"></span><span id="page-68-6"></span><span id="page-68-2"></span>In 4:4–6 Paul either composes or contextualizes a confession of faith that again emphasizes the unity believers possess, using a sevenfold repetition of "one." These verses provide the basis of believers' unity, which is grounded in the unity of God ("one Spirit . . . one Lord . . . one God and Father of all"), the people of God (one body), and the church's response to God ("one hope . . . one faith, one baptism").

- B. The Basis of Unity (4:4–6)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-68-1"></span><span id="page-68-0"></span>4:1 Paul begins the second half of Ephesians with a general exhortation to live a life worthy of our calling. The conjunction "therefore" refers back to the entire first half of the letter (chs. 1–3), providing the theological foundation for the ethical injunctions to follow (cf. Rom. 12:1; Col. 3:1; 1 Thess. 4:1). Paul further identifies himself as "a prisoner for [or "in"] the Lord," which adds emphasis and authority to the following exhortation. The main thrust of this entire section is found in the phrase "I . . . urge you to walk."

<span id="page-68-9"></span>Paul strongly appeals to the Ephesian believers "to walk in a manner worthy of the calling" to which they were called. The theme of "walking" continues throughout the letter (cf. Eph. 4:17; 5:2, 8, 15) and is a metaphor for one's conduct or way of life. Believers have the obligation and duty to live in accord with their calling. But notice the order here: behavior is always subsequent to being born again. Or, to put it differently, conduct always follows calling. It is only after the experience of new life or regeneration that God's people are able to follow his commands faithfully and worthily. The phrase "you have been called" contains a divine passive, indicating that God is the one who sovereignly calls. The repetition of the idea of calling ("the *calling* to which you have been *called*") emphasizes its importance.

<span id="page-68-7"></span>4:2–3 These verses expand on the previous verse by identifying the manner and means by which believers are to "walk in a manner worthy of [their] calling." First, Paul lists three virtues describing the manner (i.e., the attitudes) in which we are to walk: "with all humility and gentleness, with patience" (v. 2). The first two virtues ("humility and gentleness") are closely related, as Paul does not repeat the preposition "with" as he does before the third virtue. In addition, the use of "all" underscores the importance and necessity of those two ethical qualities. In light of the emphasis on unity in this section, Paul stresses the need for humility, since pride is destructive of community life. Indeed, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" (1 Pet. 5:5, citing Prov. 3:34). Paul lists "gentleness" as one of the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:23) and emphasizes that it is needed when restoring someone who has sinned (Gal. 6:1) or correcting someone who is in error (2 Tim. 2:25).

<span id="page-69-18"></span><span id="page-69-7"></span><span id="page-69-6"></span><span id="page-69-5"></span><span id="page-69-1"></span><span id="page-69-0"></span>The third virtue, "patience," is a characteristic of God mentioned repeatedly in the Bible (e.g., Ex. 34:6). His patience is what leads us to repentance (Rom. 2:4), as he wants no one to perish (2 Pet. 3:9). Patience is a fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22–23), a defining quality of love (1 Cor. 13:4), and a characteristic Christians are to display to one another (Col. 3:12; 1 Thess. 5:14; 2 Tim. 4:2).

<span id="page-69-15"></span><span id="page-69-11"></span><span id="page-69-4"></span><span id="page-69-3"></span>Paul also includes the means by which believers are to conduct their lives. First, walking in a manner worthy of our calling is done by "bearing with one another in love" (Eph. 4:2). The verb translated "bearing" (*anechō*) is often used in contexts of enduring persecution or suffering (1 Cor. 4:12; 2 Cor. 11:20; 2 Thess. 1:4). But Paul is not simply suggesting that believers *tolerate* each other. Rather, he adds that we must bear with each other "in love" (i.e., lovingly; cf. Col. 3:13).

<span id="page-69-20"></span><span id="page-69-19"></span><span id="page-69-17"></span><span id="page-69-16"></span><span id="page-69-12"></span>Second, walking in a manner worthy of our calling requires us to be "eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit" (Eph. 4:3). "Eager" adds a sense of urgency to Paul's appeal. Normally, this term (*spoudazō*) is used by Paul to communicate the intense effort and labor involved in making a trip or journey (1 Thess. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:9, 21; Titus 3:12) and is also used by Peter to designate earnest effort (2 Pet. 1:10; 3:14). Notice that Paul is not exhorting his readers to *create* unity but rather to *maintain* the unity that already exists because of the finished work of Christ (cf. Eph. 2:11–22). This "unity" (cf. 4:13) is something that comes from or is produced by the Holy Spirit. Believers are exhorted to maintain the unity secured by Christ and given by the Spirit. Finally, this unity is established in or by "the bond of peace." That which binds Christians together is nothing other than peace itself.

<span id="page-69-14"></span><span id="page-69-13"></span><span id="page-69-10"></span><span id="page-69-9"></span><span id="page-69-8"></span><span id="page-69-2"></span>4:4–6 After summoning his readers to walk in unity, Paul now provides the grounds or theological basis for that unity through the sevenfold repetition of "one." First, Paul writes that there is "one body" (v. 4)—a reference to the church as the body of Christ (1:22–23). Paul mentions this reality first because it is his primary concern (2:16). This phrase is used several other times by Paul as a reference to the church (Rom. 12:4–5; 1 Cor. 12:12–13, 20; Col. 3:15). Although there are many members of the church, with individually different gifts, together they form one body.

<span id="page-70-7"></span><span id="page-70-6"></span>Second, Paul adds that there is "one Spirit" (Eph. 4:4; cf. 1 Cor. 12:11; 12:13). Up to this point in Ephesians, Paul has indicated that believers (1) are sealed with the Spirit (Eph. 1:13), (2) have access to the Father through the Spirit (2:18), (3) are a dwelling place for God by the Spirit (2:22), (4) are strengthened in the inner man through the Spirit (3:16), and (5) are graced with the unity of the Spirit (4:3).

<span id="page-70-9"></span><span id="page-70-8"></span>Third, believers are called to "one hope" (4:4). The expression Paul uses here breaks with the pattern he has established. Instead of merely proclaiming that there is "one hope," he makes a comparison with his previous statements: just as there is one body and one Spirit, similarly there is one hope, which accompanied our call. The "hope" to which Paul refers is not the subjective feeling of a confident expectation, but its content.

<span id="page-70-5"></span>Fourth, there is "one Lord" (v. 5), which clearly refers to Jesus Christ, since Paul mentioned the Spirit in verse 4 and will mention God the Father in verse 6 (cf. 1 Cor. 8:6). The claim that Jesus alone is Lord served as a polemic against Caesar or the cult of Artemis in Ephesus, both of which were called "lord" in that culture (cf. Rom. 10:9; 1 Cor. 12:3; Phil. 2:11). This declaration also identifies Jesus with the God of the Jewish Scriptures: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Deut. 6:4).

<span id="page-70-10"></span><span id="page-70-4"></span><span id="page-70-0"></span>Fifth, there is "one faith" (Eph. 4:5). The referent of "faith" here is not the subjective act or attitude of believing but the objective content of that which is believed (cf. 4:13; Rom. 10:8; Gal. 1:23; 3:23; Col. 1:23; 2:7; 1 Tim. 3:9; 4:1, 6).

<span id="page-70-3"></span><span id="page-70-2"></span>Sixth, there is "one baptism" (Eph. 4:5; cf. Rom. 6:4). Although many commentators attempt to determine whether Paul is stressing water baptism or Spirit baptism, the two cannot be separated in the apostle's thinking. As F. F. Bruce explains, "It is beside the point to ask whether it is baptism in water or the baptism of the Spirit: it is Christian baptism—baptism 'into the name of the Lord Jesus' (Acts 8:16; 19:5; cf. 1 Cor. 1:13–15)—which indeed involved the application of water . . . , but . . . was closely associated with the gift of the Spirit."20

<span id="page-70-11"></span><span id="page-70-1"></span>Last, Paul climactically concludes the sevenfold basis of unity by declaring that there is "one God and Father of all" (Eph. 4:6). Again, Paul's statement is reminiscent of Deuteronomy 6:4. In this verse, Paul affirms God's "supreme transcendence" (he is "over all") as well as his "pervasive immanence" (he is "through all and in all").21 Although it is not clear whether the repeated use of "all" refers to (1) all believers or (2) all of creation, the latter seems more likely. Paul is declaring God's supreme sovereignty, omnipotence, and presence in his creation. Finally, it should be noted that the divine Trinity is central to Paul's discussion on unity. The *Spirit* is linked with the one body or church, which is called to one hope. The *Lord* is linked with the one faith the church professes and the one baptism it receives. Finally, *God the Father* is the one who supremely rules over all his creation and yet is intimately involved in it, working in and through all things.

### *Response*

#### THE NEED FOR UNITY

<span id="page-71-0"></span>Unity is not an option for believers. It is essential to the very message we proclaim. The gospel declares the good news that, through Jesus, God has provided a way of reconciliation with himself. When we do not display to one another the peace that God brings, our message is compromised. The unity of believers impacts our testimony to the world (John 17:22–23). Paul, therefore, strongly urges us to "to walk in a manner worthy" of our calling (Eph. 4:1). We fulfill this command by seeking to "maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (v. 3). Unity is not an add-on to Christianity. It is at the very heart of our faith.

#### <span id="page-71-2"></span><span id="page-71-1"></span>THE VIRTUES OF UNITY

Paul emphasizes the need to walk with humility, gentleness, patience, tolerance, love, and peace. Each of these attributes is essential to maintaining unity in the church. Humility is needed because pride insists on getting its own way. Gentleness is needed because anger offends and harms others. Patience is needed because we cannot control the actions of others, including God. Tolerance is needed because everyone has weaknesses. Love is needed because it is the oil that lubricates all the other virtues. And peace is needed because unity cannot truly exist without God's people being united by the peace that surpasses all understanding (Phil. 4:7).

#### <span id="page-71-3"></span>THE BASIS OF UNITY

Finally, we should note the basis of unity. Although people today often attempt to establish unity based on the principle of unity itself, the unity Paul hopes to maintain in the church is based on the sevenfold unity mentioned in this text. Only a unity theologically grounded in the reality of the triune God and his gospel will be able to survive attacks from without and pressure from within.

### EPHESIANS 4:7–16

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-72-7"></span><span id="page-72-5"></span><span id="page-72-4"></span>This section is linked to the previous one (4:1–6) by the theme of "unity" (4:3, 13). Yet this section (esp. vv. 7–10) stresses *diversity* amid such unity for the purpose of building up the body of Christ. The two major divisions of this section (vv. 7–10 and 11–16) are framed by the similar expression "to each one" (v. 7) and "each part" (v. 16). This structure highlights the theme of the diversity of gifts for the building up of the corporate community.

<span id="page-72-11"></span><span id="page-72-6"></span><span id="page-72-0"></span>The first portion of the passage (vv. 7–10) contains an assertion that Christ has given grace or gifts to each individual believer (v. 7), followed by a quote from Psalm 68:18 and a brief explanation or interpretation of the quote. In the second half of the passage (vv. 11–16) the grace that Christ gives is expressed in terms of various types of leaders: apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers (v. 11). The reason these officers are given is to "equip the saints for the work of ministry," which will result in "building up the body of Christ" (v. 12). The remainder of this passage (vv. 13–16) explains three purposes for which Christ gave gifts to the church.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-72-3"></span><span id="page-72-2"></span><span id="page-72-1"></span>4:7 This verse marks a transition in Paul's thought from the theme of unity to the theme of diversity within unity. In particular, the focus is on Christ's role in sovereignly gifting individual believers for the greater good of the church. Paul notes that "grace was given to each one of us." This "grace" (*charis*) is not saving or sanctifying grace, but ministry grace. Elsewhere Paul uses "gift" (*charisma*) to refer to that which is given to believers for corporate service and edification (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4). This grace is specifically given "to each one of us" (Eph. 4:7; cf. Rom. 12:3; 1 Cor. 12:7, 11; 1 Pet. 4:10). In Ephesians 4:4–6 "one" was used in reference

to the sevenfold unity, and here it underscores that each member ought to be a contributor and participant in that unity through his use of the gifts given to him. These gifts are based not on the believers' works or merit but "according to the measure of Christ's gift." Christ graciously and sovereignly distributes gifts to every member of his body.

<span id="page-73-5"></span><span id="page-73-0"></span>4:8 Paul now cites the OT (Ps. 68:18) to provide the support or grounds for the claim made in verse 7 (cf. James 4:6). By using the present tense ("Therefore it *says*"), Paul is indicating that the Scriptures, although spoken (or written) in the past, still speak today and are therefore relevant and binding on believers. Paul's citation, however, is different from both the Hebrew Masoretic Text and the Greek Septuagint:

You ascended to the high places, you captured captives, you received gifts from mankind. (Ps. 68:18 LXX)

<span id="page-73-1"></span>When he ascended to the high places, he captured captives, he gave gifts to men. (Eph. 4:8)22

Paul is true to the original meaning of the Psalm while also adding a Christological interpretation. In the original context, God is the Divine Warrior who ascends to his throne after defeating his enemies. Here, Christ is the victorious conqueror who ascends to his throne in heaven after defeating the spiritual forces. Instead of receiving gifts (i.e., the spoils of war) from those vanquished, Christ (having conquered his enemies by defeating death) sovereignly gives gifts to his followers.

<span id="page-73-3"></span><span id="page-73-2"></span>4:9–10 These two verses provide an explanation or inspired commentary on Psalm 68:18 (cf. Eph. 4:8) and thus function as a parenthetical comment. Paul begins by repeating part of the citation ("He ascended"; v. 9) in order to draw attention to the meaning and implication of the phrase. In particular, he infers from Christ's ascension a previous descent. The expression that Christ has "descended into the lower regions, the earth" has been the center of much debate. There are three main interpretations: (1) *Jesus' descent to Hades*: After his death but before his resurrection, Jesus went to Hades to liberate OT saints or to offer the dead a chance to hear the gospel, repent, and be set free (1 Pet. 3:19 is cited in support of this view). (2) *Jesus' incarnation (and death)*: The "lower regions" refer to the earth (as opposed to the heavens). Thus, Jesus' descent to the earth is another way of referring to the incarnation. (3) *Jesus' Spirit at Pentecost*: Christ's descent occurred through his Spirit at Pentecost. Of these three views, the second is the most likely, primarily because it has the fewest difficulties and best fits the context of Ephesians.

<span id="page-73-6"></span>It should be noted, however, that Paul's primary concern is not with Christ's descent but with his ascension. The very one "who descended is the one who also ascended" (Eph. 4:10). Specifically, he ascended "far above all the heavens," a sign

<span id="page-73-4"></span><sup>22</sup> Translations of both the LXX and the Greek NT are the author's.

<span id="page-74-5"></span><span id="page-74-4"></span>of his exalted status (1:21). Finally, the stated goal of Christ's ascension is "that he might fill all things" (cf. 1:23). Christ fills the entire universe through the exercise of his divine lordship over all things.

<span id="page-74-8"></span><span id="page-74-7"></span>4:11 Paul expands upon his comments in verses 7–8 concerning the conquering and sovereign Christ's gracious gifts to each believer. Interestingly, the gifts given by Christ here are not spiritual gifts but the persons themselves, given for the unity and maturity of the church: "He gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers." Other NT lists containing spiritual gifts are found in Romans 12:6–8; 1 Corinthians 12:8–10, 28–30; and 1 Peter 4:10–11. The gifts listed across the NT total more than 20, and each list is different and therefore incomplete. Each list simply illustrates certain gifts relevant to the particular context.

<span id="page-74-10"></span><span id="page-74-6"></span><span id="page-74-3"></span><span id="page-74-2"></span><span id="page-74-1"></span>Paul lists four different types of individuals who are gifted by Christ and given to the church. First, the Lord has given apostles (cf. comment on 1:1). Next, prophets—not OT prophets but those alive during Paul's time who spoke God's truth to the church (Eph. 3:5; Acts 11:27–28; 15:32; 21:10–11; 1 Cor. 14:24–25; cf. comment on Eph. 2:20). Third, he has given evangelists. "Evangelist" occurs only two other times in the NT, describing Philip in Acts 21:8 and Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:5. Thielman maintains that evangelists "are probably those whom God has especially equipped to travel from place to place with the good news of peace through Christ."23 This description would apply to both Philip (who traveled around preaching the gospel; Acts 8:4–5, 35, 40) and Timothy (who was only temporarily in Ephesus and would soon be traveling again; 2 Tim. 4:9, 21). The final two terms, "shepherds" (or "pastors") and "teachers," are best seen not as two distinct groups but as overlapping. "Pastors" should be seen as a subset of "teachers," because all pastors teach but not all teachers are also pastors. Thus Paul is referring to those who teach but who also have the added duty of shepherding God's people. This is the only place in the NT where "pastor" is applied to someone who holds a ministry position in the church.

<span id="page-74-11"></span><span id="page-74-9"></span><span id="page-74-0"></span>4:12 Paul now explains why Christ has given leaders to the church. This verse has been the center of considerable debate, as there is some ambiguity concerning how to punctuate the three prepositional phrases. For example, the KJV places a comma after each phrase so that they are viewed as coordinate or parallel. In this reading, Christ gave various ministers to the church in order to accomplish three things: "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ" (KJV). The problem with this rendering is that it could support the misunderstanding that the leaders, not the saints, do the ministry. Nearly all modern English versions and commentators, however, interpret the second phrase as dependent on the first and the third phrase as dependent on the first two. Consequently, Christ gives leaders who equip the saints, and it is the *saints* who do the work of the ministry (and

<sup>23</sup> Thielman, *Ephesians*, 274.

not merely the leaders). Such a reading is supported by the Greek text, which uses two different prepositions to mark this distinction,24 as well as the context, with its emphasis on gifts given "to each one" (v. 7) so that "each part" (v. 16) does its work.

<span id="page-75-3"></span>This interpretation has important ramifications for the function of church leadership and the nature of ministry. The ministry is not just for a select few who are paid to work by and for everyone else. Instead, God gifts leaders for the task of equipping all the saints to do the work of service. Next, Paul adds that the goal of the saints' being equipped for service is for "building up the body of Christ." Because "building up" refers figuratively to the spiritual strengthening of believers, and also because of the following context of spiritual maturity, this term is best understood primarily in a qualitative (growth in maturity) and not quantitative (growth in numbers) sense. The ultimate goal of Christ's gifting the church with leaders is for his body, the church, to become spiritually mature.

4:13 After clearly stating the purpose of church leaders, Paul then affirms that the building up of Christ's church is needed "until we all attain" a certain maturity, which is spelled out with parallel statements:

- to [*eis*] the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
- to [*eis*] mature manhood,
- to [*eis*] the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,

<span id="page-75-6"></span><span id="page-75-2"></span><span id="page-75-1"></span>First, God's people should attain to "the unity of the faith" and "[the unity] of the knowledge of the Son of God" (cf. v. 3). "Faith" in this context refers to the objective content of what is believed (cf. v. 5). That is, believers should be in agreement concerning the apostolic teaching found in the Bible (Jude 3). Similarly, the "knowledge" of God's Son refers to those truths about Jesus that are essential for all believers to affirm. Biblical unity must be founded on the objective truth-claims of Jesus. Second, God's people should attain to "mature manhood." Although this phrase could refer to individual believers, more likely it carries the corporate idea of the church (Eph. 2:15). Third, God's desire is for his people to attain to "the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." The goal for believers is to reach the maturity that Christ himself attained.

<span id="page-75-5"></span><span id="page-75-0"></span>4:14 Paul now states negatively the intended results of Christ's gifts of leadership to the church. Specifically, it is "so that we may no longer be children." In the NT, "children/infants" (*nēpioi* ) can denote physical children or, as in the present context, a childlike gullibility and lack of experiential knowledge. Thus "children" is used metaphorically to refer to spiritually immature believers, starkly contrasting with the mature man of verse 13. Paul then moves from imagery of human development to a storm at sea. Those who are immature are "tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about." This seafaring imagery again highlights lack of maturity, as such people have little ability to defend themselves against wind and waves.

<span id="page-75-4"></span><sup>24</sup> The ESV accurately reflects this distinction in English: "to [*pros*] equip the saints for [*eis*] the work of ministry, for [*eis*] building up the body of Christ."

Paul next mentions three ways in which immature believers are tossed and blown. First, they are tossed and blown "by every wind of doctrine," most likely a reference to false doctrine. Second, they are tossed and blown "by human cunning," which probably involves trickery. Third, they are tossed and blown "by craftiness in deceitful schemes." In light of these dangers, believers are encouraged to be firmly grounded in the apostolic teaching so that they may develop and grow into mature followers of Christ.

<span id="page-76-4"></span>4:15–16 In contrast to those who cause harm to immature believers through cunning and deceitful schemes, believers are to speak "the truth," which includes honest speech in general and also speaking or confessing the truth of the gospel. Such speaking must be done not with callousness or cold-heartedness but "in love." The desired goal of such action is for believers "to grow up in every way into him." Christians are called to maturity and are not to remain children in their faith (Heb. 5:12–6:1). Their goal is to become more like their Savior. At the same time, however, there must always be a distinction between Christ and his people. He is "the head." Therefore, Christ is the one who leads the church and nourishes it by supplying everything needed for growth.

<span id="page-76-6"></span><span id="page-76-5"></span><span id="page-76-2"></span>In Ephesians 4:16 Paul further clarifies the fact that Christ is the source of the church's growth ("from whom" = from Christ). He describes the "whole body" as being "joined and held together by every joint." The last phrase ("every joint") most likely serves as a metaphor for all believers, not just the gifted leaders referenced in verse 11. God gifts believers so that they, having been empowered, may use their gifts for the benefit of others and the common good. The end result is that the body will grow—not just numerically but also in maturity. Finally, Paul adds that this growth must be closely related to "love," the essential lifeblood of the body.

### *Response*

### THE CONQUERING AND ASCENDED CHRIST GIFTS EVERY BELIEVER

<span id="page-76-1"></span>Paul begins this passage by affirming that Christ has gifted "each one" (4:7). That is, every believer has been graced with spiritual gifts by the resurrected and ascended Christ. These gifts are not chosen by us but are sovereignly distributed by the risen Lord, for he has conquered his enemies and ascended to the place of supreme authority. This also means that not everyone has the same level of gifts: some might be more gifted than others for particular ministries (Rom. 12:3–8). Yet, because these are "gifts," there is no room for pride or arrogance but merely humble service in acknowledgment of what has been given.

#### <span id="page-76-0"></span>LEADERS ARE ALSO GIVEN TO THE CHURCH TO EQUIP THE SAINTS

<span id="page-76-3"></span>Every believer is gifted, but only some receive gifts commensurate with leadership in Christ's church. Paul specifically mentions apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers. Interestingly, each of these leaders primarily possesses gifts of utterance. Their primary ministry is speaking or teaching God's Word, which is vital for the unity and maturity of God's people (Eph. 4:13–14). Gifts of teaching <span id="page-77-4"></span><span id="page-77-3"></span>are also emphasized in the qualifications of overseers (elders). In 1 Timothy 3:2, such leaders must be "able to teach," and in Titus 1:9 they must be "able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it."

<span id="page-77-0"></span>The task of church leaders is to "equip the saints for the work of ministry" (Eph. 4:12). Their goal is not simply to do the work of ministry but rather to equip all believers to somehow participate in ministry. This passage strongly supports the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers, which teaches that there is no special status of priest among Christians; *all* are called as priests to serve God. The professionalization of the ministry, however, threatens this important doctrinal commitment. There is often the feeling that the paid staff (the professionals) should do the work of the ministry and the laity should be served by them. Paul's (and God's) vision for the church is different. Leaders equip the church to carry out the work of ministry effectively.

<span id="page-77-1"></span>MUTUAL SERVICE AMONG THE SAINTS LEADS TO MATURITY OF THE BODY When only a few gifted leaders do the work of the ministry, churches might grow in numbers but not in depth of maturity. The primary goal of the ministry is to build up the body of Christ so that every member attains to the "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (v. 13). The goal is Christlikeness. When only a few people serve the church, such a goal is difficult. But when the leaders actively equip the other members to serve, such a goal is within reach.

### EPHESIANS 4:17–24

**<sup>17</sup>**Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. **18**They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. **19**They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. **20**But that is not the way you learned Christ!— **<sup>21</sup>** assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, **<sup>22</sup>** to put off your old self,*<sup>1</sup>* which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, **<sup>23</sup>** and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, **<sup>24</sup>** and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-77-2"></span>This section consists of two halves in which Paul exhorts the Ephesian believers to live not as unbelieving Gentiles (Eph. 4:17–19) but in light of the new person <span id="page-78-13"></span><span id="page-78-3"></span>(vv. 20–24; cf. Col. 3:9–10). The main idea of the first half is found in the declaration, "This I say and testify . . . that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do." The verb "walk" signals a return to the exhortation begun in Ephesians 4:1, resuming the call to faithful Christian living. The undesirable lifestyle of the Gentiles is then described in three negative phrases: (1) "They are darkened" (v. 18); (2) "[They are] alienated" (v. 18); and (3) "They have become callous" (v. 19).

<span id="page-78-11"></span><span id="page-78-10"></span><span id="page-78-9"></span><span id="page-78-8"></span><span id="page-78-5"></span>The main idea of the second half (vv. 20–24) is found in the three verbs "you learned" (v. 20), "you have heard" (v. 21), and, especially, "[you] were taught" (v. 21). This last verb is complemented by three verbs indicating precisely what the Ephesian Christians were taught: "to put off" (v. 22), "to be renewed" (v. 23), and "to put on" (v. 24).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-78-4"></span>4:17 Paul now resumes the thought of the initial appeal to walk worthy of our calling (4:1). The seriousness of Paul's appeal is found both in the addition of the verb "testify" and in his use of the prepositional phrase "in the Lord," which communicates the source of Paul's authority. As a "prisoner for the Lord" (4:1), Paul is not urging the Ephesian believers on his own initiative. His authority comes from the Lord.

<span id="page-78-2"></span>Although his readers are converted Gentiles living in a Gentile context, Paul urges them to "no longer walk as the Gentiles do." They must abandon the lifestyle they once embraced as unconverted Gentiles (2:1–3). Again, Paul uses the word "walk" to characterize the features of one's daily lifestyle. He first says that they should not walk "in the futility of their minds." "Futility" (*mataiotēs*) is sometimes translated as "meaninglessness" and is used extensively in Ecclesiastes to describe life apart from the fear of God (LXX Eccles. 1:2, 14; 2:1, 11, 15, 17, 19). Similarly, Paul in Romans writes of those who knew God but did not honor or give thanks to God and so "became futile in their thinking" (Rom. 1:21).

<span id="page-78-7"></span><span id="page-78-6"></span><span id="page-78-1"></span><span id="page-78-0"></span>4:18–19 Paul further depicts the negative condition of Gentiles apart from Christ. First (v. 18a), Paul maintains that the understanding of unregenerate Gentiles is

<span id="page-79-2"></span><span id="page-79-0"></span>darkened. This picture corresponds with their plight as characterized by Paul in Romans 1:21: "Their foolish hearts were darkened." In the Septuagint, "understanding" and "heart" were often used interchangeably for the center of human perception (Gen. 8:21; 17:17; 24:45; 27:41; Ex. 28:3). Note the contrast between the darkness of unbelievers with the enlightenment given to believers (cf. Eph. 1:17–18).

<span id="page-79-6"></span><span id="page-79-5"></span><span id="page-79-4"></span><span id="page-79-1"></span>Second (4:18b), unbelieving Gentiles are characterized as "alienated from the life of God" (cf. 2:12). Apart from the life that comes from God, they are dead in their trespasses and sins (2:1, 5). The reason for this distressing state is then named: "because of the ignorance that is in them." This represents a willful, culpable ignorance of God (Rom. 1:19–21; 1 Thess. 4:5), and it is "due to their hardness of heart" (Eph. 4:18b). To have a hard heart is to be obstinate or insensible. F. F. Bruce defines the hardening of Gentile hearts as "the progressive inability of conscience to convict them of wrongdoing."25

<span id="page-79-8"></span><span id="page-79-7"></span><span id="page-79-3"></span>Third (v. 19), Paul describes these Gentiles as those who "have become callous." This verb occurs only here in the NT and means "to lose the capacity to feel shame or embarrassment."26 Because they have become callous or dead of feeling, the unsaved "have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity." The reflexive pronoun "themselves" indicates that the Gentiles' own initiative drove them to immorality (cf. Rom. 1:24, 26, 28, where God gives people over to their sins). The word translated "sensuality" means "lack of self-constraint which involves one in conduct that violates all bounds of what is socially acceptable,"27 and "it is probably best understood as undisciplined behavior especially, though not exclusively, of a sexual nature."28 Unconverted pagans also practice "impurity." Although this term includes unrestrained sexual behavior, it cannot be restricted to such meaning, for the text mentions "every kind of impurity." Never satisfied, the unregenerate are "greedy to practice" such deviant behavior. Christians should avoid such a lifestyle because it is characteristic of those apart from Christ, who remain under the wrath of God.

<span id="page-79-11"></span><span id="page-79-10"></span><span id="page-79-9"></span>4:20–21 In sharp contrast to the mind-set and lifestyle of unbelieving Gentiles, Paul reminds his audience that they have learned a far different way. He writes, "But that is not the way you learned Christ!" (v. 20). Paul's language here is a bit unusual. Normally, one learns a particular content (e.g., doctrine, rules, attributes) or behavior (e.g., love, respect, do good), not a *person* (cf. Col. 2:6–7). O'Brien suggests that the idea of learning Christ "means welcoming him as a living person and being shaped by his teaching," with the result of "submitting to his rule of righteousness and responding to his summons to standards and values completely different from what they have known."29

<span id="page-80-7"></span><span id="page-80-6"></span>Paul then expresses a confident assumption that his readers "heard" about Christ through the proclamation of the gospel and "were taught" about him through the apostolic teaching (Eph. 4:21). These two verbs further explain what was involved in learning Christ (v. 20). The text literally says that they "have heard him," which could mean that they heard Christ through the voice of their teachers. It is better, however, to interpret the phrase to mean they heard *about* Christ (so ESV, NRSV, NIV). He is the content of Christian teaching, with the goal of relational knowledge of him (Phil. 3:10). Finally, the Ephesians were taught in Christ just "as the truth is in Jesus" (Eph. 4:21). In contrast to the Gentiles' pattern of thinking and living, believers have been instructed in accordance with the truth, which can be found only in Jesus.

<span id="page-80-12"></span><span id="page-80-9"></span>4:22–24 Paul mentions three specific areas in which the Ephesian believers have been taught, and, once again, exhorts them to put what they have learned into practice. Although the three verbs conveying this message are not imperatives (i.e., commands), they do carry an imperatival force.

<span id="page-80-4"></span><span id="page-80-1"></span>First (v. 22), the believers were taught "to put off your old self." The verb Paul uses (*apotithēmi* ) is often used for taking off one's clothes but is used figuratively here for putting off or laying aside sin (cf. Rom. 13:12; Col. 3:8). "Old self" refers to the former, unregenerate person. The apostle further describes this old self as that "which belongs to your former manner of life," which was earlier characterized as living according to "the passions of our flesh" (Eph. 2:3). This old self is also "corrupt through deceitful desires," that is, sinful passions that ruin and destroy the unbeliever. Such desires stand in opposition to God and his gospel. Therefore, Paul reminds his readers not to be ruled by the person they once were but to become who they already are in Christ.

<span id="page-80-10"></span>Second (4:23), the Ephesian Christians were taught "to be renewed in the spirit of your minds." Interestingly, the verb "to be renewed" is in the passive voice, suggesting God as the implied agent of the renewing. And yet, these believers were given the command to be renewed. Although believers are commanded to pursue this state of renewal, it is ultimately God who does the renewing. Specifically, this renewing is to take place "in the spirit of your minds." Elsewhere, Paul mentions that it is the Holy Spirit who is responsible for our inner renewal (Titus 3:5) and continual transformation (2 Cor. 3:18). Believers must yield themselves to God so that he will renew their inner person (Rom. 12:2).

<span id="page-80-13"></span><span id="page-80-11"></span><span id="page-80-8"></span><span id="page-80-5"></span><span id="page-80-3"></span><span id="page-80-2"></span><span id="page-80-0"></span>Third (Eph. 4:24), the Ephesian believers were taught "to put on the new self." It is never enough simply to put off or flee from sin; believers must also pursue that which is pure. The verb "put on" (*endyō*), like the verb "put off" (v. 22), was normally used for one's literal clothing, but it is used here figuratively for the putting on of specific characteristics and virtues (cf. Rom. 13:12, 14; Gal. 3:27; Eph. 6:11, 14; Col. 3:10, 12; 1 Thess. 5:8). "New self" is parallel to the "old self" (Eph. 4:22) and is a metaphor for the renewed or regenerate person. It refers to the believer's new nature, which includes a different mind-set and lifestyle. Whereas in 2:15 the

"new man" (same words in Gk.) referred to the corporate body of believing Jews and Gentiles, here it refers to the individual.

<span id="page-81-9"></span><span id="page-81-2"></span>Paul describes this "new self" in two ways. First, the new self is "created after the likeness of God": God both does the creating (cf. 2:10) and creates according to his own image. He is both the author of life and the pattern after which he himself creates (cf. Col. 3:10). Second, the new self is created "in true righteousness and holiness." This expression "explains what it means to be like God."30 Paul, therefore, instructs his readers to live in accordance with the new self, which was created by God to display the type of righteousness and holiness that belongs to him.

### *Response*

### LEAVING BEHIND THE NON-CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE

<span id="page-81-3"></span>Paul's instruction and exhortation in this section center on a two-fold response: leaving behind our former non-Christian lifestyle and living out the new identity we possess in Christ. Paul emphasizes that the lifestyle of the Gentiles is caused by corrupt and depraved thinking. They live according to the "futility of their minds" (v. 17b), are "darkened in their understanding" (v. 18a), are ignorant (v. 18b), have hard hearts (v. 18c), and are "callous" (v. 19a). Such degenerate thinking naturally leads to an immoral lifestyle. Consequently, they are given to sensuality, greed, and impurity (v. 19b). The way we think affects the way we live.

#### <span id="page-81-5"></span><span id="page-81-4"></span>LIVING OUT OUR NEW IDENTITY

<span id="page-81-7"></span>Paul's admonition involves seeking a renewed mind (v. 23). To live according to God's will and Word, believers must think correctly about who God is and who we are. The Ephesian believers had learned, had heard, and were taught the gospel of Christ. They were instructed that, because of their relationship and union with Christ, they were no longer dead in their trespasses and sins but were alive to God (2:1–5). Paul encourages them to be continually renewed in their minds so that they do not forget these important realities.

<span id="page-81-8"></span><span id="page-81-6"></span><span id="page-81-1"></span><span id="page-81-0"></span>But affirming the reality of being a new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17) does not mean we can neglect the need to fight to become what we already are. We are given a new nature that is created according to God's own nature of righteousness and holiness (Eph. 4:24). In one sense, we already have taken off the old self and put on the new (Col. 3:10). And yet, Paul can urge his readers to do this very thing. This is not a contradiction; it reflects the biblical tension of what theologians refer to as the "already" and the "not yet." This is the dual truth that (1) because of our union with Christ, we are a new creation/self (the "already"); (2) at the same time, because we are not perfected (the "not yet"), we must continually seek to be renewed by forsaking the old self and embracing the new. Therefore, our renewed thinking must always lead to godly living. We must "put off" the old self and "put on" the new (Eph. 4:22, 24). We must simultaneously forsake sin and seek holiness.

### <span id="page-82-7"></span>EPHESIANS 4:25–5:2

**<sup>25</sup>**Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. **26**Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, **<sup>27</sup>** and give no opportunity to the devil. **28**Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. **29**Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. **30**And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. **31**Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. **32**Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.

### *Section Overview*

This section begins with "Therefore" and is logically connected to what precedes, particularly the concepts of putting off the old self and putting on the new. There is, however, a significant shift in Paul's style of writing as he now employs short sentences with numerous imperatives. In these ten verses Paul uses thirteen imperatives, whereas up to this point he has used only one (Eph. 2:11). These exhortations address personal relationships within the body of Christ as Paul seeks to promote unity among God's people.

<span id="page-82-5"></span><span id="page-82-4"></span><span id="page-82-3"></span><span id="page-82-1"></span><span id="page-82-0"></span>In 4:25–32, Paul provides a series of negative commands (prohibitions), and in most cases the statement of what not to do is immediately followed by a statement of what *to* do. The Ephesian believers are to put away lying (4:25a), stealing (4:28a), corrupt talk (4:29a), and ungodly behavior (4:31). They are not to sin when angry (4:26a) nor grieve the Holy Spirit (4:30). On the contrary, they are to speak the truth (4:25b), work hard (4:28b), speak what is good for edification (4:29b), and be kind to others (4:32). The exhortation to walk in love (5:2) provides a general summary of the specific admonitions that precede.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-83-6"></span><span id="page-83-3"></span><span id="page-83-2"></span>4:25 "Therefore" marks a transition as Paul now offers a series of moral exhortations describing the type of behavior that results from the "new self," which is created according to the likeness of God (v. 24). The verb "having put away" (*apotithēmi* ) most likely functions in this verse as a command ("[you must] put away"; cf. Col. 3:9). Specifically, believers are to put away "falsehood," which, in the context, should probably be understood as speaking lies. Instead of lying, "let each one of you speak the truth." This statement is closely parallel to Zechariah 8:16 ("Speak the truth to one another"). By including "each," Paul emphasizes the individual responsibility of each believer to speak the truth. Further, each believer is to speak the truth "with his neighbor." Although Jesus expanded the concept of "neighbor" to include anyone in need, both the immediate context and the context of Zechariah 8 favor the interpretation that Paul is using the term to refer to members of the Christian community. This analysis is confirmed by the reason Paul offers as to why we are to speak the truth to our neighbor: "for we are members one of another." "Member" in this context refers to those who are part of the community of believers. It is not enough merely to put away lying; believers must also speak the truth.

<span id="page-83-4"></span>4:26–27 These two verses contain four commands: (1) be angry; (2) do not sin; (3) do not let the sun go down on your anger; and (4) do not give opportunity. The first command, "be angry," has caused considerable debate, because some have difficulty accepting the idea that Paul is commanding Christians to be angry when just a few verses later he will declare, "Let all . . . anger . . . be put away from you" (v. 31). Consequently, some translate this verse as a conditional statement: "If you are angry, do not sin." Although such an interpretation is possible, it is better to treat the phrase as a normal command that Christians are exhorted to keep.31

<span id="page-83-7"></span><span id="page-83-5"></span><span id="page-83-1"></span><span id="page-83-0"></span>"Be angry and do not sin" is an exact quote of Psalm 4:4 (LXX 4:5). Paul does not mean that Christians should be characterized by anger, but that they should appropriately express anger on certain occasions. That all anger is not sinful is demonstrated by the life of Jesus, who at times was angry (Mark 3:5) and yet was without sin (Heb. 4:15). John Stott correctly observes, "There is a great need in the contemporary world for more Christian anger. . . . In the face of blatant evil we should be indignant not tolerant, angry not apathetic. If God hates sin, his people should hate it too. If evil arouses his anger, it should arouse ours also."32

<span id="page-84-15"></span>And yet, the second command ("do not sin") also reminds us that it is easy to go from "righteous anger" to anger that is sinful (James 1:19–20). When believers express anger out of envy, pride, or any other sinful motive, they are engaging in ungodly behavior.

<span id="page-84-11"></span><span id="page-84-10"></span>The following two commands (of Eph. 4:26–27) further expand the dangers of unchecked anger. The command not to "let the sun go down on your anger" (v. 26) encourages us to deal with sin immediately so that it does not fester. The fourth command of verses 26–27 ("give no opportunity to the devil"; v. 27) provides further explanation for why it is foolish or unwise to let one's anger fester. Interestingly, Paul does not say the Devil produces anger but that, when our anger remains unchecked, such anger gives the Devil an opportunity to exploit the sin within us.

<span id="page-84-12"></span><span id="page-84-9"></span>4:28 The third command that illustrates the behavior of the "new self" (4:25–32) is that those who steal must instead work hard and help others in need. Stealing is forbidden in both the OT and the NT.33 Paul is addressing the poor, who, especially during difficult times, might be tempted to steal secretly from their employers. Paul's command, "Let the thief no longer steal," implies that some were stealing and needed to stop such behavior. Instead, Paul urges his readers to "labor, doing honest work with [their] own hands." The word translated "labor" (*kopiaō*) carries the nuance of physical exertion. Paul says that Christians should work hard with their own hands (cf. 1 Cor. 4:12; 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:8). He then offers the motivation: "that he may have something to share with anyone in need." The helping of others was expected of Christians (Acts 20:35; 1 Tim. 5:8; Titus 3:14; James 1:27; 1 John 3:17), and here Paul encourages those who were thieves to go beyond simply no longer stealing and to become generous to others.

<span id="page-84-16"></span><span id="page-84-13"></span><span id="page-84-8"></span><span id="page-84-6"></span><span id="page-84-5"></span>4:29 Paul again addresses the importance of speech (cf. Eph. 4:25). This time, however, instead of urging truth (instead of falsehood), he exhorts his readers to speak that which is good (instead of harmful talk). Not only are believers to achieve what is good with their hands (v. 28), they are also to do good with their mouths. Paul writes, "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths." The term translated "corrupt" (*sapros*) can refer to that which is "spoiled," "rotten," or "putrid." In the Gospels it is used of "diseased" trees (Matt. 7:17–18), "bad" fruit (Matt. 7:17–18), and "bad," or rotten, fish (Matt. 13:48). In this context, however, the term is used figuratively to refer to that which is harmful and tears down instead of building up (cf. Eph. 5:4; Col. 3:8).

<span id="page-84-14"></span><span id="page-84-7"></span><span id="page-84-3"></span><span id="page-84-2"></span><span id="page-84-1"></span>Jesus himself warned that everyone must give an account on the last day for every careless word spoken (Matt. 12:36). Here, Christians are to speak "only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion." The building up of others is a central concern of Paul in this chapter (Eph. 4:12, 16). Believers should use their conversation productively, to edify others and so build up the body of Christ. The purpose of such wholesome and beneficial speech is "that it may give grace to those who

<span id="page-84-4"></span><span id="page-84-0"></span><sup>33</sup> See Exodus 20:15; 22:1; Leviticus 19:11; Deuteronomy 5:19; Jeremiah 7:9; Hosea 4:2; Matthew 19:18; Mark 10:19; Luke 18:20; Romans 13:9; cf. 1 Corinthians 6:10; 1 Peter 4:15.

hear." When Christians build each other up through their words, it displays the grace of God. Others receive a blessing from God and are encouraged by carefully chosen, well-spoken words amid difficult situations.

<span id="page-85-4"></span>4:30 "And" links this command with the preceding one: "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths . . . *and* do not grieve the Holy Spirit." In this case, the Holy Spirit is especially grieved when followers of Christ speak unkindly to each other, though the other sins mentioned in the context would also apply. This demonstrates solidarity between God's people and God's Spirit, as the Spirit is grieved when believers engage in sinful behavior (especially in the use of destructive words against one another).

The verb translated "grieve" (*lypeō*) means "to cause severe mental or emotional distress."34 Because the Holy Spirit can be grieved, and since only persons can be grieved in this way, Paul undoubtedly understands the Spirit in fully personal terms. Although elsewhere in this ethical section Paul calls him merely "the Spirit," here he uses the fuller title ("the Holy Spirit") to emphasize that anything unholy is contrary to the Spirit's very nature. Paul further indicates that the Spirit is the instrument by which Christians are sealed (cf. 1:13). Believers have been sealed "for the day of redemption," which refers to the final day of salvation (or judgment), most likely the same event referred to by Paul's phrases "the day of the Lord" (1 Cor. 1:8; 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; 1 Thess. 5:2; 2 Thess. 2:2; cf. 2 Pet. 3:10) and "the day of [Jesus] Christ" (Phil. 1:6, 10; 2:16).

<span id="page-85-7"></span><span id="page-85-5"></span><span id="page-85-3"></span><span id="page-85-2"></span><span id="page-85-1"></span>4:31–32 Paul continues his ethical teaching by again exhorting his readers to put aside anger (cf. v. 26). The five-fold reference to various sins (bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander), the use of the word "all" (signifying every form of the sins mentioned), and the additional prepositional phrase "with all malice" all emphasize the comprehensive manner in which these sins are to be avoided. "Bitterness" refers to a callous heart that harbors past resentment. The terms translated "wrath" (*thymos*) and "anger" (*orgē*) are often used as virtual synonyms. If any distinction is intended between them, "wrath" would represent passionate outbursts whereas "anger" would refer to seething animosity. "Clamor" is used of "people shouting back and forth in a quarrel," while "slander" denotes "any kind of speech that is defamatory or abusive."35 Although it is difficult to be certain, there may be an intentional progression of sins from an inner disposition of bitterness to an outward display of harmful speech. Believers must also avoid "all malice," which signifies "a mean-spirited or vicious attitude or disposition."36 All of these sins must be "put away" (*airō*); they are contrary to the work of regeneration brought about by the Spirit of God.

<span id="page-85-6"></span>In contrast, Paul's readers are urged to "be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another" (v. 32; cf. Col. 3:12–13). Kindness is an attribute God possesses and displays to his creation, especially his covenant people (Pss. 25:7;

<span id="page-85-0"></span><sup>34</sup> BDAG, λυπέω (1).

<sup>35</sup> BDAG, s.v. κραυγή, βλασφημία.

<sup>36</sup> BDAG, s.v. κακίᾳ.

<span id="page-86-18"></span><span id="page-86-0"></span>31:19; 65:11), and one Paul desires believers to imitate. Tenderheartedness, which literally means to have healthy intestines, figuratively refers to internal feelings of compassion for another (1 Pet. 3:8). Feelings of bitterness, anger, and malice must be replaced with tenderhearted compassion. The last exhortation, to be forgiving, comes with a compelling comment: "as God in Christ forgave you" (cf. Col. 3:13). Because believers have freely received grace from God through the sacrificial work of Christ, they are called likewise to show grace and forgive others who have wronged them.

<span id="page-86-17"></span><span id="page-86-15"></span><span id="page-86-13"></span><span id="page-86-12"></span><span id="page-86-10"></span><span id="page-86-4"></span>5:1–2 Although a chapter break occurs here, the contents of 5:1–2 are closely related to what precedes, signaled by "therefore" (v. 1). Paul is summarizing the preceding exhortations (4:25–32), especially verse 32. Forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave us entails becoming imitators of God. Although Paul urges churches to imitate other churches (1 Thess. 2:14), himself (1 Cor. 4:16; 11:1; Phil. 3:17; 1 Thess. 1:6; 2 Thess. 3:7, 9), and Christ (1 Thess. 1:6), this is the only place where he urges believers to "be imitators of God" (but cf. Matt. 5:44–45; Luke 6:35–36). The designation "beloved children" provides the basis on which believers are to imitate God. It alludes to the Ephesian believers' own adoption (Eph. 1:5) and the love they have experienced from God (2:4; 3:17, 19).

<span id="page-86-14"></span><span id="page-86-8"></span><span id="page-86-7"></span><span id="page-86-2"></span><span id="page-86-1"></span>The second command is to "walk in love" (5:2). This admonition is likely an expansion of the previous one, with the previous command being a general exhortation and this more specific command providing an example of what it means to imitate God. In other words, those who imitate God are those who walk in love (cf. 4:1, 17; 5:8, 15). Christians are to be characterized as those who display a genuine love for one another.

<span id="page-86-11"></span><span id="page-86-9"></span><span id="page-86-3"></span>Paul again illustrates his exhortation with the example of Christ (cf. 4:32). "As Christ loved us" not only offers a comparison but also provides the motivation for believers' love. We are to love *as* Christ loves and also *because* Christ loves. Christ's love was eminently displayed when he "gave himself up for us." Although Scripture often portrays the Father as giving his Son, it is also true that Jesus freely surrendered his own life (John 10:11–18; 15:13). Specifically, he gave himself "for us," which means he gave himself *for* (the benefit of) his people; he also gave himself *in their place* (Eph. 5:25; 2 Cor. 5:14, 21; Gal. 1:4; 3:13; 1 Tim. 2:6; Titus 2:14). "Offering and sacrifice" is probably a way of referring to all types of sacrifices, which were thus fulfilled in Christ's giving of himself. The idea of a "fragrant" (lit., "for a fragrant aroma") offering is used figuratively here for "God's acceptance of a sacrifice because of the sincerity and wholeheartedness of the worshiper" (cf. Phil. 4:18).37

### <span id="page-86-16"></span><span id="page-86-5"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-86-6"></span>This section is highly practical, as it contains thirteen imperatives (commands and prohibitions). After building the doctrinal foundation in chapters 1–3, Paul now seeks to apply the truth of the gospel to everyday life by explaining what it means <span id="page-87-4"></span><span id="page-87-2"></span><span id="page-87-1"></span><span id="page-87-0"></span>to "walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called" (4:1) and to put off the old self and put on the new (4:22–24). But this section does not consist merely of exhortations. Woven throughout these verses are truths that both motivate and enable right living. Paul reminds us that we are (1) united to each other (4:25), (2) sealed with the Holy Spirit (4:30), (3) forgiven (4:32), (4) beloved children (5:1), and (5) loved by Christ, who became a sacrifice for us (5:2). Again, this passage highlights the triune nature of God. The Father ("God") is the one who forgives us (4:32) and adopts us as his beloved children (5:1). The Son ("Christ") is the one who loves us (5:2), and it is because we are in him that the Father forgives us (4:32). The Spirit is the one who seals us and who, because he dwells in us, can be grieved by us (4:30).

<span id="page-87-5"></span>Of all the commands in these verses, the command to love stands supreme. Imitating God is further described as walking in love (5:1–2). Paul defines love by the example of Christ, who offered himself as a sacrifice to God on behalf of sinners. Love is the most important of all the virtues because when it is consistently displayed, all of the other virtues will naturally be embraced. When Christians love each other, they will be careful to speak kindly to each other. When Christians love one another, they will not be bitter, angry, wrathful, or malicious toward one another but instead will be willing to work hard so that they can share with those in need (4:26, 28, 31).

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-88-9"></span><span id="page-88-4"></span>Paul continues his exhortations, forbidding immorality, greed, and filthy language and encouraging believers to live in the light. Whereas the exhortations in the previous section (4:25–5:2) emphasized the stark differences between walking according to the old self and walking according to the new, this section (5:3–14) portrays the contrast in terms of the lifestyles of sinful outsiders and of believers. In particular, this difference is highlighted by the contrasting themes of darkness and light.

<span id="page-88-8"></span><span id="page-88-6"></span>This section can be divided into two parts. In the first (vv. 3–6), Paul warns against various sins, especially those related to sexual immorality and greed, which should not even be named among believers (v. 3). Paul uses three vice lists, with each list containing three sins that his readers are to avoid. He also provides two motivations for shunning such behavior (vv. 3, 5). Paul then commands his readers not to be deceived with empty words (v. 6).

<span id="page-88-13"></span><span id="page-88-12"></span><span id="page-88-11"></span><span id="page-88-10"></span><span id="page-88-3"></span>In the second part of this passage (vv. 7–14), Paul presents a sustained contrast between light and darkness ("darkness" occurs twice [vv. 8, 11] and "light" five times [vv. 8, 9, 13, 14]). In verse 7, Paul warns believers not to become partners with those who deceive others. Again (cf. 4:1, 17; 5:2), the command "walk" is found, this time as Paul encourages his readers to walk as children of light. Instead of partaking in works of darkness, believers are to expose them (5:11). There is also a citation formula in verse 14, which either introduces an early Christian hymn or perhaps is a reflection on Isaiah 60:1.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-88-7"></span><span id="page-88-5"></span>5:3–4 This new section begins with "But" (v. 3), which contrasts with the positive command to imitate God and walk in love (5:1–2). The first triad of sins to avoid begins with "sexual immorality" ( *porneia*), which includes sexual activity of any kind outside a committed marriage relationship. "Impurity" can refer generally to uncleanness but is often coupled with "sexual immorality" in Paul's writings (2 Cor. 12:21; Gal. 5:19; Col. 3:5; 1 Thess. 4:3, 7). Consequently, it can carry the idea of sexual impurity. "Covetousness" refers to greed (and perhaps sexual greed).

<span id="page-88-16"></span><span id="page-88-2"></span><span id="page-88-1"></span>Paul's exhortation is that these sins "must not even be named among you." Paul is not violating his own advice by mentioning (i.e., "naming") such vices. Instead, he is declaring that such sins ought to be absent from the body of Christ. The motivation for avoidance of these sins is that such behavior is not "proper among saints." Believers are called to be holy and blameless before God (Eph. 1:4). Their behavior must be consistent with their new identity as God's chosen people who have been given a holy calling (4:1; 1 Thess. 4:3–7).

<span id="page-89-4"></span>Paul continues (Eph. 5:4) to urge his readers to avoid certain vices, with this triad emphasizing sins of speech that carry sexual connotations. "Filthiness" refers to that which is "in defiance of social and moral standards, with resulting disgrace, embarrassment, and shame."38 "Foolish talk" may "carry connotations of the kind of nonsensical talk that emerges from people in attendance at banquets where drunkenness and sexual immorality were common."39 "Crude joking" probably refers to a "quick-witted, clever humor employed in malicious or sexually vulgar ways."40 Such behavior is "out of place" (v. 4) among believers. In contrast, Christians should be characterized as those who offer "thanksgiving," since God is the source of "every good gift and every perfect gift" (James 1:17).

<span id="page-89-9"></span><span id="page-89-5"></span><span id="page-89-3"></span>5:5 Paul next issues two severe warnings intended to motivate his readers. The first is based on something they already knew, probably from Paul's teaching: anyone who fails to avoid the aforementioned sins "has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God." The three groups mentioned (the "sexually immoral," the "impure," and the "covetous") correspond to the three categories of sins mentioned in verse 3 ("sexual immorality," "impurity," and "covetousness"). Paul is not declaring that anyone who commits these sins is excluded from God's heavenly kingdom. Nevertheless, those who persistently give themselves over to such sins, even if they call themselves Christians, demonstrate that they are indeed excluded from eternal life. Paul parenthetically adds that a person who is greedy or covetous is also "an idolater" (cf. Col. 3:5). Brian Rosner defines the greedy as "those with a strong desire to acquire for themselves more and more money and possessions, because they love, trust, and obey wealth rather than God."41

<span id="page-89-8"></span><span id="page-89-7"></span><span id="page-89-1"></span><span id="page-89-0"></span>Although Paul mentions only three types of people here as being excluded from eternal life, in 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 he mentions "the unrighteous" (a general category), "adulterers," "men who practice homosexuality," "thieves," "drunkards," "revilers," and "swindlers" (cf. Gal. 5:19–21) as also being excluded. The reference to *Christ's* kingdom is not common in the NT (cf. 2 Tim. 4:1, 18; 2 Pet. 1:11), and the unique expression ("kingdom of Christ and God") emphasizes the reign of Christ, who is even now ruling with his Father over his creation (cf. Eph. 1:20–23).

<span id="page-89-10"></span><span id="page-89-6"></span><span id="page-89-2"></span>5:6 Paul offers a second warning as to why his readers should avoid sexual immorality and greed: God's wrath is coming. He begins by urging his readers to "let no one deceive you with empty words." The identity of those who were attempting to deceive is not mentioned; they could be either unbelieving Gentiles or, more likely, members of the Christian community who refused to take sin seriously. By propagating harmful beliefs, these false teachers were attempting to turn some from the truth to follow ungodly passions. But Paul solemnly warns that those

<span id="page-90-3"></span>whose lives are characterized by such sinful practices will experience God's stern judgment ("the wrath of God"). Believers will not face God's wrath, because they have been sealed with the Spirit and have a sure inheritance (1:13–14). Rather, God's wrath is reserved for the "the sons of disobedience," which refers to those who are unredeemed though perhaps a part of the covenant community (cf. 2:2).

<span id="page-90-11"></span><span id="page-90-5"></span><span id="page-90-1"></span>5:7–9 Paul's focus now shifts from urging his readers to avoid certain sins to the positive reason why believers must not associate with the ungodly lifestyle of non-Christians. Because the wrath of God is coming to those who are disobedient, believers should not participate in their behavior. When Paul says that believers must not be "partners" with the ungodly, he is not speaking of radical separation, with no contact (cf. 1 Cor. 5:9–10). The idea is that believers must not embrace any false teaching or immoral lifestyle associated with such teaching. In Ephesians 3:6 Paul used this term (there translated "partakers") positively to remind his readers that they are co-participants with Jewish believers as part of a new community in Christ. Ephesians 5:7 ("Therefore do not become partners with them") provides a stark contrast with verse 1 ("Therefore be[come] imitators of God").

<span id="page-90-12"></span><span id="page-90-10"></span><span id="page-90-9"></span><span id="page-90-8"></span><span id="page-90-6"></span><span id="page-90-0"></span>Verse 8 offers the rationale for why believers should not be fellow participants with false teachers and their lifestyle: such participation would be inconsistent with the believers' new identity in Christ. The "at one time . . . but now" schema contrasts a former time with the present. "Darkness" is used metaphorically to communicate a state of moral or spiritual darkness (cf. 4:18), whereas "light" communicates the illumination one receives to live a godly life as a consequence of a relationship with God. The imagery of darkness and light is used by Paul elsewhere (Rom. 13:12–13; 2 Cor. 4:4, 6; 6:14; Col. 1:12–13; 1 Thess. 5:5; 1 Tim. 6:16). Interestingly, Paul does not say that they were once *in* darkness and are now *in* light but rather that they *were* darkness and now *are* light. They were not merely in a dark environment but were themselves by nature dark (cf. Eph. 2:1, 12). "In the Lord" indicates that the believer's union with Christ makes the decisive difference in the new state.

<span id="page-90-7"></span><span id="page-90-4"></span><span id="page-90-2"></span>The final phrase in verse 8 ("walk as children of light") again highlights a main theme in Ephesians (4:1, 17; 5:2, 15). Paul shifts from stating a fact ("you are light") to giving a command ("walk as children of light"). That is, believers are exhorted to become what they already are. Although this might seem contradictory, it corresponds to the Bible's "inaugurated eschatology" (in Christ, believers *already* possess every benefit from his work, though they have *not yet* fully received all of those benefits). Their lifestyle must conform to the reality of being a new person in Christ. This sequence must be maintained, as the power needed for a transformed life can come only through a relationship with the God who can raise sinners from the dead.

As is rightly indicated by the ESV, verse 9 is parenthetical. The conjunction "for" is explanatory, connecting this clause to the previous verse by elaborating on what it means to walk in the light. "Fruit of light" is unique here in the NT but conveys the idea that fruit is produced by the light. That is, once a person receives new

<span id="page-91-8"></span><span id="page-91-0"></span>life in Christ, God's power works in that person to produce characteristics found in God himself. As "fruit," these virtues are by-products of faith in Christ and are not prerequisites for being accepted by God. "Good" or "goodness" is also listed as one of the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22) and is a quality found in God himself (Ps. 73:1). Here, "righteousness" refers to moral uprightness or living rightly before God and men (cf. Eph. 4:24; Phil. 1:11). "Truth," like the other two virtues, is also an attribute of God (cf. Eph. 4:24) and should characterize both the speech and lifestyle of believers.

<span id="page-91-12"></span><span id="page-91-9"></span><span id="page-91-7"></span><span id="page-91-4"></span><span id="page-91-3"></span>5:10 In verse 8 Paul instructed his readers to "walk as children of light," and now he offers a concrete example of how that is done. Believers must "try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord." The verb translated "discern" (*dokimazō*) means "put to the test," "examine," or "approve" (cf. Rom. 12:2). The word translated "pleasing" in Ephesians 5:10 is translated "acceptable" in Romans 12:2 (cf. Rom. 12:1; 14:18; 2 Cor. 5:9; Phil. 4:18; Col. 3:20). As those united to Christ by faith, it is the goal of believers to please their Lord and Master in all circumstances. To live according to that which is good, right, and true (Eph. 5:9) requires the practical wisdom of applying these ethical standards to particular circumstances.

<span id="page-91-13"></span><span id="page-91-11"></span>5:11 Walking as children of light also requires believers to "take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness" (cf. v. 7). In contrast to "the fruit of light" (v. 9) or "the fruit of the Spirit" (Gal. 5:22), which pleases the Lord and builds up his church, the works of those seeking to lead believers astray are labeled "unfruitful" because they come from "darkness" (cf. Rom. 13:12). Such deeds of darkness certainly include anything that displeases the Lord but here would specifically include sexual immorality, greed, and filthy or vulgar speech (Eph. 5:3–5).

<span id="page-91-10"></span><span id="page-91-5"></span>In contrast to this negative admonition, Paul offers a positive counterpart: "but instead expose them." That which believers are to expose most likely relates to the *deeds* of darkness rather than the persons themselves (cf. v. 13). Believers have the duty to expose the deeds of darkness by their conduct and words so that those who have gone astray will be convicted and will return to their senses.

<span id="page-91-15"></span><span id="page-91-14"></span><span id="page-91-6"></span><span id="page-91-2"></span><span id="page-91-1"></span>5:12 Paul now offers the reason ("For") why fruitless deeds of darkness are to be avoided and certain sins exposed: "It is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret." It is likely that the sins done secretly are the sexual vices mentioned in verse 3 (cf. Rom. 13:13). In view of the darkness/light metaphor, Paul introduces the related contrast of secret/visible (cf. Mark 4:22; Luke 12:2; John 18:20; Rom. 2:16; 1 Cor. 4:5; 14:25). Those who participate in such deeds of darkness are members of the Christian community who are engaging in immoral behavior. If *speaking* of certain sins is bad enough, how much more offensive to God is actually *engaging* in them? Since Paul twice encourages exposing or rebuking such sin (Eph. 5:11, 13), he obviously does not mean that such sin cannot be verbally addressed. Rather, Paul is emphasizing the utterly shameful or especially evil nature of some sins.

<span id="page-92-15"></span><span id="page-92-14"></span><span id="page-92-13"></span><span id="page-92-12"></span><span id="page-92-4"></span>5:13–14 In contrast ("But") to the secret deeds done in darkness (v. 12), "when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible" (v. 13). Although the term "anything" is used, in the context Paul is referring to those deeds done in secret. In verse 11 Paul instructed the mature believers to "expose" the "unfruitful works of darkness." Verse 13 explains the positive effects when such sins are exposed to the light (cf. John 3:20–21). The light not only exposes such sin but can also transform the sinner (2 Cor. 4:6). Some inevitably come out of the darkness and respond favorably to the light, and they themselves become light: "for anything that becomes visible is light" (Eph. 5:14). Those who accept the process of reproof and exposure become light in the Lord.

<span id="page-92-16"></span><span id="page-92-9"></span><span id="page-92-8"></span><span id="page-92-2"></span><span id="page-92-0"></span>Using the same introductory formula ("Therefore it says") as in 4:8, where he quoted Psalm 68:18, Paul now seems to quote an early Christian hymn (perhaps written by Paul himself) deeply influenced by several OT passages. The closest parallels to this citation include Isaiah 26:19 ("Your *dead* shall *live*; their bodies shall *rise*") and Isaiah 60:1–2 (which contains the darkness/light metaphor). The hymn consists of three lines: the first two lines are parallel, each containing an imperative, while the third line contains a promise.

<span id="page-92-11"></span><span id="page-92-7"></span><span id="page-92-6"></span><span id="page-92-3"></span>The first line ("Awake, O sleeper") is used figuratively of those who are slumbering in moral and spiritual indolence (Rom. 13:11–14; 1 Thess. 5:5–8). Although some view this line (as well as the next) as a reference to conversion, it is better to see it as an exhortation to disobedient or wayward believers. The second line ("and arise from the dead") is parallel to the first and thus has a similar meaning. That is, "the dead" is used metaphorically for those who sleep. Believers have died to sin and therefore must not let sin enslave them (Rom. 6:11–13). Throughout the entire context of Ephesians 5:3–14, Paul has been encouraging and warning believers to walk not in darkness but in light. The third line ("and Christ will shine on you") is a promise given to those who obey by putting away sin and following the example of Christ. The result is that the risen and ascended Lord will shine on them, which signifies "the empowering presence of the Lord that directs, encourages, sustains, and helps them in their journey of discipleship."42

### *Response*

#### THE NEED TO AVOID UNGODLY BEHAVIOR

<span id="page-92-5"></span>Paul emphatically teaches that, as believers, we have the responsibility to stay clear of sexual immorality, greed, and inappropriate language. Because these three categories of sin were common during the first century, Christians were often admonished to avoid them. For example, God's people were exhorted to flee sexual immorality (Acts 15:20; 1 Cor. 6:18; Col. 3:5; 1 Thess. 4:3; Heb. 12:16; 13:4), greed/ love of money (Col. 3:5; 1 Tim. 6:9–11; Heb. 13:5), and unwholesome speech (Col. 4:6; 1 Tim. 4:12; Titus 2:8; cf. Prov. 4:24). These activities are not "proper" (Eph. 5:3) but "are out of place" (v. 4) for the saints.

<span id="page-92-17"></span><span id="page-92-10"></span><span id="page-92-1"></span><sup>42</sup> Clinton E. Arnold, *Ephesians*, ZECNT (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2010), 336.

<span id="page-93-7"></span>Such behavior must be avoided because believers have a new identity in Christ. But this is not only the reason we *must* change; it is also the reason we *can* change. Apart from the life-giving work of the Spirit, we would have no power (and no sustaining desire) to overcome sin. Paul says that before the Ephesian Christians came to faith, they "were darkness," but now that they have come to faith in Christ, they "are light" (cf. 1 Thess. 5:5; 1 Pet. 2:9). Their very *identity* was darkness. And because they were darkness, they had insufficient desire and ability to overcome sin. But now in Christ they *are* light. They have been given a new nature, including new abilities and desires. Before a change in behavior is possible, a change in identity is needed.

#### THE NEED TO EXPOSE UNGODLY BEHAVIOR

<span id="page-93-6"></span><span id="page-93-4"></span><span id="page-93-3"></span><span id="page-93-1"></span><span id="page-93-0"></span>What should be done when believers do not walk in the light but instead revert to sexual immorality, greed, and inappropriate language? Paul encourages the Christian community to "expose" such deeds (Eph. 5:11, 13). It is common today for people to claim that Christians must never "judge" others for their sins, usually quoting the words of Jesus to "judge not" (Matt. 7:1; Luke 6:37). Yet we know that those instructions are not absolute or unqualified, for Jesus goes on to say that once we get the log out of our own eye, we will see clearly to take the speck out of our brother's eye (Matt. 7:5; Luke 6:42). Additionally, Paul instructs the Corinthians to expose or judge those engaging in lewd conduct (1 Cor. 5:12). In fact, he tells them, "Purge the evil person from among you" (1 Cor. 5:13). Such public exposure that sometimes involves removal from the congregation is to be done only after the proper process has taken place. This process is explained by Jesus in Matthew 18:15–16 (cf. 1 Tim. 5:19). Paul often encourages believers to rebuke or expose those who have committed a grievous sin or are living in sin (1 Tim. 5:20; 2 Tim. 4:2; Titus 1:9, 13; 2:15). One of the functions of light is to illuminate the darkness. This must be done, however, with wisdom and sensitivity (Gal. 6:1).

### <span id="page-93-8"></span><span id="page-93-5"></span><span id="page-93-2"></span>EPHESIANS 5:15–21

**<sup>15</sup>**Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, **16**making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. **17**Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. **18**And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, **<sup>19</sup>** addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, **20**giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, **<sup>21</sup>** submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-94-2"></span>This paragraph introduces the last occurrence in Ephesians of the verb "walk" (5:15; cf. 4:1, 17; 5:2, 8). In particular, Paul desires the Ephesians to walk "carefully," which means being (1) not unwise but wise; (2) not foolish but understanding the Lord's will; and (3) not drunk but filled with the Spirit.

<span id="page-94-4"></span>The conjunction "therefore," along with the change in contrast from darkness/ light to unwise/wise, signals a transition to a new section. This section can be divided into three parts (5:15–16, 17, 18–21), with each part containing a negative and a positive imperative or assertion. The first part (vv. 15–16) begins with the command "look carefully then how you walk" (v. 15), followed by a negative assertion ("not as unwise") and a positive one ("but as wise"). The second part (v. 17) is governed by two contrasting imperatives: "do not be foolish" but instead "understand what the will of the Lord is."

<span id="page-94-10"></span><span id="page-94-9"></span><span id="page-94-8"></span><span id="page-94-7"></span>The third and longest section of this paragraph (vv. 18–21) is likewise governed by two contrasting imperatives: "do not get drunk with wine" (v. 18a) but instead "be filled with the Spirit" (v. 18b). The second verb ("be filled") is then modified by five participles ("addressing" [v. 19a], "singing" [v. 19b], "making melody" [v. 19b], "giving thanks" [v. 20], and "submitting" [v. 21]) describing what it looks like when someone is filled with the Spirit. The last phrase, "submitting to one another," stands as the heading over all the household codes (5:22–6:9) and should not be tied only to 5:22–33. Thus this paragraph is part of a larger application section that spans from 5:15–6:9, describing how Christians are to submit to one another, that they might show themselves to be filled with the Spirit.

- A. Walk with Wisdom (5:15–16)
- B. Walk with Understanding (5:17)
- C. Walk with Spirit-Filled Lives (5:18–21)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-94-3"></span>5:15–16 "Then" not only introduces a new section but also connects this passage to the previous one (vv. 3–14). Paul again exhorts his readers to walk a certain way, this time beginning with the command to "look carefully." In particular, Paul's audience is to pay careful attention to the way in which they walk (i.e., live), which is then unpacked with three contrasts.

<span id="page-94-1"></span><span id="page-94-0"></span>First, Paul instructs the Ephesian believers to live "not as unwise but as wise" (v. 15b). The behavior of believers should be characterized by wisdom (1:17; cf. 1:8; 3:10; Col. 4:5). In this context, wisdom refers to the practical wisdom gained from insight into God's will and workings.

<span id="page-94-6"></span>One of the ways in which Christians walk wisely is by "making the best use of the time" (Eph. 5:16; cf. Col. 4:5). Walking with wisdom means taking full advantage of every opportunity that comes our way. It is not enough to sit back and merely try to avoid evil. Believers must positively seek to use the gifts and graces given to them in a way that helps to further God's kingdom, taking advantage of every occasion "because the days are evil." Paul's language here reflects his eschatological perspective that we are living in the last days. Scripture sees all reality as represented by two ages: the present age and the coming age. Although the present age is evil (Rom. 8:18; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 2:2; 6:13), one day the Messiah will return and subdue all his enemies and make all things right. Until then, believers are urged to walk with wisdom and make use of every opportunity.

<span id="page-95-9"></span><span id="page-95-8"></span><span id="page-95-2"></span>5:17 The second way in which believers are to walk carefully is to "not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is." The negative aspect of this verse, avoiding foolishness (similar to not being "unwise"; v. 15), echoes the OT wisdom literature, which is full of admonitions not to live like a fool but instead to seek wisdom (e.g., Prov. 10:23; 23:9; 24:7).

<span id="page-95-5"></span><span id="page-95-0"></span>Paul provides a strong contrast ("but") with the previous statement by encouraging his readers to understand God's will. In this context, it is best to take "the will of the Lord" as referring generally to God's moral purpose. Note several important observations.43 (1) Although God has made known his divine will (Eph. 1:9), believers are still exhorted to *understand* it. God expects his people to be diligent in discovering what he has already revealed and in applying it to their lives. (2) Although Paul's use of "understand" includes a cognitive dimension, it cannot be restricted to merely an intellectual understanding but includes applied knowledge as well. (3) Although Paul usually speaks of *God's* will, here he refers to the *Lord's* will (cf. Rom. 12:2), i.e., the will of Christ. Paul thus gives this appeal a Christological emphasis. Because believers have already "learned Christ" (Eph. 4:20) and are now "light in the Lord" (5:8), they must seek to determine what is "pleasing to the Lord" (5:10) by doing his will.

<span id="page-95-11"></span><span id="page-95-10"></span><span id="page-95-7"></span><span id="page-95-6"></span><span id="page-95-3"></span>5:18–21 The third way in which believers are to walk carefully is to "not get drunk with wine, . . . but be filled with the Spirit" (v. 18). Drunkenness was a problem in the ancient world. In some Greco-Roman religions, drunkenness was even part of the worship experience. The cult of Dionysus (or Bacchus), prominent in Ephesus, used the vine as its cultic symbol. Philo, a first-century Jewish philosopher, wrote an entire treatise concerning this topic entitled *On Drunkenness*. The problem with drunkenness is that it leads to "debauchery," or "behavior which shows lack of concern or thought for the consequences of an action"44 (cf. Titus 1:6; 1 Pet. 4:4). We do not know whether this was a particular issue facing the Ephesian Christians or whether it merely was prominent in the culture (and therefore always a temptation).45 The main reason Paul references drunkenness, however, is probably to set up a contrast with the positive

#### Eph esians 5:15–21 96

<span id="page-96-3"></span>command to be filled with the Spirit, as this second command receives further elaboration (Eph. 5:19–21).

But what exactly does it mean to be "filled with the Spirit"? There are two main interpretations: (1) the Holy Spirit is what believers are filled with (i.e., the content; "*with* the Spirit") or (2) the Holy Spirit is the one who fills believers (i.e., the means; "*by* the Spirit"). Although a choice between the two options is not easy, the latter is preferable due to the parallel previous statement, which communicates *means* ("drunk *by means of* wine"). While the Spirit is the means by which believers are filled, the content of their filling is the fullness of the triune God (3:19; 4:13).

<span id="page-96-1"></span><span id="page-96-0"></span>Verses 19–21 describe the result of being filled with the Spirit, using four participial phrases. First, believers who are Spirit-filled address "one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" (v. 19a; cf. Col. 3:16). When singing, believers not only sing to God; there is also a horizontal dimension in which believers encourage and strengthen the faith of one another. The three terms "psalms," "hymns," and "spiritual songs" are "intended to cover all the singing that went on in worship rather than to differentiate between them."46

<span id="page-96-2"></span>The second result of being Spirit-filled involves "singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart" (Eph. 5:19b). This phrase should be viewed as depicting the same action as the previous one, with a different emphasis. The first focuses on the horizontal or corporate dimension of music in worship ("addressing one another"), whereas this action emphasizes the vertical and individual dimension ("to the Lord"). Heartfelt singing ("with your heart") should be directed to the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of his people.

<span id="page-96-6"></span><span id="page-96-4"></span>Third, believers who are Spirit-filled give "thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (v. 20). The action of "giving thanks" is qualified by four modifiers. Christians are to give thanks "always," which signifies that thanksgiving should be done regularly or constantly (1 Thess. 5:18). Christians should also give thanks "for everything," which means for all things or circumstances (including trials and suffering). Christians are to give thanks "to God the Father" because he is the creator and sustainer of all things. Finally, Christians give thanks "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" because the name of Jesus expresses the authoritative basis of prayers to God.

<span id="page-96-5"></span>The fourth and final result of being Spirit-filled involves "submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Eph. 5:21). Although some interpret this verse as referring to mutual submission in all relationships, Paul's use here is probably more specific, referring to the various social relationships that follow: wives submitting to their husbands; children submitting to their parents; and slaves submitting to their masters. The verb "submit" (*hypotassō*) regularly describes submission to someone in authority. The motivation for such submission is "out of reverence for Christ." The word translated "reverence" ( *phobos*) is sometimes rendered "fear." Because this usage applies to believers, it refers here to reverent awe.

#### WALKING IN WISDOM

<span id="page-97-3"></span><span id="page-97-2"></span><span id="page-97-1"></span>The Christian life requires wisdom—but not just anyone's understanding of wisdom. We must live according to the wisdom of God. The Bible declares, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov. 9:10; cf. Ps. 111:10; Prov. 1:7; 15:33). Knowledge and awestruck reverence of the character and ways of the God of the universe are the very foundation of true wisdom. Without such knowledge, we are merely grasping and hoping to find wisdom (Jer. 9:23–24; 1 Cor. 1:19). But even for Christians, walking in wisdom is not always easy. Thus Paul exhorts us to "look carefully . . . how you walk" (Eph. 5:15). The siren call of the world often draws us away from our devotion to Christ and from the way of wisdom. Therefore, we must be constantly encouraged to walk on the straight and narrow path that leads to life. Christ himself is the very wisdom of God personified (1 Cor. 1:24), and heeding his words is the mark of a wise person (Matt. 7:24).

#### <span id="page-97-8"></span><span id="page-97-6"></span><span id="page-97-4"></span>WALKING IN THE SPIRIT

<span id="page-97-7"></span><span id="page-97-5"></span><span id="page-97-0"></span>The empowerment to walk in wisdom comes from the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. The ethical injunctions Paul provides in the second half of Ephesians are impossible to accomplish unless the Spirit fills believers. Christians are able to "put to death the deeds of the body" only "by the Spirit" (Rom. 8:13). The only way to avoid gratifying "the desires of the flesh" is to "walk by the Spirit" (Gal. 5:16). Because God's Spirit fills and indwells us (similar to his Spirit's filling of the OT tabernacle and temple), we are to walk in holiness. We are to be holy just as he is holy (Lev. 11:44; 1 Pet. 1:16). Living under the influence of the Spirit necessarily means not being under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Just as we cannot serve both God and mammon (= things), we cannot walk by the Spirit if we are intoxicated with wine. One way in which we can assess our success in walking a Spirit-filled life is whether we (1) sing to the Lord with heartfelt praise (while at the same time singing to others); (2) give thanks in all circumstances; and (3) submit willingly to others.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-98-9"></span><span id="page-98-4"></span>This section is the first of three that address various relationships (sometimes referred to as "household codes"): (1) wives and husbands (5:22–33); (2) children and parents (6:1–4); and (3) slaves and masters (6:5–9). Although the ESV rightly signals the start of a new paragraph, the connection to the preceding paragraph is clear in the original Greek, as the verb "submit" is not repeated in 5:22 but is understood from the previous verse (v. 21).

<span id="page-98-6"></span><span id="page-98-5"></span><span id="page-98-3"></span><span id="page-98-2"></span><span id="page-98-1"></span>This passage contains the longest sustained teaching in the NT concerning the relationship between wives and husbands, falling into three parts. The first part of the passage (vv. 22–24) urges wives to submit to their husbands. This exhortation is grounded in the husband's headship over his wife, which is then compared to Christ's headship over the church. The exhortation is then repeated, though the sequence is reversed, and reinforced with "in everything" (v. 24). The second part (vv. 25–32) is an admonition to husbands to love their wives, which is compared to Christ's sacrificial love for the church. The exhortation is then repeated (v. 28) and is grounded in a person's love for himself and, again, Christ's love for the church. Verses 31 and 32, a quotation and interpretation of Genesis 2:24, provide a further reason for husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies. The third part (v. 33) contains a summary exhortation to both husbands and wives.

### *Comment*

5:22–24 In each of the three sections of Paul's household code (5:22–33; 6:1–4; 6:5–9), he first addresses those who are under authority (wives, children, and slaves) before addressing those in positions of authority (husbands, parents, and masters). Wives are commanded to submit to their husbands. The words "your own" (*idios*) indicate that Paul is addressing "wives" and not "women" generally. <span id="page-99-5"></span>They also indicate that a wife is not expected to submit to everyone's husband, but specifically her own husband. The use of the middle voice of the verb (carried over from v. 21) emphasizes the voluntary nature of the submission. In other words, Paul says that a wife is to submit willingly to her husband but nowhere does he say that husbands are to demand submission from their wives, because they should not need to do so. Next, Paul offers a comparison ("as to the Lord"), which provides motivation for women's submission to their husbands. When a woman voluntarily submits to her husband, she is simultaneously submitting to the Lord.

<span id="page-99-10"></span><span id="page-99-3"></span><span id="page-99-2"></span><span id="page-99-1"></span>Paul then offers a reason why wives should submit to their husbands. He says, "For the husband is the head of the wife" (v. 23). A wife should submit to her husband *because* God has placed the husband in a role of authority over his wife. "Head" here clearly represents "authority over" and not "source" (cf. 1:22; 4:15). Notice that Paul does not base his argument on culture or societal norms. Instead, he bases it on the God-appointed leadership role given to the husband (1 Cor. 11:3–12; 1 Tim. 2:11–13). Submission does not imply an inherent inferiority. Christ is equal in status to the Father but willingly submits himself to his Father's will (1 Cor. 15:28). In the same way, women are equal in value and worth to men, since both are created in God's image. But, based on God's design, men and women assume different roles in the marriage relationship. Again Paul draws a comparison: "as Christ is the head of the church." Christ is the head of the church in a way analogous to the husband's being the head of his wife. Paul further clarifies that the church is Christ's "body," an image used earlier in Ephesians (1:23; 2:16; 4:4, 12, 16). Christ relates to the church as "its Savior," as he redeemed her for himself.

<span id="page-99-6"></span><span id="page-99-4"></span>Verse 24 restates the previous admonition by reversing the order: "Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands." Just as the church voluntarily submits to Christ, so also wives should freely and willingly submit to their husbands. The prepositional phrase "in everything" should not be taken absolutely, since a wife should not submit to her husband in matters that are sinful, harmful, or contrary to God's commands (Acts 5:29). And yet these words are not conditioned on the husband's love for his wife. Although there may be exceptions, the focus of the passage is on the importance of the wife's willing submission to the leadership of her husband (even if her husband is an unbeliever).

<span id="page-99-8"></span><span id="page-99-0"></span>5:25–27 After commanding wives to submit to their husbands, Paul turns his attention to the husbands by commanding them to love their wives. Based on other ancient texts, it is somewhat unexpected that Paul urges husbands to *love* their wives instead of urging them to *rule over* or *domineer* their wives. In extrabiblical Jewish literature, husbands were rarely exhorted to love their wives, and the verb "love" (*agapaō*) was never used in Greco-Roman household codes in relation to the duties of husbands. Here the command is to follow Christ in the way of love. The fact that this exhortation is repeated signifies its importance (5:28, 33; cf. Col. 3:19).

<span id="page-99-9"></span><span id="page-99-7"></span>The manner in which husbands should love their wives is compared to the way "Christ loved the church" (Eph. 5:25). Christ's love for his bride (the church) becomes the standard by which a husband should love his bride. Specifically, Christ's love is most clearly demonstrated in how he "gave himself up for her." His love was self-initiated and self-sacrificial. The parallel, however, should not be pressed. A husband should be like Christ with his self-sacrificing love, but he does not die in her place, nor does he sanctify or cleanse her. He should, however, be willing to sacrifice everything to protect and care for his wife.

<span id="page-100-8"></span><span id="page-100-0"></span>Verses 26 and 27 introduce three purpose clauses identifying the goal of Christ's self-sacrificial love for the church. First, Christ gave himself up for the church "that he might sanctify her" (v. 26). "Sanctify" (*hagiazō*) means to make holy or set apart, and the concept is derived from the OT practice of setting something or someone apart to God (Lev. 8:11–12; 11:44; 16:16–19). How is it that Christ sanctifies his bride? He "cleansed her by the washing of water with the word." That is, the church is sanctified and purified by the cleansing power of the gospel. Most commentators have taken the reference to "the washing of water" as referring to baptism, the most poignant Scriptural form of cleansing, in which Christ cleanses for himself a people (1 Cor. 6:11; Titus 3:5). The language here may further be drawn from the imagery of the bridal bath found in Ezekiel 16:8–14. Specifically, Paul writes that the church is cleansed by the "word" (*rhēma*), which most likely refers to the gospel (Eph. 6:17; Rom. 10:8, 17; Heb. 6:5; 1 Pet. 1:25).

<span id="page-100-9"></span><span id="page-100-4"></span><span id="page-100-3"></span><span id="page-100-2"></span><span id="page-100-1"></span>Second, Christ sanctifies the church "so that he might present the church to himself in splendor" (Eph. 5:27). The idea of presenting most likely alludes to the Jewish custom of presenting the bride, which here is applied to Christ's presentation of the church at his second coming (cf. 2 Cor. 11:2, where Paul presents the church as a pure virgin to Christ). At the end of time, when Christ presents the church in her splendor, she will be "without spot or wrinkle or any such thing" (Eph. 5:27). The lack of "spot" or "wrinkle" speaks of the outward perfection and beauty of a young bride who has no physical defect. These terms here, however, are used spiritually to represent the church's moral purity and excellence. The final purpose clause amplifies the previous negative statement and clarifies that Christ will present the church without any flaws so "that she might be holy and without blemish." Earlier Paul had reminded his readers that God chose them before the foundation of the world so that they might be "holy and blameless" (1:4).

<span id="page-100-11"></span><span id="page-100-10"></span><span id="page-100-7"></span><span id="page-100-5"></span>5:28–32 For a second time Paul exhorts husbands to love their wives. The introductory phrase "in the same way" (v. 28) links the statement to the previous verses (vv. 25b–27): just "as Christ loved the church . . . in the same way husbands should love their wives." The repetition of the verb "love" signifies its importance in this passage (vv. 25, 28 [3x], 33).

<span id="page-100-6"></span>Paul adds a second comparison, stating that husbands are to love their wives "as their own bodies." Some view this statement as unexpected (since the text transitions from Christ's love to self-love) or too demeaning (since it subjects the wife to her husband's selfishness). Paul, however, provides a practical and concrete example of love in the marriage relationship. Just as it is natural for a man to love, nurture,

and protect himself, in the same way he should love, nurture, and protect his wife. Further, the ultimate example of one loving his own body has just been demonstrated in Christ, who loved his own body (the church) to the point of death (v. 25).

<span id="page-101-4"></span><span id="page-101-3"></span>The final phrase in verse 28 ("He who loves his wife loves himself") introduces a parenthetical explanation of the preceding clause ("as their own bodies"). It demonstrates that Paul's point is not merely to discuss a man's love for his own body but to signify how natural it should be for a husband to love his wife. It is possible that Paul is applying the second great commandment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Lev. 19:18). Since the wife can be regarded as a husband's closest "neighbor," this text would apply especially to the marriage relationship. In addition, because the husband and wife become "one flesh" (Eph. 5:31), when the husband loves his wife, he is also loving himself.

<span id="page-101-7"></span><span id="page-101-5"></span><span id="page-101-1"></span>So as not to be misunderstood, Paul further clarifies his previous comments concerning a husband's self-love. He writes, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it" (v. 29). Although Paul sometimes uses the word "flesh" (*sarx*) with a negative connotation, here it simply refers to one's physical body. Additionally, the words "flesh" and "body" (*sōma*) are used interchangeably in this context (cf. 1 Cor. 6:16), and the use of "flesh" here anticipates the quotation of Genesis 2:24 in verse 31.

<span id="page-101-2"></span><span id="page-101-0"></span>Although there may be exceptions, it is *generally* true that people do not hate themselves. Rather, the average person naturally takes care of himself, which is evidenced by the fact that he "nourishes" (feeds) and "cherishes" (looks after) his own body. So, a husband ought to be attentive to the needs of his wife. Paul again uses the Christ-church relationship to make a comparison ("just as Christ does the church"). Just as Christ nourishes and cares for the church, so a husband naturally should nourish and care for his wife. Paul next offers a reason for why Christ lovingly nurtures and tenderly cares for his people: "because we are members of his body" (v. 30). In a similar manner, husbands should care for their wives as their own bodies. Thus, the union of believers with Christ is analogous to the one-flesh union of husband and wife.

<span id="page-101-6"></span>In verse 31 Paul quotes Genesis 2:24, which is "the most fundamental statement in the OT concerning God's plan for marriage."47 What makes this citation difficult to interpret is not the content but how it connects to what Paul has just said. If it is related to a husband's relationship with his wife, Paul is saying, "A husband should love his wife because they are one flesh, just as God intended from the beginning." However, the most immediate context (v. 30, "because we are members of his body") refers to Christ and the church, not the husband/wife relationship. The purpose of the citation centers on the last phrase of the quotation ("the two shall become *one flesh*"). Although the quotation is applicable to both the relationship between Christ and the church and the relationship between a husband and his wife, the former relationship is Paul's main focus; in verse 32 he explicitly states that he intends the quotation to refer to Christ and the church.

<span id="page-101-8"></span><sup>47</sup> O'Brien, *Ephesians*, 429.

<span id="page-102-2"></span><span id="page-102-0"></span>That Paul is not merely speaking of the husband/wife relationship becomes evident in verse 32: "This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church." Paul calls the Christ-church relationship a "mystery," which in Paul's usage refers to the plan of God once hidden but now revealed in Jesus (1:9; 3:3–4, 9; 6:19; Rom. 16:25). Second, Paul calls this mystery "profound" or great (*megas*), stressing the magnitude or significance of the mystery. Third, Paul specifically identifies the mystery as referring to "Christ and the church." Just as the first Adam was joined to his wife and they became one flesh, so also the last Adam is joined to his bride so that they become one with him. Note that Paul's argument cites Christ's relationship with the church as the template after which human marital relationships are patterned, not vice-versa. The mystery is not merely the Christ-church relationship but is more specifically the "interplay of human marriage and the divine marriage between Christ and his people. . . . A Christian marriage . . . reproduces in miniature the beauty shared between the Bridegroom and the Bride."48 God created human marriage so that his people would have a category for understanding the relationship between Christ and his church.

<span id="page-102-3"></span><span id="page-102-1"></span>5:33 Paul now returns to his original topic of the husband/wife relationship (signaled by "however") and offers a concluding summary. This time, however, he addresses the husbands first ("let each one of you love his wife as himself"), making his appeal emphatically personal ("each one"). Such a strong focus on the individual stresses that Paul expects every husband (and wife) to embrace these divine standards personally. In essence, Paul is declaring that no one is exempt from diligently fulfilling these commands. The charge for the husband to love his wife as himself is similar to Paul's earlier exhortations (vv. 25, 28). The charge to the wife, however, is slightly different. Whereas earlier wives were exhorted to *submit* to their husbands, here they are exhorted to *respect* them ("and let the wife see that she respects her husband"). The verb translated "respect" ( *phobeomai* ) is often translated "fear" in the NT. The idea in this context is not terror but reverential respect based on the husband's God-given position of authority. Also note that there are no conditions placed on these commands. The husband is to love his wife regardless of whether she willingly submits to his leadership. Similarly, the wife is to submit to and respect her husband whether or not he loves her as Christ loved the church.

### *Response*

### THE MARRIAGE OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH

Paul's instructions about marriage are highly Christological. Both the foundation and the goal of marriage are based on the relationship of Christ to his church. He loves her, sacrificed himself for her, sanctifies her, cleanses her, nourishes her, and cherishes her, and will present her blameless. Paul is not merely providing instructions based on the culture of his time (Greco-Roman or Jewish); his presentation is patterned after the relation of Christ to the church and the institution of marriage between the very first humans. Therefore, Paul's instructions are transcultural, applying to the modern context as much as the ancient one. God created marriage so that people would understand the relationship between Christ and his bride. God's primary intention for creating the institution of marriage was to illustrate his love for the church.

#### THE ROLE OF THE WIFE IN MARRIAGE

<span id="page-103-4"></span><span id="page-103-2"></span><span id="page-103-1"></span>The main exhortation given to wives is to submit to their husbands. Paul begins this passage with this charge (v. 22a), implicitly repeats it at the end of the instruction to wives (v. 24b), and concludes the passage with a similar command (v. 33b; cf. Col. 3:18; Titus 2:5; 1 Pet. 3:1, 5). Submission is a willing or voluntary act of yielding to the leadership of her husband, not the husband's demanding of obedience. It does not imply that women are inferior to men but simply recognizes their different God-ordained roles.

<span id="page-103-0"></span>This submission is nuanced in several ways. First, wives are to submit *to their own* husbands. Paul is not teaching that every woman must submit to every man, but teaching specifically that a wife must submit to her husband because of their marital relationship. Second, wives are to submit *as to the Lord*. Part of what this means is that submission is not limited to husbands who are worthy of respect. Lack of submission to one's husband is lack of submission to Christ. Third, wives are to submit *because* the husband is the head of the wife. God created the husband to be the head and the wife to serve as the helper (Gen. 2:18). Fourth, wives are to submit *as the church submits to Christ*. Fifth, wives are to submit in *everything*. Although this cannot be taken absolutely (and a wife should not submit if her husband encourages her to sin), the basic idea is that a wife should look for ways to please her husband. Finally, wives are to submit *respectfully*. A wife should display reverential respect to her husband because of his leadership role.

#### THE ROLE OF THE HUSBAND IN MARRIAGE

<span id="page-103-3"></span>The main exhortation given to husbands is to love their wives, which is repeated three times (vv. 25a, 28a, 33a). This loving relationship is nuanced in several ways. First, husbands are to love their wives *unconditionally*. Just as Christ loved the church when she was not worthy, so also a husband should love his wife whether or not she is deserving of his love. Second, husbands are to love their wives *sacrificially*. Just as Christ gave himself up for the church, so also husbands should be willing to serve their wives, sacrificing their own rights and interests. Third, husbands are to love their wives *purposefully*. Just as Christ sanctifies, cleanses, and presents his bride as pure, so also husbands should seek to lead their wives with the purpose of their conforming to the image of Christ. Finally, husbands are to love their wives *affectionately*. Just as Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, so also a husband should provide for his wife. He must also seek to communicate and understand his wife so that he may adequately know her needs.

### EPHESIANS 6:1–4

6 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. **<sup>2</sup>** "Honor your father and mother" (this is the first commandment with a promise), **<sup>3</sup>** "that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land." **<sup>4</sup>**Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-104-3"></span><span id="page-104-2"></span>This paragraph represents the second section of the household code, with instructions given to children and parents. The paragraph can be divided into two sections, with each section consisting of two commands. First, children are exhorted to "obey" and "honor" their parents (Eph. 6:1–2). These two commands are followed by reason ("for this is right"; v. 1b) and purpose ("that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land"; v. 3) clauses. Second, fathers are given a negative command followed by a positive command. They are exhorted not to "provoke" their children to anger but rather to "bring them up" in the training and teaching of the Lord (v. 4).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-104-4"></span><span id="page-104-1"></span>6:1–3 Turning to his second group, Paul first addresses children: "obey your parents in the Lord" (v. 1). The term translated "children" (*tekna*) does not necessarily indicate small children but could be used also of adult children, who often remained under their father's authority for most or all of his life. Here, however, Paul seems to be addressing children who are still in the process of being trained by their parents (v. 4) yet are old enough to understand their relationship to the Lord (v. 1). Children were not usually addressed in Greco-Roman household codes (their obedience was simply assumed), but Paul addresses children as responsible members of the congregation. This also suggests that Paul assumes whole families will be gathered in one place for worship.

<span id="page-104-0"></span>The verb "obey" is stronger than the command given to wives to "submit" (5:22), indicating absolute obedience (though certainly some exceptions must be allowed). <span id="page-105-5"></span>"In the Lord" modifies the verb "obey" and not the phrase "your parents" (cf. Col. 3:20); Paul is not saying that only Christian parents should be obeyed. The referent of "Lord" is Christ, not God the Father. "For this is right" provides the reason for the previous exhortation: honoring one's parents is "right" because it is widely accepted and acknowledged as fitting and proper.

<span id="page-105-0"></span>In order to support and bolster his injunction for children to obey their parents, Paul cites the fifth commandment: "Honor your father and your mother" (Eph. 6:2; cf. Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16). The concepts of obeying and honoring are very similar, since parents are dishonored when children do not obey them. But the command to honor could also include adult children who have moved out of the house but still need to show respect for their parents and perhaps care for them when they are older.

Paul interrupts his citation of the fifth commandment by adding the parenthetical comment "this is the first commandment with a promise" (Eph. 6:2), which most likely refers to the fifth commandment in the Decalogue, which contains an explicit promise. Although some claim that the first promise in the Decalogue is actually attached to the second commandment, the description attached there is not so much a promise as a description of God's character, which could apply to all the commandments. The fifth commandment is cited five times in the NT (Matt. 15:4; 19:19; Mark 7:10; 10:19; Luke 18:20), but only here is its promise included as well.

<span id="page-105-3"></span><span id="page-105-2"></span><span id="page-105-1"></span>In Ephesians 6:3 Paul resumes his quotation of the fifth commandment by citing its promise, which Paul expands into two reasons as to why children should obey their parents. The first reason is so "that it may go well with you," which relates to one's general prosperity. The second reason is so "that you may live long in the land." The omission of the additional phrase from Exodus 20:12 ("that the Lord your God is giving you") universalizes the reference to "the land" to mean "the earth" in general rather than merely the land of Canaan. Thus the promise has an ongoing application to Paul's readers. Of course, these promises of prosperity and long life must be taken not as absolutes but as general principles.

<span id="page-105-4"></span>6:4 Instead of addressing both parents, Paul directs his exhortations specifically to fathers. In Greco-Roman and Jewish cultures, fathers were typically responsible for the education and discipline of their children. Paul provides both a negative command (prohibition) and a positive one. First, Paul instructs the fathers, "Do not provoke your children to anger." To "provoke" has to do with causing someone to become angry. Andrew T. Lincoln explains that this prohibition forbids "excessively severe discipline, unreasonably harsh demands, abuse of authority, arbitrariness, unfairness, constant nagging and condemnation, subjecting a child to humiliation, and all forms of gross insensitivity to a child's needs and sensibilities."49 Like most of the imperatives in Ephesians, this verb conveys a general precept and does not indicate whether or not such provocation was in fact occurring in the Ephesian church.

<sup>49</sup> Lincoln, *Ephesians*, 406. Compare Colossians 3:21.

<span id="page-106-3"></span>Second, Paul commands the fathers to "bring [their children] up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." The verb "bring up" (*ektrephō*) was used in 5:29 to refer to the love the husband has for his own body as he "nourishes" (*ektrephō*) and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church. Here, the term is used more generally for caring for and rearing children to maturity. The first term, "discipline" (sometimes translated as "training"), although it can refer more specifically to chastisement, probably has the sense of comprehensive education or training. The second term, "instruction," refers to the training that takes place through verbal correction (i.e., exhortations, warnings, and rebukes). Finally, this training is "of the Lord." It is not merely moralistic discipline and instruction but that which comes from the Lord and focuses the child's faith and hope on Christ.

### *Response*

<span id="page-106-2"></span><span id="page-106-1"></span><span id="page-106-0"></span>These commands to children and parents, as well as those to wives and husbands (5:22–33) and slaves and masters (6:5–9), are all a practical application of what it means to walk with wisdom as a follower of Christ (5:15) and to be filled with the Spirit (5:18). It is also important to note the Christological focus of the exhortations. Children are to obey their parents "in the Lord" (6:1), which means they should obey as part of their commitment to Christ. Fathers are instructed to train their children in the ways of the Lord Jesus Christ (6:4).

<span id="page-106-6"></span><span id="page-106-5"></span><span id="page-106-4"></span>Paul does not merely urge children to obey and honor their parents; he also provides motivation for doing so. He give at least three reasons: (1) because it is proper ("for this is right"; 6:1b); (2) because God commanded it (quoting the fifth commandment; 6:2); and (3) because there is great reward ("that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land"; 6:3). Children are to obey their parents as long as they live with them and are to respect and honor them even after moving away.

<span id="page-106-7"></span>By singling out fathers, Paul implicitly underscores their leadership role in the family. Unfortunately, this responsibility is abandoned by many men today. Fathers should be actively engaged in educating and training their children in the ways of God and modeling what it means to be a follower of Christ.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-107-1"></span>This paragraph represents the third and final section of the household code, with instruction given to slaves and masters. As with the previous section, the passage nicely divides into two parts, with each part containing one command. First, slaves (ESV "bondservants"; Eph. 6:5, 6, 8) are exhorted to "obey" their masters (vv. 5–8), followed by a series of phrases describing the manner in which slaves are to obey. Second, masters are urged to "do the same" to their slaves (v. 9), knowing they will be held accountable for their actions. Paul makes a similar appeal to both groups based on what they should already know (vv. 8, 9).

	- A. Slaves, Obey Your Masters (6:5–8)
	- B. Masters, Properly Treat Your Slaves (6:9)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-107-0"></span>6:5–8 Turning to his third group, Paul first addresses bondservants or slaves by commanding, "Obey your earthly masters" (v. 5). Slaves were not normally addressed in household codes; instead, attention was given to how masters were to treat their slaves. Paul, however, treated all groups—including women, children, and slaves as ethically responsible and equal members in the body of Christ. Paul uses the same verb ("obey") used with children in relation to their parents (v. 1). It is not surprising that Paul would command slaves to obey their masters, but what is unique is the manner in which he exhorts them, along with the accompanying motivations.

<span id="page-108-2"></span>Paul specifies what kind of obedience he expects of slaves by adding six qualifying phrases to identify the manner in which they are to obey their masters. First, they are to obey "with fear and trembling" (cf. 1 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 7:15; Phil. 2:12). The object of this fear and trembling is not God (at least not directly) but their earthly masters. Second, slaves are to obey "with a sincere heart," signifying integrity and purity of motive. Third, slaves are to obey "as you would Christ." Slaves are to obey their masters as part of their obedience to Christ, their ultimate master.

<span id="page-108-4"></span>Fourth, slaves are to obey "not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers" (Eph. 6:6; cf. Col. 3:22). The idea here involves work that is done only when the owner is present or only to bring attention to oneself—outward service without inward dedication. Paul adds that such slaves are "people-pleasers" because their work is done to please their master, not God. Fifth, slaves are to obey "as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart" (Eph. 6:6). Here Paul contrasts how slaves are not to behave with a positive statement. Their true and ultimate identity is as bondservants of Christ. They serve someone with more authority and honor than any of their earthly masters. Thus they should obey God and follow his will "from the heart." This literally means "from the soul" and conveys the source of the motivation by which godly slaves are to serve their masters, contrasting with "eye-service." The idea is wholehearted obedience and is similar to "with a sincere heart" in verse 5.

<span id="page-108-5"></span><span id="page-108-3"></span>Sixth, slaves are to obey by serving with a good attitude ("rendering service with a good will"; v. 7). That is, slaves should have a positive attitude and serve with eagerness or wholeheartedness. Again, Paul urges them to consider their obedience "as to the Lord and not to man." Their service must be rendered with the ultimate aim of serving Christ, not merely the earthly master. Perhaps this mind-set would enable them to obey with a good attitude, especially when their masters were acting unjustly or not recognizing their hard work.

Following these six descriptions of proper obedience, Paul in verse 8 provides the motivation or reason for such behavior ("knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord"). That is, slaves should be obedient, with good attitudes, because they will be rewarded at the last judgment by their heavenly Master for the good they do. Regardless of whether or not their earthly masters see or acknowledge their good works, nothing will escape the gaze of their Master in heaven (Rom. 2:6; 2 Cor. 5:10; Col. 3:25; 1 Pet. 5:4). Paul then adds that such evaluation will occur whether the person in question "is a bondservant or is free," reminding his readers that all people, both slave and free, will be rewarded according to their deeds. Because there is no favoritism with God, no social status will receive special treatment (cf. Rom. 2:11).

<span id="page-108-6"></span><span id="page-108-1"></span><span id="page-108-0"></span>6:9 Finally, Paul addresses slave masters and exhorts them to "do the same" to their slaves. O'Brien says this exhortation would have been "shocking" and "outrageous" to a first-century slave owner.50 It is not clear what precisely Paul has in mind with

<sup>50</sup> O'Brien, *Ephesians*, 454.

this command. The referent seems to be not merely the manner in which slaves are to perform their duties, because the focus is on the *actions* ("*do* the same") of slave owners and not just their *attitudes*. There is a reciprocal, but not symmetrical, relationship between the two groups, since masters are never admonished to obey (v. 5) or serve (v. 7) their slaves.

<span id="page-109-3"></span>One of the ways masters are to treat their slaves properly is by no longer threatening them. Threatening slaves was common in the ancient world, including threats of being physically beaten, sexually harassed, or sold to another owner. But Paul teaches that "all forms of manipulating, demeaning, or terrifying slaves by threats" must be rejected by Christian masters.51

<span id="page-109-0"></span>Paul offers two reasons that should motivate masters to treat their slaves appropriately. First, both slaves and masters will be held accountable to the same Master in heaven ("he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven"). Christian masters are actually fellow slaves with their own servants of the same Lord. They will have to give an account on the last day for their deeds, including how they treated their slaves. Second, the Lord does not judge with partiality ("there is no partiality with him"; cf. Rom. 2:11; Col. 3:25; James 2:1). Social or economic status will not give anyone an advantage on the day of judgment. No special consideration will be given to those who have made a great name for themselves in this life. This knowledge should influence how Christian masters treat their slaves.

### *Response*

<span id="page-109-4"></span>Although this passage was given to affect the attitudes and actions of both slaves and masters, its Christological focus is undeniable. In every verse "Christ" (vv. 5, 6) or "Lord" (vv. 7, 8, 9) is referenced. As slaves of Christ (v. 6), the Ephesian slaves are to obey their masters as if they were obeying or serving Christ (vv. 5, 7), since they will be rewarded by Christ (v. 8). Masters should treat their slaves with respect because they too have a heavenly Lord/Master (v. 9).

<span id="page-109-2"></span>In this passage, Paul neither condones nor condemns slavery explicitly. Instead, he simply provides instructions for how God's people should behave amid the reality of slavery in his day. At the same time, however, Paul never offers a theological foundation for the institution of slavery, as he does for marriage and the differing roles of husband and wife (5:22–33). Rather, Paul provides instructions from a biblical worldview as to how Christian slaves and masters should function in a way that honors God. It was not Paul's *modus operandi* to try to subvert corrupt governments or institutions; rather, he sought to equip the people of God to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord within such realities.

<span id="page-109-1"></span>Paul does affirm the value of human freedom and even encourages those who are slaves to seek their emancipation. In 1 Corinthians 7:21 he tells those who are slaves, "If you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity." Although <span id="page-110-8"></span>he sends Onesimus back to his master, he exhorts Philemon to take Onesimus back not as slave but as a beloved brother (Philem. 16). Paul never positively affirms or supports slavery but instead challenges common attitudes and actions of both slaves and masters.

### EPHESIANS 6:10–20

**<sup>10</sup>**Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. **11**Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. **12**For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. **13**Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. **<sup>14</sup>** Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, **<sup>15</sup>** and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. **<sup>16</sup>** In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; **<sup>17</sup>** and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, **18**praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-110-1"></span><span id="page-110-0"></span>"Finally" signals the beginning of a new paragraph and the conclusion of the body of Ephesians. It also represents a fitting conclusion to the exhortatory material of Paul's letter (4:1–6:20). This paragraph is united by its battle theme and, more specifically, words related to (1) power or strength (6:10); (2) the putting on of armor (vv. 11, 13–16); (3) armor and weaponry (vv. 11, 13–17); (4) enemies (vv. 11–12); and (5) fighting or battle (vv. 11, 13–14, 18).

<span id="page-110-7"></span><span id="page-110-6"></span><span id="page-110-5"></span><span id="page-110-4"></span><span id="page-110-3"></span><span id="page-110-2"></span>The paragraph can be divided into three parts. Part 1 (v. 10) contains a command to be strong with the strength that God provides, serving as a general exhortation over the entire unit. Part 2 (vv. 11–13) consists of an emphatic call to put on the full armor of God, with several reasons why this is necessary. Part 3 (vv. 14–20) continues the exhortation to stand with an explanation of six pieces of armor/ weaponry, accompanied by Paul's statement of the need to persevere in prayer.

Paul draws from the imagery of Isaiah, who depicts Yahweh and his Messiah as a divine warrior clothed with armor as he prepares for battle to defend and <span id="page-111-0"></span>vindicate his people (Isa. 11:4–5; 52:7; 59:17; cf. 1 Thess. 5:8). With this background, Paul calls his readers to use God's armor in order to be ready to stand firm, especially in light of the spiritual warfare that surrounds them, and to be devoted to prayer.

- A. Be Strong in the Lord (6:10)
- B. Put On the Whole Armor of God (6:11–13)
- C. Stand Firm by Employing the Whole Armor of God (6:14–20)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-111-6"></span><span id="page-111-5"></span>6:10 With the word "finally," Paul signals both a new paragraph and also the concluding section of the body of the letter. He urges his readers, "Be strong in the Lord." The imperative "be strong" is in the passive voice and could be translated "be strengthened" or "be made strong." Paul both exhorts his readers to action and also, at the same time, reminds them that the power for such action comes from an external source (cf. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:1)—their union with the Lord Jesus Christ. Amid intense spiritual warfare, the power to fight and stand firm comes through a genuine relationship with the resurrected and ascended Christ. Paul then expands on his previous statement by adding "in the strength of his might," which further explains the source of this empowerment.

<span id="page-111-8"></span><span id="page-111-4"></span><span id="page-111-2"></span><span id="page-111-1"></span>6:11–13 Paul now explicates how believers are to be spiritually equipped to withstand the assault of the enemy: by putting on "the whole armor of God" (v. 11). Although this verb (*endyō*) is the normal term for the putting on of clothes, Paul often uses the verb metaphorically for appropriating the essential characteristics related to the believer's new identity in Christ. For example, he mentions the need to put on (1) the new self (4:24; Col. 3:10); (2) the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27); (3) divine attributes (Col. 3:14); and (4) spiritual armor, including "the armor of light" (Rom. 13:12) and "the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation" (1 Thess. 5:8). Here in Ephesians 6 is Paul's most detailed depiction of such apparel as he describes the "whole armor" ( *panoplia*) of God. This term indicates the full set of armor a Roman foot soldier would wear into battle, although not every piece is listed here; the emphasis is on the full protection the armor supplies. Paul uses battle imagery in several other passages as well (Rom. 13:12; 2 Cor. 6:7; 10:3–6; 1 Tim. 1:18; 2 Tim. 2:3–4). This armor is called the armor "of God" because it is the armor he supplies.

<span id="page-111-7"></span><span id="page-111-3"></span>Paul then provides the all-important reason why this divinely gifted spiritual armor is needed: "that you may be able to stand" (Eph. 6:11). It is significant that believers are not urged to win the victory, for that has already been secured by Christ. Rather, believers are urged to stand firm against the onslaught of the Devil. Paul reminds believers that the Devil is actively planning and strategizing as to how to make them retreat or fall. It is likely, however, that this term conveys more than just the need to stand one's ground and not retreat. The term can also imply a forceful offensive stance against an opponent. The need to stand firm is emphasized, being repeated three more times in this passage ("to withstand" [v. 13], "to stand" [v. 13], "stand" [v. 14]).

<span id="page-112-6"></span><span id="page-112-5"></span><span id="page-112-4"></span>Paul next describes the spiritual nature of the enemy as the reason it is necessary to put on the divinely supplied armor: "We do not wrestle against flesh and blood" (v. 12). The word translated "wrestle" ( *palē*) occurs only here in the Bible and was typically used for the sport of wrestling. With the use of military imagery (such as armor and weaponry), however, it is clear that Paul is envisioning a fierce battle and not merely an athletic competition. He may have used the term to highlight the closeness of the fight: the struggle is not fought by proxy or at a distance but involves close-quarter, hand-to-hand combat.

<span id="page-112-2"></span><span id="page-112-0"></span>Furthermore, this is no ordinary battle. Specifically, it is not "against flesh and blood," an idiom for mankind, particularly in its frailty, weakness, and mortality (Matt. 16:17; 1 Cor. 15:50; Heb. 2:14). This battle is instead "against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." Paul lists four groups: rulers (cf. Eph. 1:21; 3:10), authorities (cf. 1:21; 3:10), cosmic powers, and spiritual forces. These four designations are sometimes viewed as four distinct rankings of evil spirits that together constitute all of the demonic forces. Such a view, however, is difficult to maintain since the relationship between these powers and the Devil is never delineated. In addition, Paul uses several different combinations of terms in such lists (1:21; Col. 1:16). Because we are not given more information, any attempt to catalog or classify evil spirits is pure speculation. What we can be more sure of is that these powers are personal, demonic beings and not merely impersonal social forces or structures of thought.

<span id="page-112-7"></span><span id="page-112-1"></span>The supernatural identification of believers' enemies again becomes the ground for the injunction to take up the God-given armor. Similar to his exhortation in Ephesians 6:11, Paul writes, "Therefore, take up the whole armor of God" (v. 13). The stated reason for the armor in verse 11 was "that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil" but here Paul adds, "that you may be able to withstand in the evil day." Earlier Paul urged his readers to use the time wisely "because the days are evil" (5:16; cf. Gal. 1:4). Although some interpret the "evil day" as referring to (1) a single day of intense persecution and tribulation just prior to the return of Christ or (2) the present age between the two comings of Christ, which will ultimately climax in a final eschatological conflict, it is best to view the "evil day" as (3) the critical times in the lives of believers when demonic attacks are at their worst (cf. Eph. 5:16).

<span id="page-112-3"></span>Finally, Paul reiterates the necessity and importance of being suited with God's armor: ". . . and having done all, to stand firm." This refers to making all the necessary preparations so that every believer is fully armed and thus able to withstand the assault of demonic forces.

<span id="page-113-6"></span>6:14–17 Paul now transitions as he exhorts his readers to stand firm with the armor God supplies. With "therefore," Paul stresses that since the church faces powerful, supernatural opponents, and since God has supplied his people with the resources to resist any attacks by the enemy, believers must stand firm. The command to "stand" is Paul's chief admonition of the entire paragraph, which is seen by its repetition (it occurs 3 times in vv. 11 and 13; cf. 1 Pet. 5:12). The following pieces of armor describe the means by which a believer is able to stand firm.

<span id="page-113-4"></span><span id="page-113-0"></span>First is "the belt of truth" (v. 14). The verb translated "having fastened" ( *perizōnnymi* ) literally means to "gird/prepare oneself." "Since the garment was worn ungirded about the house, girding denotes preparation for an activity."52 In this context, to fasten clothing around one's waist signifies readiness to engage in battle. Paul's imagery and language alludes to Isaiah 11:4–5 (LXX), which includes the description, "He shall be girded with righteousness around the waist and bound with truth around the sides" (NETS). The armor the righteous and truthful Messiah wears in battle is now granted to his people, that they may stand firm amid spiritual warfare. Specifically, this belt is described as the belt of *truth*. That is, as Christians fasten this piece of God's armor, they will be strengthened by the truth of God revealed in the gospel, and consequently they will display the attributes of the Messiah in their attitudes and actions.

<span id="page-113-5"></span><span id="page-113-3"></span><span id="page-113-2"></span>The second piece of armor is "the breastplate of righteousness" (Eph. 6:14). The "breastplate" (*thōrax*) was "a piece of armor covering the chest to protect it against blows and arrows."53 Again Paul's language is reminiscent of Isaiah, where Yahweh is said to "put on righteousness as a breastplate" (Isa. 59:17). Righteousness here refers to an ethical quality (cf. Eph. 4:24; 5:9). The *breastplate* that protects Christians from the assault of the enemy is nothing less than the imitation of the righteous character of God himself. Shunning sin and cultivating holiness in life is impossible without first experiencing the objective gift of God's righteousness, received through faith in Christ.

<span id="page-113-7"></span><span id="page-113-1"></span>The third piece of armor is "shoes for your feet" (6:15). These particular shoes represent "the readiness given by the gospel of peace." Isaiah 52:7 reads, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace." In Ephesians 6, Paul's imagery signifies that those who have their feet properly fitted will be equipped and prepared for spiritual warfare. One debated issue is whether "the readiness of the gospel of peace" (literal translation) means (1) the preparation that comes from the gospel or (2) the readiness to proclaim the gospel. The first option would mean that believers are prepared for spiritual warfare and able to stand firm through the powerful message of the gospel, a message of peace. The focus would then be on the defensive posture of the believer as he keeps his ground, holding steadfast against the forces arrayed against him, since his victory has already been won through the work of Christ. The second option would involve the willingness of the believer to announce the good

<sup>52</sup> BDAG, s.v. ὀσφῦς (1).

<sup>53</sup> J. P. Louw and Eugene Nida, *Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament*, §6.39.

news about Jesus Christ, including the peace Christ brings through reconciling God and man. This view would imply a more offensive posture, seeing the shoes (or soldier's boots) not merely as something to help him hold his position but as something to help him advance into enemy territory in order to attack (cf. Isa. 52:7).

<span id="page-114-4"></span><span id="page-114-2"></span>Fourth is "the shield of faith" (Eph. 6:16). This is not the small, round shield but the large door-shaped shield often carried by Roman soldiers, measuring about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall and 2.5 feet (0.8 m) wide. It was made of wood, overlaid with canvas and leather, and reinforced at the top and bottom with metal. Its outside edges curved inward to offer some protection from a side attack. Because of its size, this shield could protect a soldier's entire body. Such shields, especially when soaked in water, were also specifically designed to extinguish arrows dipped in pitch and set on fire before being shot.54 In the OT, the imagery of a shield was often used to represent God's protection of his people (Gen. 15:1). But the particular shield Paul refers to here is the shield of *faith*. What shields believers is their confidence and trust in God. Because faith is at the very foundation of the Christian walk, it is necessary "in all circumstances," at all times of battle.

<span id="page-114-0"></span>The shield is an important defensive weapon because with it "you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one" (Eph. 6:16). It is by this shield (faith) that believers are able to extinguish the flaming arrows (attacks) of the Evil One (the Devil). The term translated "darts" (*belos*) refers to "a missile, including arrows (propelled by a bow) or darts (hurled by hand)"55—an arrow, dart, spear, or javelin. That the darts are "flaming" indicates the hostile and destructive nature of Satan's attacks (cf. Ps. 7:13; Prov. 26:18).

<span id="page-114-5"></span><span id="page-114-1"></span>The fifth piece of armor is "the helmet of salvation" (Eph. 6:17). Roman soldiers wore a bronze helmet that was essentially a padded metal bowl with guards to protect the brow, cheeks, and neck. Again, Paul's language here echoes Isaiah 59, where Yahweh not only "put on righteousness as a breastplate" but also wore "a helmet of salvation" (Isa. 59:17). Believers already possess salvation, but they must constantly appropriate it by faith.

<span id="page-114-3"></span>The final piece of armor/weaponry is "the sword of the Spirit." This particular sword (*machaira*) was "a relatively short sword (or even dagger) used for cutting and stabbing," designed for close combat.56 The Spirit is the source of the sword, making it powerful and effective. This Spirit-given sword is not a physical sword but is further described as "the word of God." The term for "word" here is not *logos* but *rhēma*, though the terms are often used interchangeably. Here "word of God" refers to the gospel: the offensive weapon given to the believer is the good news of peace and reconciliation that believers embrace and proclaim and that results in standing firm against one's enemies.

<span id="page-114-6"></span>6:18–20 Although the topic of these verses shifts to prayer, they are nevertheless connected to the preceding verses related to spiritual warfare. In fact, it is likely

<sup>54</sup> See Polybius, *Histories* 6.23.2–5.

<sup>55</sup> J. P. Louw and Eugene Nida, *Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament*, §6.36.

<sup>56</sup> Ibid., §6.33. In contrast, the *rhomphaia* was a "large, broad sword used for both cutting and piercing" (§6.32).

<span id="page-115-9"></span>that these verses are directly dependent on the command in verse 14 to "stand" by putting on the full armor of God—Paul is saying that the *means* by which believers stand firm is *prayer*. Prayer should not be viewed as a seventh piece of armor, since no armor/weaponry metaphor is attached to prayer; instead, prayer plays a foundational role for the effective deployment of each piece of armor/weaponry. Prayer epitomizes what it means to be strong in the Lord (6:10).

<span id="page-115-13"></span><span id="page-115-10"></span><span id="page-115-8"></span><span id="page-115-6"></span>Paul amplifies his exhortation to prayer in at least six ways. First, he says that believers should pray constantly ("at all times"; v. 18). Paul has demonstrated the importance of prayer in this letter by recording his own prayers for the Ephesians (1:15–23 and 3:14–21). Here he calls on them to pray continually, or at every opportunity (cf. 1 Thess. 5:17). Second, they are to pray "in the Spirit," recognizing that he guides and empowers believers to pray. Third, they are to pray diligently ("with all prayer and supplication"). The repeated use of prayer terminology emphasizes the need for and importance of believing and expectant prayer. Fourth, they are to pray with alertness ("to that end, keep alert"). If believers are to pray constantly amid intense warfare, they must stay vigilant and alert. Fifth, they are to pray "with all perseverance." This type of prayer characterized the early church (e.g., Acts 1:14; 2:42; 6:4; Rom. 12:12; Col. 4:2). Finally, they are to pray "for all the saints." The ability to stand against the attacks of the Evil One requires believers to pray for one another.

<span id="page-115-14"></span><span id="page-115-11"></span><span id="page-115-4"></span><span id="page-115-1"></span><span id="page-115-0"></span>After encouraging believers to pray for each other, Paul shifts to soliciting prayer for himself ("and also for me"; Eph. 6:19). Paul often included requests for prayer in his letters (Rom. 15:30–32; 2 Cor. 1:11; Col. 4:3–4; 1 Thess. 5:25; 2 Thess. 3:1–2). Interestingly, Paul asks for prayer not so that he would be released from prison but so that he would faithfully convey the gospel message ("that words may be given to me in opening my mouth"), probably in the context of his trial as a prisoner of Rome. Knowing the seriousness of his situation and the intimidating atmosphere of his imprisonment, Paul also asks that he would be able to speak "boldly" (Eph. 6:19). Paul desires to share the gospel message freely, clearly, and candidly. Specifically, Paul seeks to communicate the "mystery of the gospel," the revelation that Jews and Gentiles become the one people of God through their common faith in the Lord Jesus.

<span id="page-115-7"></span><span id="page-115-5"></span><span id="page-115-3"></span>Paul then says that it is because of this gospel that he is "an ambassador in chains" (v. 20; cf. 2 Cor. 5:20). Paul is an official representative of God with the distinct commission of making known the mystery of the gospel to the Gentiles (cf. Eph. 3:2, 7–8). Because Paul's imprisonment involved his being under house arrest (Acts 28:30–31), some interpret his reference to "chains" merely as a figurative picture of his imprisonment. Others, however, claim that it refers to specific chains binding Paul to a Roman soldier (Acts 28:16, 20). Either way, Paul speaks with irony here, since an ambassador should never be in chains. Typically, ambassadors were given special privileges, including immunity, because they spoke with the authority of a foreign power.

<span id="page-115-12"></span><span id="page-115-2"></span>Paul also asks for prayer that he "may declare [the gospel] boldly" (Eph. 6:20). Obviously, the need to preach the gospel boldly amid his circumstances was <span id="page-116-10"></span><span id="page-116-8"></span>important to Paul, as this request was already mentioned in verse 19. Paul's overwhelming compulsion to share the good news about Jesus Christ is related to his divine calling, and thus this message is something he "ought to speak." Evidence for the answer to Paul's request can perhaps be found in 2 Timothy 4:17, which states that the Lord stood by Paul and gave him strength so that the message of the gospel could be preached to the Gentiles.

### *Response*

### THE REALITY OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE

<span id="page-116-2"></span>Although today many Westerners deny the existence of spiritual powers, such powers are readily acknowledged by people of other cultures, and by the biblical authors as well. In Ephesians Paul offers his most sustained treatment of the spiritual forces battling believers. He uses the terms "devil" (v. 11) and "evil one" (v. 16) to refer to Satan, earlier described as "the prince of the power of the air" (2:2). Satan appears to be the leader of other evil spirits labeled "rulers," "authorities," "cosmic powers," and "spiritual forces" (6:12), who are determined to harm God's people.

### <span id="page-116-3"></span><span id="page-116-0"></span>THE RESPONSE TO SPIRITUAL WARFARE

<span id="page-116-4"></span><span id="page-116-1"></span>The proper response in light of this largely unseen reality is to be prepared. Paul's first imperative to believers is to "be strong in the Lord" (v. 10). Satan and his minions are well armed and can easily defeat or discourage weary soldiers of the cross. The strength to fight and overcome the enemy is supplied by God. Only by "the strength of his might" are we in a position to take a stand against the Devil. In using the verb "stand" (including "withstand") four times (vv. 11, 13 [2x], 14), Paul emphasizes the need for believers to be prepared so that they will be able to endure whatever assaults come their way. The Trinity as the divine source of power is highlighted throughout this passage. God the Father, the Divine Warrior, makes his armor and weaponry available to us: it is the full armor "of God" (vv. 11, 13). Specifically, we are told to take up the "word of God" (v. 17). God the Son, who is now the exalted Lord seated at the Father's right hand, is the one who strengthens believers: we are to "be strong in the Lord" (v. 10). God the Spirit likewise provides the Christian soldier with the sword of the word (v. 17). We are also instructed to pray "in the Spirit" (v. 18).

### <span id="page-116-7"></span><span id="page-116-6"></span>THE RESULTS OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE

<span id="page-116-9"></span><span id="page-116-5"></span>Although some believe that Paul's imagery and explanation of the armor indicates that Christians are to take only a defensive stand, this perspective is probably too narrow. The shoes signifying "the readiness given by the gospel of peace" (v. 15) suggest that we should be prepared to advance the gospel message wherever God calls us. The "sword of the Spirit" (v. 17) represents the word of God, especially as it is proclaimed amid the darkness and as it liberates people from the dominion of Satan. The readiness to go on the offensive is also modeled by Paul himself as he asks for prayer that he might preach the gospel boldly (vv. 19–20). When we heed

<span id="page-117-0"></span>Paul's instruction, we will find success against the schemes of the Devil if we are faithful in prayer. Without prayer, the armor and weapons needed for battle will not be effectively employed. We are to pray "in the Spirit" so that our prayers will be led and empowered by the Spirit. In addition, prayer is to be made "at all times," "with all prayer and supplication," "with all perseverance," and "for all the saints" (v. 18). With these exhortations Paul is stressing the need for and importance of prayer in order to stand successfully against the Devil and his forces.

### EPHESIANS 6:21–24

**<sup>21</sup>** So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything. **<sup>22</sup>** I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-117-3"></span><span id="page-117-2"></span>This section contains Paul's concluding remarks to the saints in Ephesus and can be divided into two parts: (1) a commendation of Tychicus and his task (Eph. 6:21–22) and (2) a final benediction (vv. 23–24). Paul describes Tychicus (probably the bearer of the letter) as a "beloved brother" and "faithful minister." Tychicus was sent to the Ephesian believers for two main reasons: to explain Paul's current situation and to encourage their hearts. In the final two verses Paul offers a benediction (a prayer invoking God's blessings on others) for the recipients to experience God's peace, love, faith, and grace. This passage is strikingly similar to Colossians 4:7–8, suggesting that both letters were authored by Paul at roughly the same time and were carried by Tychicus from Rome to their respective recipients.

- A. Commendation of Tychicus (6:21–22)
- B. Benediction of Peace, Love, Faith, and Grace (6:23–24)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-117-1"></span>6:21 Paul's brief comments focus on the letter's probable courier, Tychicus. He was one of Paul's most trusted associates, often accompanying Paul on his journeys

<span id="page-118-11"></span><span id="page-118-0"></span>and occasionally being sent on important missions (Acts 20:4; Col. 4:7–9; 2 Tim. 4:12; Titus 3:12). "Brother" here signifies "coworker" or "helper" and not merely a "fellow believer."

<span id="page-118-7"></span>Paul conveys to the Ephesian Christians that he is sending Tychicus to them for two reasons. First, Tychicus will supply them with additional information concerning Paul's circumstances, which he states (in various ways) three times: (1) "that you also may know how I am" (Eph. 6:21); (2) ". . . and what I am doing" (v. 21); and (3) "that you may know how we are" (v. 22). Essentially, Paul is informing them that Tychicus will relay to them a firsthand account of Paul's situation in prison. Second, Tychicus is sent to encourage their hearts (v. 22). These two purposes are perhaps related, since the Ephesian believers would certainly have been encouraged to learn of Paul's health, his imprisonment, and how God was using Paul to bring the gospel to the Gentiles.

<span id="page-118-9"></span><span id="page-118-8"></span><span id="page-118-1"></span>6:23–24 Finally, Paul prays for the recipients of the letter. His first prayer is one of peace and love (with faith): "Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (v. 23). The term "peace" was often used in benedictions at the end of letters (Rom. 15:33; Gal. 6:16; 2 Thess. 3:16; 1 Pet. 5:14; 3 John 15), and its prominent position at the head of this benediction could be due to its significant role as a theme of the letter (Eph. 2:14–18; 4:3; 6:15).

<span id="page-118-12"></span><span id="page-118-5"></span><span id="page-118-4"></span><span id="page-118-3"></span>The themes of "love" (2:4; 3:14–19; 5:1–2) and "faith" (1:13; 2:8; 3:17–19; 6:16) have also played important roles throughout Ephesians. Interestingly, Paul does not use the normal form "peace to you" but instead writes, "peace to the brothers," which perhaps fits with the idea of a circular, less personal letter. Paul writes to members of various house churches who belong to the same household (2:19) and are members of one another (4:25). Because of the peace they possess due to their union with Christ and one another, they can be called "brothers." This divine blessing comes "from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

<span id="page-118-10"></span><span id="page-118-6"></span><span id="page-118-2"></span>Paul's second prayer is a closing benediction focusing on grace: "Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible" (6:24). Grace has been a theme emphasized by Paul throughout this letter (1:6, 7; 2:5, 7, 8; 4:7). Again Paul does not use the more common form "Grace be with *you*" but instead says, "Grace be with *all who love our Lord Jesus Christ*," emphasizing the believer's personal relationship with Christ, which is characterized by love. Finally, the love of believers is described as "incorruptible." Most likely, Paul is saying that the ideal Christian love is *persistent* or *undying*. This love is not affected by death; it is an unceasing and endless love toward Christ. This love is possible only because of the love believers first experienced from God.

### *Response*

This brief conclusion gives us another glimpse into the life and ministry of Paul and his coworkers. First, we learn that Paul always served with a team. It appears that whenever Paul traveled, planted churches, strengthened believers, or was <span id="page-119-2"></span><span id="page-119-0"></span>imprisoned, he always had other dedicated believers around him. In Ephesians we read of Tychicus, who went to Rome to help Paul. We know from Acts 20:4 that he accompanied Paul on his third missionary journey. Having become Paul's faithful companion, Tychicus was sent from Rome as an emissary to Ephesus (Eph. 6:21–22) and Colossae (Col. 4:7–8). Later, Paul made plans to send Tychicus (or Artemas) to the island of Crete so that Titus would be able to visit Paul at Nicopolis (Titus 3:12). Finally, Tychicus was sent back to Ephesus in order to replace Timothy and was probably also the bearer of 2 Timothy (2 Tim. 4:12). Paul was constantly investing in and relying on people like Tychicus, Titus, and Timothy to help him in his efforts to share the gospel and build up the churches. From Paul's example we can learn to invest in others who can join us in fulfilling the Great Commission.

<span id="page-119-6"></span><span id="page-119-5"></span><span id="page-119-4"></span><span id="page-119-3"></span><span id="page-119-1"></span>Second, we learn that Paul ultimately relied on God. Paul not only began his letter with an extended praise to God, who has blessed his people with every spiritual blessing; he also concludes with a double benediction as he prays for the Ephesian believers. In addition, Paul twice prayed for his readers in the course of writing the letter (1:15–23; 3:14–21) and exhorts them to prayer as well (6:18–19). Paul is constantly demonstrating that God is the source of all blessing and strength in our lives. In particular, Paul's benedictory prayer in 6:23–24 highlights God as the source of peace, love, faith, and grace. More than simply a formality at the end of a letter, Paul is earnestly asking for God's blessing on the saints in Ephesus. Instead of being consumed with his own difficult circumstances and imprisonment, Paul was considering others more significant than himself (cf. Phil. 2:3–4). Likewise, we should be quick to praise God for all things, even when we ourselves are facing difficult circumstances.

# PHILIPPIANS

*Jason C. Meyer*

## INTRODUCTION TO PHILIPPIANS <sup>1</sup>

### *Overview*

<span id="page-123-1"></span>Philippians burns with the blazing centrality of the gospel of Christ. The gospel provides a strong sense of coherence and unity to the whole letter. Paul's opening greeting celebrates the identity that he and the Philippians share through the gospel (Phil. 1:1–2). His prayer of thanksgiving (1:3–8) highlights their partnership in the gospel as God has made them both partakers of grace. Paul's prayer of intercession boldly asks for greater gospel fruit to abound in their lives (1:9–11).

<span id="page-123-8"></span><span id="page-123-6"></span><span id="page-123-5"></span><span id="page-123-4"></span><span id="page-123-3"></span><span id="page-123-2"></span>The main body of the letter opens with an update from Paul concerning the surprising advance of the gospel despite his imprisonment (1:12–26). The thesis of the letter comes with his call to live "worthy of the gospel of Christ" (1:27) as the Philippians stand firm and strive side by side to advance "the faith of the gospel" (1:27–30). Fulfilling this call to walk worthy of the gospel requires a unified gospel mind-set (2:1–4), which shines supremely in the mind of Christ (2:5–11) but also is exemplified in the lives of both Timothy (2:19–24) and Epaphroditus (2:25–30), who put the needs of others before their own for the sake of the gospel. Walking worthy of the gospel is applied with specific exhortations to the Philippians to work out their salvation without grumbling as they shine like stars in the world (2:12–18). Paul then responds to threats to the progress of the gospel: false teachers and their false gospel (3:2–21) and disunity among the Philippians (4:2–3). The letter concludes with a final thanksgiving and greeting (4:10–23) that once again stresses their partnership in the gospel through their financial gifts.

### <span id="page-123-10"></span><span id="page-123-9"></span><span id="page-123-7"></span>*Title*

<span id="page-123-0"></span>Paul addressed this letter to the saints in Christ Jesus "who are at Philippi" (Phil. 1:1). The city of Philippi was best known in the ancient world as the site of the battle in which Antony and Octavian emerged victorious over Brutus and Cassius (the assassins of Julius Caesar) in 42 BC. Octavian later defeated Antony (31 BC), rebuilt Philippi, and gave it the *ius italicum* (Italian Right), the highest privilege a colony could obtain.2 The city enjoyed a storied history long before these events. It

was founded by Philip II of Macedon in 358–357 BC, who named it after himself. The site was situated in a very fertile region 8 miles (12.9 km) from the Aegean Sea and enjoyed an abundance of springs and of gold (Strabo, *Geographica* 7.331). Philippi became part of the Roman Empire in 168 BC and prospered due to its strategic location along the Via Egnatia (the main land route between Rome and the East). The Acts narrative reveals that the church in Philippi was the first church Paul planted in Europe, c. AD 49–50 (Acts 16:6–40).

### <span id="page-124-0"></span>*Author*

Scholarly acceptance of Paul's authorship is so widespread that an extended discussion is unnecessary. The letter is accepted as Pauline because: (1) it opens with the words "from Paul" and (2) the early church acknowledged Paul's authorship without dissent.3 The intensely personal nature of the letter further attests to its authenticity. Paul spends significant time discussing his personal circumstances at the beginning (1:12–26) and end (4:10–20). He gives himself as an example multiple times (3:4–14), and first-person pronouns abound.

<span id="page-124-8"></span><span id="page-124-6"></span>The turning point in Paul's story is one of the most radical conversions in human history. Saul of Tarsus was a Pharisee and a zealous persecutor of the church. The risen Lord Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus while Saul was traveling to persecute Christians. After his conversion, Saul became perhaps the greatest missionary, theologian, and author in church history, writing thirteen canonical letters.

### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-124-3"></span>The most probable date for Philippians is sometime between AD 60 and 62, during Paul's imprisonment in Rome.4 Paul refers to his imprisonment in each of the so-called Prison Epistles (Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20; Phil. 1:7, 13, 14, 16, 17; Col. 4:3, 10; Philem. 1, 9, 10, 13, 23). According to Luke, Paul spent two years in Rome under house arrest, which included the freedom to receive visitors (Acts 28:30).

<span id="page-124-9"></span><span id="page-124-7"></span><span id="page-124-1"></span>Paul's comments in Philippians suggest several pastoral problems and personal concerns. First, Paul had apparently heard a report of disunity among the Philippians, including a specific conflict between two women in the church, Euodia and Syntyche. Paul urges them to be united in harmony in the Lord (Phil. 4:2). Second, Paul sounds a serious warning against false teachers and all those who walk as "enemies of the cross" (3:2–21).

<span id="page-124-5"></span>Paul also mentions numerous personal concerns. He gives the Philippians an update concerning his own circumstances and the advancement of the gospel (1:12–26). He regards the Philippians as partners in the gospel (1:5) who labor in

<span id="page-124-4"></span><span id="page-124-2"></span><sup>3</sup> The early church fathers Polycarp of Smyrna, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian all unanimously accepted Pauline authorship. This consensus was momentarily questioned in the nineteenth century by thinkers like F. C. Baur. Baur concluded that Paul wrote only Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. Baur's views have not convinced many.

<sup>4</sup> The date for Philippians depends on the place of writing. A date as early as AD 54 or as late as 62 is possible. The traditional dating of Paul's Roman imprisonment would place the letter in the early 60s. If Paul wrote from Ephesus, the letter could be dated between 54 and 57.

<span id="page-125-10"></span><span id="page-125-7"></span>prayer for him (1:19), and thus naturally Paul wants to inform them of his own personal situation and its relationship to the greater goal of gospel progress. There is evidence of three other personal concerns: (1) Paul commends Timothy so that the Philippians will welcome him when he comes (2:19–23); (2) he informs the Philippians of his own desire to visit them in the future (2:24); (3) he reports on Epaphroditus and his illness (2:25–30).

### <span id="page-125-12"></span><span id="page-125-11"></span>*Genre and Literary Structure*

<span id="page-125-16"></span><span id="page-125-5"></span><span id="page-125-4"></span><span id="page-125-2"></span><span id="page-125-1"></span>Philippians belongs to the epistolary genre and thus shares common features with other NT epistles. It includes an opening greeting (1:1–2) and thanksgiving/ prayer (vv. 3–11) and ends with another thanksgiving (4:10–20) and final greetings (vv. 21–23). The body of the letter does not follow the structure Paul uses in some of his other letters, in which a doctrinal section (Romans 1–11; Ephesians 1–3; Colossians 1–2) is followed by an ethical or application section (Romans 12–16; Ephesians 4–6; Colossians 3–4). Instead, the body of Philippians focuses on exhortations and examples (cf. outline below). Paul crafts a clear thesis statement (Phil. 1:27–30) and repeats three key terms to mark the end of the body (3:20–4:3), creating a "bookend" effect, often called an inclusio (see table 2.1).

### <span id="page-125-9"></span><span id="page-125-3"></span><span id="page-125-0"></span>TABLE 2.1: The Bookend Effect in Philippians

<span id="page-125-13"></span>Students of ancient letter writing sometimes call Philippians a "letter of friendship." Others have compared Philippians to the genre of "family letters." Despite the clear insights these studies have offered, the "friendship" or "family" approach has difficulty accounting for the place of 3:1–4:9 and 4:10–20 in the letter, and some question how much actual light such designations shed on the letter as a whole.5

### *Theology of Philippians*

### THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST

<span id="page-125-8"></span>Philippians is a sustained, impassioned plea for the centrality of the gospel and for its practical implications. This is seen most comprehensively in Philippians 1:27: live your life in a manner "worthy of the gospel." Acts of personal and practical

<span id="page-125-6"></span><sup>5</sup> Moisés Silva in particular has detailed doubts about the friendship model. For him the specific issue is, "Nowhere in Philippians does Paul make explicit reference (or unambiguous allusion) to the Greco-Roman concept of friendship," and "The main body of the letter (from 1:12 to the end of ch. 3) provides very little evidence, if any, in support of this view" (Moisés Silva, *Philippians,* 2nd ed., BECNT [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2005], 19).

obedience (unity, humility, rejoicing; avoiding grumbling or anxiety) not only arise *from* the gospel but are also necessary *for* the gospel and its advance.

### THE PERSON OF CHRIST

<span id="page-126-9"></span><span id="page-126-8"></span>Philippians celebrates the supremacy of Jesus Christ, especially in the "Christ hymn" (2:6–11), which surveys (1) the wonders of Christ's preexistent state (v. 6), (2) his humble obedience to the Father in every respect (vv. 7–8), and (3) his exalted position as the Lord to whom every knee will bow and every tongue confess (vv. 9–11).

<span id="page-126-10"></span><span id="page-126-4"></span>This great passage should not cause readers to neglect the many other passages in Philippians that testify to the centrality of Christ. Few Pauline passages can compare with Philippians 1:21–23 and 3:7–11 in terms of expressing Paul's all-consuming passion to honor Christ and know him more in this life and the life to come. References to Christ saturate the entire letter, as seen in phrases such as "in Christ," "in him," or "in the Lord." These expressions either convey union with Christ (1:1, 14, 29; 3:9; 4:21) or stress an action in response to or on the basis of Jesus' person, work, and lordship:

- <span id="page-126-1"></span><span id="page-126-0"></span>• imprisonment is "for Christ" (1:13; lit., "in Christ")
- <span id="page-126-2"></span>• confidence "in the Lord" (1:14)
- <span id="page-126-3"></span>• to live "is Christ" (1:21)
- <span id="page-126-5"></span>• glory "in Christ" (1:26; 3:3)
- <span id="page-126-6"></span>• encouragement "in Christ" (2:1)
- <span id="page-126-7"></span>• the mind-set of Christ (2:5)
- <span id="page-126-11"></span>• hoping "in the Lord Jesus" (2:19)
- <span id="page-126-12"></span>• trusting "in the Lord" (2:24)
- <span id="page-126-13"></span>• receiving others "in the Lord" (2:29)
- <span id="page-126-14"></span>• rejoicing "in the Lord" (3:1; 4:4, 10),
- <span id="page-126-16"></span>• pressing on toward the call of God "in Christ" (3:14)
- <span id="page-126-17"></span>• standing firm "in the Lord" (4:1)
- <span id="page-126-18"></span>• agreeing "in the Lord" (4:2)
- <span id="page-126-19"></span>• guarding hearts and minds "in Christ Jesus" (4:7)
- <span id="page-126-20"></span>• supplying needs according to riches "in Christ Jesus" (4:19)
- <span id="page-126-21"></span>• the grace "of the Lord Jesus Christ" (4:23)

### JOY IN CHRIST

<span id="page-126-15"></span>Paul uses the noun and verbal forms of "rejoice" and "rejoice with" sixteen times in this short letter. Philippians thus testifies to the deep-rooted reality of joy in the life of a follower of Christ. Delight in Christ is not an optional aspect of Christianity but an essential outgrowth of union with him in the gospel. Joy is an inevitable overflow of progressively perceiving the "surpassing worth" of knowing Christ Jesus as Lord (3:8). Rejoicing in the Lord is also a safeguard (3:1) against all forms of false teaching that seek to make much of the flesh rather than of Christ.

#### SUFFERING FOR CHRIST

<span id="page-127-20"></span><span id="page-127-12"></span><span id="page-127-10"></span><span id="page-127-8"></span>Suffering is an important theological theme often neglected in studying Philippians. Paul's trying circumstances have served to advance the gospel (1:12–13). He faces the prospect of death in his imprisonment (1:20–21), and Epaphroditus almost died in the cause of the gospel as well (2:27). In the Philippians' fight for the faith of the gospel (1:27) they too will meet opposition and suffering but must respond without fear (1:28). They must regard their suffering, like their faith, as a gracious gift from God (1:29). This experience of conflict mirrors Paul's suffering, which the Philippians witnessed in the past and now hear about in the present (1:30).

<span id="page-127-24"></span><span id="page-127-23"></span><span id="page-127-21"></span><span id="page-127-17"></span><span id="page-127-15"></span><span id="page-127-14"></span><span id="page-127-13"></span>Paul mentions the suffering of Christ on the cross (2:8) and regards his own suffering as a fellowship in Christ's sufferings and conformity to his death (3:10). Furthermore, Paul can endure suffering (like hunger and poverty; 4:12) through the strength Christ gives (4:13). Joy and suffering are especially illuminating themes in light of Paul's rejoicing at midnight in a Philippian prison after being beaten with rods (Acts 16:16–25).

### <span id="page-127-7"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-127-4"></span><span id="page-127-3"></span>Even though Philippians does not contain any explicit OT quotations, Paul's use of the OT is surprisingly rich and deep at key places in the letter. He draws upon Job 13:16 to express his confident assurance of salvation (Phil. 1:19), while Psalm 34:3–5 provides a bright backdrop for his expectation that he would not be put to shame in anything, while Christ would be magnified (Phil. 1:20). The thesis section of 1:27–29 borrows language and imagery of the salvation of God's people and destruction of God's enemies at the exodus (Ex. 14:13).

<span id="page-127-19"></span><span id="page-127-16"></span><span id="page-127-9"></span><span id="page-127-5"></span><span id="page-127-0"></span>The "Christ hymn" of Philippians 2:6–11 is a poetic intertextual tapestry that skillfully weaves together threads from Isaiah 45:14–25 and 52:13–53:12. The most striking similarity is the unique progression of thought, in both passages, from exaltation to humiliation and then back to exaltation. The following passage (Phil. 2:12–17) draws upon several OT passages to describe a contrast between the disobedience of the Israelites as the old covenant people of God and the obedience of the Philippians as God's new covenant people (cf. Ex. 16:7–12; Num. 17:5, 10; Deut. 31:27; 32:5). The Philippians shine like the stars of Daniel 12 as they hold strong to God's words (Phil. 2:15–16; cf. Dan. 12:3). The commentary will highlight other echoes of the OT that Paul employs throughout Philippians.

### <span id="page-127-6"></span><span id="page-127-2"></span><span id="page-127-1"></span>*Preaching from Philippians*

<span id="page-127-22"></span><span id="page-127-18"></span><span id="page-127-11"></span>Philippians is pure expositional gold. Many people count it as one of their favorite books because of its many familiar and well-loved verses and phrases, such as, "To live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Phil. 1:21); "God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name" (2:9); "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice" (4:4); "I can do all things through him who strengthens me" (4:13). The blessing of preaching through Philippians in an expository way is that the preacher can show how these familiar phrases fit together to form one profoundly challenging and inspiring message. People will love Philippians even more when they can see it as one grand picture instead of many disconnected pieces.

### *Interpretive Challenges*

<span id="page-128-4"></span>The question of place of writing (sometimes called "provenance") is one of the most contested issues concerning Philippians. Paul clearly identifies himself as a prisoner (1:7, 13, 17), but he does not explicitly state the location of this imprisonment. The Philippians knew the place of imprisonment and thus did not need to be told. The two main contenders for the place of writing are Rome and Ephesus.

<span id="page-128-5"></span><span id="page-128-1"></span><span id="page-128-0"></span>The traditional view places this imprisonment in Rome. A Roman imprisonment hypothesis would account for: (1) the mentions of the "imperial guard" (or "praetorium"; 1:13 ESV mg.) and Caesar's household (4:22); (2) the loose restrictions implied by his activity during his imprisonment (e.g., 1:12–13; cf. Acts 28:16, 30–31); (3) references to a seemingly well-established church (1:14); (4) external evidence (the Marcionite prologue to Philippians), and (5) the "life or death" nature of this imprisonment—Paul could have appealed to Caesar while under any other imprisonment.

Until recent times, the Roman hypothesis was held almost universally. However, scholars began to point out two main areas of weakness in this traditional view, related to geography and Paul's travel plans. First, the distance between Philippi and Rome (about 1,200 miles/1,900 km) renders as problematic the number of journeys implied in Philippians (perhaps as many as seven). Second, Romans mentions Paul's intention to travel to Spain (Rom. 15:24, 28), while Philippians states that Paul plans to visit Philippi if he is released (Phil. 2:24).

<span id="page-128-7"></span><span id="page-128-3"></span><span id="page-128-2"></span>Since 1897, the Roman hypothesis has been eclipsed by the Ephesian hypothesis, first set forward by Adolf Deissmann. This view currently enjoys broad support for the following reasons: (1) Paul's mention of many imprisonments (2 Cor. 11:23) (despite there being no mention in Acts of an Ephesian imprisonment); (2) the close proximity of Ephesus to Philippi; (3) the close literary affinity of Philippians to Paul's earlier letters; (4) inscriptions showing that a section of the imperial guard was stationed at Ephesus; and (5) Paul's failure to mention Luke, who was with him in Rome (2 Tim. 4:11) but probably not during his Ephesian ministry (the stint in Ephesus not being a first-person section in Acts).

<span id="page-128-8"></span><span id="page-128-6"></span>However, the Ephesian hypothesis also faces some objections: (1) the theory is built on implicit inferences, because there is no explicit mention of an imprisonment in Ephesus; (2) the Ephesian church does not seem to be divided over Paul, as a reading of Philippians would require, if one were to accept this hypothesis; (3) the collection for the poor saints in Jerusalem was of central importance during Paul's Ephesian ministry, but there is no hint of it in Philippians; and (4) Paul speaks somewhat harshly about those around him except for Timothy (Phil. 2:19–21), which would be a strange way to characterize Ephesus, since his friends Priscilla and Aquila were there at the same time as Paul.

The choice between Rome and Ephesus is exceedingly difficult. Scholars weigh the geographical arguments against a Roman imprisonment in various ways. Some treat it as the lynchpin issue, while others regard it as irrelevant. Many scholars occupy a middle position and acknowledge the geographical arguments are somewhat exaggerated by both camps. The supposed literary affinities between Philippians and earlier letters may not lend any persuasive proof either way.

The arguments for Philippians being written from Rome are slightly stronger because they assume a known imprisonment, enjoy some external evidence, and have a long-standing tradition. These considerations put the burden of proof on the Ephesian hypothesis.

1 Paul and Timothy, servants*<sup>1</sup>* of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers*<sup>2</sup>*

and deacons:*<sup>3</sup>*

**<sup>2</sup>**Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. **<sup>3</sup>** I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, **<sup>4</sup>** always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, **5**because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. **6**And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. **<sup>7</sup>** It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace,*<sup>4</sup>* both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. **<sup>8</sup>**For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. **9**And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, **<sup>10</sup>** so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, **<sup>11</sup>**filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

### *Section Overview*

Ancient writers would sometimes begin and end a letter with the same language or theme as a literary framing device (what we're calling a "bookend" or inclusio), giving the letter a thematic unity. Paul ties the threads of Philippians together by both beginning and ending with (1) a grace greeting and (2) an expression of thanksgiving for gospel partnership. In other words, God's gospel grace in Christ and Paul's gratitude for the Philippians' partnership in the gospel gives Philippians its thematic unity. The parallels can be seen at a glance in table 2.2.

Paul follows this fourfold pattern, but not in a prepacked, perfunctory way. He takes these four categories and profoundly transforms them into Christ-exalting categories. First, Christ is exalted as the key to understanding the *identity of Christian ministers* like Paul and Timothy (i.e., "servants of Christ"). Second, Christ is exalted as the key to unlocking *the identity of Christians* (i.e., "saints in Christ"). Third, Christ is exalted as the *fountain of grace and peace* ("from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"). Fourth, Christ is exalted as the *high point of history and holiness* as Paul gives thanks and prays for the purity of the Philippians ("filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ"; 1:11) in light of the final day ("the day of Christ"; Phil. 1:10).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-134-4"></span>1:1 Both Paul and Timothy are named as authors, but evidence from within the letter itself points to Paul as the primary author.6 Paul and Timothy declare and celebrate their status as slaves of Christ. The word translated "servants" refers specifically to a "slave" (*doulos*). Serving informs every aspect of a slave's existence. "Slaves of Christ" testifies to the upside-down power of Christianity. No one would celebrate being a slave in the ancient world, but Christ taught his disciples to appreciate the true greatness of servanthood (Mark 10:42–44), especially as seen in his own example of coming not to be served but to serve (Mark 10:45). Paul's status as a slave of Christ is certainly in sync with the later celebration of Christ as the ultimate "slave" (*doulos*) in Philippians 2:7.

<span id="page-134-9"></span><span id="page-134-8"></span><span id="page-134-1"></span><span id="page-134-0"></span>The recipients of the letter are "all the saints in Christ Jesus." The emphasis on "all" highlights the importance of unity, a theme that will reappear at several key junctures (Phil. 1:27–2:18; 3:15–4:9). That the Philippians are saints through union with Christ teaches them to treasure their Christian identity above their earthly identity. Philippi was a Roman colony, and people from Philippi prided themselves in their Roman citizenship. Yet Christ reigns far above all earthly powers, and thus the Philippians should exult far more in the fact that they are saints "in Christ" and citizens of *his* kingdom. The fact that they live "in Philippi" means, however, that they must carry out their kingdom citizenship in the context of Rome's pretentious claims of allegiance.

<span id="page-134-3"></span>The inclusion of "overseers and deacons" as specific recipients of this letter stands out. No other Pauline letter includes a reference to church leaders in its opening. Paul mentions "overseers" (*episkopos*) first (v. 1). The NT uses this term to refer to church leaders, synonymous with "elders" (Acts 20:17, 28; 1 Tim. 3:1–2; 5:17; Titus 1:5, 7; 1 Pet. 5:1). The Bible stresses that Christ is the Chief Shepherd of the flock, who exercises authoritative oversight of his churches by giving them under-shepherds to watch over the flock (1 Pet. 5:1–4).

<span id="page-134-15"></span><span id="page-134-14"></span><span id="page-134-13"></span><span id="page-134-2"></span>"Deacons" refers to an office in the church that aims to meet its practical needs. Deacons were originally selected to free the apostles to focus on the "ministry of the word" and prayer (Acts 6:1–6), and Paul gives guidance for selecting deacons as officers in the church (1 Tim. 3:8–12). The fact that Paul refers to both overseers and deacons could anticipate the role they will play in resolving the conflict between Euodia and Syntyche (Phil. 4:2–3).

<span id="page-134-12"></span><span id="page-134-5"></span>1:2 Paul celebrates grace and peace as gospel gifts. It was common for ancient letters to open with a greeting, but Paul replaces the generic greeting with a theologically charged one by shifting the standard "greeting" (*charein*) to "grace" (*charis*). Grace is often understood as God's unmerited favor toward sinners, but terms like "unmerited" or "undeserved" are inadequate to define grace. Grace is given to those

<span id="page-134-11"></span><span id="page-134-10"></span><span id="page-134-7"></span><span id="page-134-6"></span><sup>6</sup> The thanksgiving and prayer of intercession (1:3–11) are both first person singular. Paul spends significant time discussing his personal circumstances at the beginning (1:12–26) and end (4:10–20) of the letter. He gives himself as an example multiple times (3:4–14), and first person pronouns abound. He personally commends Timothy (2:19–24) and Epaphroditus (2:25–30).

who deserve wrath, and thus grace is "not so much undeserved as ill-deserved"; we have "done everything to deserve the exact opposite of grace."7 The immeasurable gap between the infinite wrath we deserve and the infinite kindness we receive is what makes grace so amazing.

<span id="page-135-0"></span>Paul adds "peace" to the greeting, celebrating the staggering truth that people who were once enemies of God now enjoy peace with him through the blood of Christ (Rom. 5:1; Col. 1:19–23). Grace and peace are gospel gifts that come to sinners only "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." The Father planned this great salvation, and the Son purchased it.

<span id="page-135-3"></span><span id="page-135-2"></span>1:3 Verses 3–6 are one sentence in Greek and shine with a glowing sense of gratitude. Paul thanks God every time the Philippians come to mind. His thankfulness comes through in the occurrences of "all," "always," and "every" in verses 3–4.

<span id="page-135-4"></span><span id="page-135-1"></span>1:4 As verse 3 makes the point that Paul thanks God for the Philippians, verse 4 fleshes out how he gives thanks: in prayer. Prayer is clearly not a dull duty for Paul. His prayers burn with both gratitude (v. 3) and joy (v. 4). We must distinguish between worldly joy and Christian joy; worldly joy requires delightful circumstances, while Christian joy depends on deep-seated delight in Christ, not circumstances. Elisabeth Elliot said it well: "The secret is Christ in me, not me in a different set of circumstances."8

<span id="page-135-5"></span>1:5 If verse 3 is the "what" and verse 4 the "how," then verse 5 is the "why." Paul reveals the main reason he is so thankful for the Philippians: their partnership with him in the gospel. "Partnership" (*koinōnia*) is often translated as "fellowship," but it is much more than warm feelings of friendship. The term frequently has the commercial overtones of a business partnership and suggests a robust commitment extending beyond mere emotions. As D. A. Carson writes, "There may be overtones of warmth and intimacy, but the heart of the matter is this shared vision of what is of transcendent importance, a vision that calls forth our commitment."9

<span id="page-135-8"></span><span id="page-135-6"></span>1:6 What is the "good work" that God began and will complete? It is the entire work of salvation.10 Since salvation did not begin with the will of man (cf. Phil. 1:29), it follows that its completion cannot decisively depend upon the power of man. The God-centered nature of salvation is good news because man is fickle but God is faithful to finish what he starts. God's work will come to full completion "at the day of Jesus Christ." Paul's focus on the "day of Jesus Christ" fills Philippians with a pervasive hope of glory (cf. 1:10; 2:10–11, 2:16; 3:20–21).

<sup>10</sup> Some argue that the "good work" is Paul's financial partnership with the Philippians. See Gerald F. Hawthorne and Ralph P. Martin, *Philippians*, rev. ed., WBC (Dallas: Word, 2004), 24–25. P. T. O'Brien makes a much better case for the view that the "good work" refers to salvation. See O'Brien, *Philippians,* NIGTC (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1991), 64–65.

<span id="page-136-5"></span><span id="page-136-4"></span>1:7 At first glance it seems like this verse simply states that Paul's feelings are appropriate ("right"). In fact, he says much more. "To feel" could also be translated "to think" ( *phroneō*). It refers to a "mind-set" and is one of the unifying themes of the letter.11 Paul is saying, "It is right for me to think this way about you all." The content of his mind-set ("this way") refers back to verses 3–6. Paul is thankful for their saving participation and partnership in the gospel (vv. 3–6); they are fellow partakers of grace with Paul in the work of defending and confirming the gospel (vv. 7–8).

<span id="page-136-7"></span><span id="page-136-6"></span>1:8 Paul calls upon God to bear witness to the sincerity of his affection for the Philippians—which only God could know with certainty. Paul does not take credit for these affections, for they are the "affection of Christ." They come from him, not Paul. It is a wonderful thing for these two words—"affection" and "Christ"—to be linked together, as "affection" repeatedly refers in the NT to the compassion Jesus shows to others (Matt. 9:36; 14:14; 15:32). It is natural that Jesus would continue to provide the grace of affection to knit people together in the gospel.

<span id="page-136-9"></span><span id="page-136-0"></span>1:9–11 This three-verse prayer is one long, complicated sentence in Greek. It has a three-fold structure: (1) request, (2) purpose, and (3) final result.

<span id="page-136-8"></span><span id="page-136-3"></span>1:9 Paul *asks* that the Philippians' love would abound in knowledge and all discernment. It should come as no surprise that Paul's request would highlight love. Paul esteems love as greater than even faith and hope (1 Cor. 13:13). But here Paul prays for a certain kind of love: one that is discerning and knowing. Paul allows no either-or thinking in his prayers for the Philippians. He does not contemplate a future in which they excel in love *or* knowledge: love without knowledge is squishy and spineless sentimentalism; knowledge without love is meaningless (1 Cor. 13:2). Paul calls for both light (i.e., knowledge) and heat (i.e., love).

<span id="page-136-10"></span><span id="page-136-2"></span><span id="page-136-1"></span>1:10a The *purpose* of this love is to "approve what is excellent." The verb here means to "test and approve" (*dokimazō*). The closest parallel is Romans 12:2, where Paul calls for renewal of the mind so that "by testing you may discern [*dokimazō*] what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." A discerning type of love will enable the Philippians to set their highest affections on the highest virtues and not get distracted by devoting themselves to lesser, peripheral matters.

<span id="page-136-11"></span>1:10b–11 The *result* of a love rich in knowledge and discernment, firmly fixed on excellent things, is moral purity and completeness. "Pure" (*eilikrinēs*) has the sense of being morally unmixed, while "blameless" (*aproskopos*) focuses more on being faultless in respect to external actions. The combination of these two terms conveys

<span id="page-136-15"></span><span id="page-136-14"></span><span id="page-136-13"></span><span id="page-136-12"></span><sup>11</sup> The word is used only 26 times in the NT, 10 of which are in Philippians (1:7; 2:2 [2x], 5; 3:15 [2x], 19; 4:2, 10 [2x]). In Philippians it spells out a specific way of looking at life that is in step with the gospel, which has the power to define the way Paul thinks about the Philippians (1:7) and the way Christians should think about fellow believers (2:2, 5; 4:2) and about Paul himself (4:10). The gospel can even define opponents as "enemies of the cross" (3:18).

a sense of completeness, covering both internal ("pure") and external ("blameless") aspects of Christian holiness.12

<span id="page-137-1"></span><span id="page-137-0"></span>This purity is not a moral achievement but a divine gift. Christians will be pure and blameless only by being "filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ" (1:11; for this theme in the OT, see Ps. 1:3 and Jer. 17:8). "Fruit of righteousness" probably refers to fruit that flows from righteousness, identified as the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22–23. This moral fruitfulness flows from the righteousness from God found in Jesus Christ (Phil. 3:9).13 This verse thus portrays the Reformation truth that the faith that alone justifies does not remain alone.

### <span id="page-137-3"></span>*Response*

### THE BLESSING OF BELONGING TO CHRIST

We must not rush through these verses and miss the momentous truth of union with Christ. Let us be freshly awed by the unfathomable blessing of belonging to Christ fully and forever. The feast of Christ is a forever feast that satisfies far more than a few worldly crumbs ever could.

### THE GOD-CENTERED SECURITY OF OUR SALVATION

<span id="page-137-2"></span>Let us rejoice in the God-centered security of our salvation; it is his work from the first day to the last (Phil. 1:5–6). As Markus Bockmuehl points out, Christian assurance rests not in the Christian-ness of our Christianity but in "the God-ness of God."14 If the power to save does not come *from* us, then the paralyzing pressure to save ourselves need not *oppress* us. Assurance of salvation rests not in how strong our grip is on our Father's hand but in how strong his grip is on us.

### GLORIFY GOD

Christians exist to praise God as pointers to his glory. We live a holy and loving life not to point to the work we do but to point to the fruit God grows in us through Christ. People should see our good works and say, "What a great God!" not "What a good person!" God's name will be set apart as something to be valued above all else when others can see what he has done for and through his people.

<sup>12</sup> So also Harmon, *Philippians*, 102.

<sup>13</sup> Many commentators distinguish the two uses of "righteousness" in Philippians. They see the first righteousness as moral (believers' good behavior; 1:11) and the second as forensic (God's legal declaration; 3:9). See, e.g., Moisés Silva, *Philippians*, 51–52. Both views arrive at the same place theologically once it is understood that imputed righteousness produces the fruit of righteousness.

### PHILIPPIANS 1:12–26

**<sup>12</sup>** I want you to know, brothers,*<sup>1</sup>* that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, **<sup>13</sup>** so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard*<sup>2</sup>* and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. **14**And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word*<sup>3</sup>* without fear.

**<sup>15</sup>** Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. **16**The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. **17**The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. **<sup>18</sup>**What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.

Yes, and I will rejoice, **<sup>19</sup>** for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, **<sup>20</sup>** as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. **21**For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. **<sup>22</sup>** If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. **<sup>23</sup>** I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. **24**But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. **25**Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, **<sup>26</sup>** so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.

1Or *brothers and sisters*. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word *adelphoi* (translated "brothers") may refer either to *brothers* or to *brothers and sisters*; also verse 14 2Greek *in the whole praetorium* 3Some manuscripts add *of God*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-138-1"></span><span id="page-138-0"></span>The main point of this passage is Paul's passion for the spread of the gospel. Paul has resolutely set his sights on the progress of the gospel, refusing to focus on personal preferences, hardships, or petty relational rivalries. At a formal level, this passage serves as both an update on the present progress of the gospel and a forecast of its future progress. At the functional level, Paul's perspective serves as an example of Christlike humility that looks after the interests of others above one's own and rejoices in the Lord. Paul makes the choice to remain on earth for the progress of the Philippians (1:22–26), even though departing and being with Christ would be better by far (1:21). Paul's example foreshadows what he will ask the Philippians to do: "count others more significant than yourselves" and "do <span id="page-139-4"></span><span id="page-139-2"></span>nothing from selfish ambition" (2:3). Even though some have selfish ambition in preaching Christ (1:15), Paul is a model of rejoicing in the Lord (3:1) because he rejoices *only* that Christ is proclaimed (1:18).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-139-0"></span>1:12 One of the most surprising moments in the whole letter comes when Paul declares that his imprisonment has actually *advanced* the gospel instead of *hindering* it. Paul draws attention to this surprise in two ways: (1) a wordplay between "advance" and "hinder"15 and (2) acknowledgment that his circumstances have advanced the gospel, contrary to what one would normally expect.16

<span id="page-139-1"></span>1:13 Paul explains the first of two ways in which his imprisonment has advanced the gospel: the progress of the gospel among nonbelievers. The gospel has thus advanced because it has become crystal clear that Paul's imprisonment is literally "in Christ." Paul makes a profound point: he lives all of life "in Christ"—including his imprisonment. He appears to be in the custody of Caesar, but all the while he is under the ultimate control of Christ. Jesus has sent him there for the progress of the gospel. The fact that he closes the letter with a greeting from "Caesar's household" (4:22) testifies to the power of the gospel over the most powerful family in the world. Paul is in prison at the sovereign bidding of King Jesus so that the gospel would push past the defenses of a seemingly impenetrable group of people—the whole imperial guard (elite Roman soldiers under the direct command of Caesar).17

<span id="page-139-5"></span><sup>15</sup> The Greek word for "advance" is *prokopē*, while the word for "hinder" is *proskopē*. See G. Walter Hansen, *The Letter to the Philippians*, PNTC (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2009), 67.

<sup>16</sup> The Greek word *mallon* (here translated "really") can be taken as an intensive ("my circumstances have *definitely* advanced the gospel"), but I think a stronger case can be made for the contrastive sense ("my circumstances have advanced the gospel, *contrary to* what one would naturally expect").

<sup>17</sup> Harmon notes that the imperial guard numbered between 9,000 and 10,000 in Paul's day (Harmon, *Philippians*, 115).

<span id="page-140-2"></span>1:14 Paul now explains the second way in which his imprisonment has caused the gospel to advance: progress of the gospel among believers. Paul's imprisonment has led to an explosion of evangelistic boldness to speak the gospel without fear ("most of the brothers"; "much more bold"). Paul also clarifies the cause of this evangelistic increase: confidence in the Lord because of his imprisonment. This response is surprising once again. The natural, knee-jerk reaction to persecution would be to shrink back and speak less because of fear. Instead, the opposite happened: trust in the Lord grew as the brothers observed Paul's example of bold gospel witness in prison.

<span id="page-140-5"></span><span id="page-140-4"></span>1:15–17 Paul divides the people preaching Christ into two camps: those who preach Christ from false motives and those who preach from sheer delight (*eudokia*) 18 in Christ. The content of the preaching is the same, but the motives are different. Paul's heart is set on the advance of the gospel. Many preachers in Rome love Paul (v. 16) and share his delight in Christ and passion for the progress of the gospel. Others, however, seem more interested in the expansion of their own ministries or reputations. This latter group does not preach Christ "sincerely," but to accomplish two things: to benefit themselves ("selfish ambition"; v. 17; cf. 2:3), and to cause trouble for Paul. The contrast could not be greater between preaching to advance the interests of Christ and preaching to advance one's own interests.

<span id="page-140-8"></span><span id="page-140-6"></span>1:18ab The question "What then?" and the answer "Only that" signal that Paul has reached a conclusion on the matter of mixed motives in preaching. He has made a resolute choice to "rejoice" that "Christ is proclaimed" (v. 18). Paul's heart is bound up with the advance of the gospel, not his own interests. He is preoccupied with Christ's name, not his own. This is the third time Paul has mentioned preaching Christ in this short section (1:15, 17, 18).

<span id="page-140-7"></span><span id="page-140-3"></span>1:18c–19 Paul has chosen to rejoice in the present whenever the gospel advances through preaching. Now he chooses to rejoice even as he faces an unknown future ("Yes, and I will rejoice"). Paul's reason for rejoicing comes down to the certainty of his "deliverance." This term (*sōtēria*) could refer either to physical deliverance from prison or to spiritual deliverance in terms of salvation. Both are possible, but I prefer the translation of "salvation."19

Paul's suffering as a prisoner under the tyranny of unjust rulers is not a new reality for God's people. Paul is aware of the part he plays in a larger drama that has played out throughout the history of salvation. Therefore, I believe, he draws

<span id="page-140-9"></span><sup>18</sup> This word could mean "good will" (ESV) but often conveys the stronger sense of pleasure or delight (cf. Phil. 2:13). So also Harmon, *Philippians*, 123.

<span id="page-140-10"></span><span id="page-140-1"></span><span id="page-140-0"></span><sup>19</sup> Harmon gives four compelling reasons why "salvation" might be preferred to "deliverance." First, elsewhere in Paul the word *sōtēria* always refers to spiritual salvation. Second, the verb *sōzō* fits the same pattern because it also always means spiritual salvation in Paul. Paul's pattern is to use the term *rhuomai* to refer to physical deliverance (2 Cor. 1:10). Both *rhuomai* and *sōzō* occur in 2 Timothy 4:18, and the pattern holds there as well: the Lord will "rescue" (*rhuomai* ) him from every evil deed and bring him safely (*sōzō*) into his heavenly kingdom. Third, the rest of the context fits the perspective of end-time salvation. Fourth, Paul's use of Job 13:16 points to his focus on vindication before God (cf. Harmon, *Philippians*, 133–134).

<span id="page-141-5"></span><span id="page-141-1"></span><span id="page-141-0"></span>upon the language of Job to express his confidence in his final vindication before God. Job had confidently stated that if he were to appear before God, then God would rule in his favor and uphold his innocence (Job 13:1–28). Job says, "This will be my salvation" (v. 16), which in the Greek version (LXX) reads, *touto moi apobēsetai eis sōtērian*, the very words we find here in Philippians 1:19, which would then read as, "this will turn out for my salvation." Paul's joy is bound up with the salvation of his soul, not the outcome of his trial. He is not rejoicing in the possibility of getting out of jail; he is rejoicing in the certainty of his salvation in Christ. Paul's confidence that God will complete the good work of salvation begun in the Philippians (Phil. 1:6) is true concerning his own salvation as well. Paul's assurance of salvation will be made secure with the help of the prayers of the Philippians and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Paul's salvation is a unified work of the triune God: "The Father answers the prayers of His people for fresh experiences of the Spirit of His Son Jesus Christ."20

<span id="page-141-6"></span><span id="page-141-3"></span>1:20 Paul turns to the OT again in solidarity with the people of God through the ages. Here he draws upon two key terms from Psalm 34:3–5:21

- Oh, magnify [*megalynate* in the LXX] the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!
- I sought the Lord, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed [*kataischynthē* in the LXX].

Paul and David share the same heart cry and live out the same pattern. Paul's eager expectation and hope in this current situation is two-fold: (1) he will not be ashamed (*aischynthēsomai* ), but (2) Christ will be magnified (*megalynthēsetai* ). He is convinced that Christ will be magnified in his body no matter the outcome of his trial (life or death). If he lives, Christ will be made much of because he holds sovereign control of the hearts of the earthly Roman rulers. If he dies, Christ will be made much of through Paul's testimony that the steadfast love of the Lord is better than life (cf. Ps. 63:3).

<span id="page-141-7"></span><span id="page-141-4"></span>1:21 "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." The pithy and poetic power of this verse is clear in English translation, but it shines even more in Paul's original Greek because of the beauty of his skillful use of similar vowel (assonance) and consonant (consonance) sounds. The following underlined portions help the reader see the six similar sounds (*to*/*to*; *ēn*/*ein; os*/*os*):

 *to zēn Christos* ("to live is Christ") *to apothanein kerdos* ("to die is gain")

<sup>20</sup> Harmon, *Philippians*, 136.

<span id="page-141-2"></span><sup>21</sup> Gordon Fee also identifies Psalm 34 as an echo of Philippians; cf. his *Paul's Letter to the Philippians*, NICNT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1995), 136.

<span id="page-142-4"></span><span id="page-142-1"></span>Verse 23 will describe in more detail why "to die is gain," but what does "to live is Christ" mean? It means that Christ completely defines the meaning of life. Galatians 2:20 gives further help:

I have been crucified with *Christ*. It is no longer I who *live*, but *Christ* who *lives* in me. And the life I now *live* in the flesh I *live* by faith in *the Son of God*, who loved me and gave himself for me.

<span id="page-142-3"></span>1:22–24 These verses set up an important question: If Christ would be magnified both by life and by death, which option should Paul prefer? If Christ allowed Paul to live, it would mean further fruitful labor under the lordship of Christ. But if Christ chose death for Paul, he could depart and be with Christ. Death would bring greater gain because it would result in more of Christ. Therefore, all things being equal, Paul clearly expresses his preference for death as "far better." In fact, Paul piles on the comparatives to intensify the sense of how much better it would be to be with Christ. A woodenly literal translation of the phrase "far better" (v. 23) would be "much [*pollō*] more [*mallon*] better [*kreissōn*]." However, all things are not equal. When Paul factors in the needs of the Philippians, the scale is tilted toward remaining in the flesh because it is more necessary for their good.

<span id="page-142-5"></span><span id="page-142-2"></span>1:25 Because he is convinced the Philippians need him, Paul knows Christ will choose for him to "remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith." Paul continues to embrace his central concern in this section: the progress of the gospel. Paul began this section by highlighting the progress ( *prokopē*) of the gospel in Rome (1:12) and now he concludes it by referencing the progress ( *prokopē*) of the gospel among the Philippians (v. 25). It is also clear that faith cannot be reduced to mere intellectual assent, for Paul connects it to "joy" (lit., "the joy of faith"). Joy flows from faith. Saving faith savors Christ.

<span id="page-142-6"></span>1:26 Paul also prefers to continue on earth so that when the Philippians see him again they will have more reason to boast in Christ—if and when Paul returns to Philippi. A joyful reunion would give the Philippians more fuel for the fire of boasting in Christ. The specific object of boasting would be "Christ Jesus in me." The closest parallel to this thought comes in Galatians, where Paul says the Judean Christians "glorified God because of me" at the sight of his seemingly impossible conversion (Gal. 1:24).

### LET MY NAME PERISH

George Whitefield, the influential evangelist of the First Great Awakening, exemplified Paul's preoccupation with the name of Christ over his own name. Whitefield decided to hand the reigns of leadership of the Methodist movement over to John Wesley because the movement was in danger of being divided over allegiance to either Whitefield or Wesley. Whitefield's followers urged him to take back his posi<span id="page-143-0"></span>tion of leadership. They warned him that his name would be forgotten because of what he had done. He replied by declaring, "My name? Let the name of Whitefield perish if only the name of Christ be glorified."22 The singular passion of a faithful Christian minister is to make much of *the name of Christ*. John the Baptist was content to let his name and influence decrease; his joy was completely bound up with the increasing fame of Jesus (John 3:30).

**<sup>27</sup>**Only let your manner of life be worthy*<sup>1</sup>* of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, **<sup>28</sup>** and not frightened in anything by your opponents.

1Greek *Only behave as citizens worthy*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-143-2"></span>This passage both begins the body of the letter and contains its main point: believers are to "behave as citizens worthy of the gospel" (1:27 ESV mg.). The passage works both backward and forward. First, it works backward through the profound connection between 1:12–26 (Paul's update) and 1:27–30 (the update he wants to hear from *them*). Just as they have now heard that he is standing firm for the spread of the gospel despite his suffering, he now wants to hear from them that they too are standing firm in the gospel despite their suffering. God has brought good out of Paul's suffering, and Paul wants the Philippians to be confident that God will bring good out of their suffering as well. God has graciously given both the gift of faith and the gift of suffering. They should stand firm and strive forward in gospel faith, not shrink back in faithless fear. The opponents will be destroyed; the Philippians will be saved.

Second, this section looks forward. As noted in the Introduction, three terms that we find here appear again at the end of the body and thus have a bookend (inclusio) effect (table 2.3).

The rarity of these terms makes their reappearance later in the letter all the more striking.23 The parallels become even more impressive when examining additional repeated terms found in 1:27–2:4 and 3:15–4:3. Letter writers often place parallel words at the beginning and end of a section to mark it off as a literary unit. The parallels seen in table 2.4 show Paul's intentionality in binding this section together as a unit of thought.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-145-5"></span><span id="page-145-4"></span>1:27a The main point of the passage comes in the form of this opening command: "behave as citizens worthy of the gospel" (1:27 ESV mg.). This verse is the thesis statement of the entire letter; it is the first imperative of the letter, and all subsequent imperatives serve to flesh out what it means to behave as citizens worthy of the gospel. The adverb "only" adds a note of sharp singularity so that the command is even more of a focal point.

<span id="page-145-9"></span><span id="page-145-1"></span><span id="page-145-0"></span>The phrase "worthy of the gospel" requires some explanation. "Worthy" signifies something that fits with the weight and worth of its standard of reference. Paul elsewhere speaks of living worthy of the Christian "calling" (Eph. 4:1), of "the Lord" (Col. 1:10), or of "God" (1 Thess. 2:12). In this passage, the standard of reference or measuring rod is the gospel. In this sense, the closest parallel is Galatians 2:14 and its reference to "conduct" that is or is not "in step with the truth of the gospel." The gospel is the "gold standard" for the Christian life, and as such its worth and weight govern the Christian life. The gospel becomes the shared story that unites all Christians and provides a reference point for all of their thinking and living. D. A. Carson says it well: "Conduct worthy of the gospel is above all conduct that promotes the gospel."24

<span id="page-145-7"></span>1:27b–28 Paul follows the command of verse 27a with a purpose clause signified in the ESV by "so that" (*hina*). The previous command serves as a defining purpose for any situation in which the Philippian believers find themselves. Regardless of whether Paul comes to see them or remains absent, this command to behave as worthy citizens will not change. It expresses Paul's desire to see the Philippians "standing firm in one spirit." Gordon Fee has made a compelling case for taking "spirit" here as a reference to the "Holy Spirit."25 The Philippians are to stand firm in the same sphere: the Holy Spirit. Ephesians 4:1–3 is a close parallel, as Paul calls the Ephesians to live in a manner worthy of their calling as Christians by being eager to maintain the oneness produced by the Spirit (cf. "one Spirit"; Eph. 4:4).

<span id="page-145-8"></span><span id="page-145-6"></span><span id="page-145-3"></span><span id="page-145-2"></span>Paul uses two participles to provide further details on how to and how not to stand firm in the Holy Spirit: (1) by striving together side by side (Phil. 1:27b) and (2) by *not* fearing the opponents, since the Philippians will be saved and their opponents destroyed (v. 28). The first participle highlights a single-minded striving for the faith of the gospel. The "one mind" here is a reference to the gospel as the sole point of reference, providing unity. The imagery of striving side by side calls to mind Roman soldiers marching forward in lock-step for the advancement of the empire. The Philippians are citizens of heaven, standing firm in the spread of the gospel. The only other place in the NT where the rare verb "strive side by

<sup>24</sup> Carson, *Basics for Believers*, 55.

<sup>25</sup> Fee, *Philippians*, 163–166.

<span id="page-146-7"></span>side" occurs is Philippians 4:3, where Paul's coworkers have labored side by side in the gospel. They are striving for the progress of the gospel, expressed as faith originating with or produced by the gospel. As the word of Christ in the gospel is proclaimed and heard, faith comes from that hearing (Rom. 10:17)

<span id="page-146-4"></span><span id="page-146-3"></span>The second participle is "not frightened" (Phil. 1:28). The Philippians should not be frightened by the persecution of those who oppose them. The fearless response of the Philippians should send a clear signal to their opponents: God will save the Philippians but destroy any who oppose them. The phrase "and that from God" most likely refers to both the destruction of their opponents and the salvation of the Philippians, with the emphasis on salvation.26

<span id="page-146-0"></span>The note Paul sounds here has rich biblical background. God promised Abraham he would curse whoever cursed Abraham (Gen. 12:3). Furthermore, God promised his old covenant people he would fight for them, that their adversaries would become his adversaries. Note especially the conceptual connections between Exodus 14:13 and Philippians 1:27–28 (cf. LXX):

<span id="page-146-1"></span>"Moses said to the people, 'Fear not [*tharseō*], stand firm [*histēmi*], and see the salvation [*sōtēria*] of the Lord [*para tou theou*], which he will work for you today.'" (Ex. 14:13)

". . . standing firm [*stēkō*] in one spirit . . . and not frightened [*ptyrō*] in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation [*sōtēria*], and that from God [*apo theou*]." (Phil. 1:27–28)

<span id="page-146-2"></span>These two passages share two exact verbal connections ("salvation" and "God") and at least four conceptual connections (standing firm, not fearing, salvation from God, and destruction of enemies). Paul's language for the enemies of the Philippians could also come from Exodus 23:22 (LXX) because of the shared term "adversary" (*antikeimai* ): "if you carefully obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary [*antikeimai* ] to your adversaries [*antikeimai* ]" (Ex. 23:22).

If Paul intends a connection between Exodus 14 and Philippians 1, then the message is clear: God will save his new covenant people and fight for them so that their adversaries will be his adversaries and will be destroyed. The comparison actually reveals a reversal. The old covenant people of God were saved from death but were later destroyed for their unbelief and disobedience in the wilderness. The new covenant people of God experience salvation on the other side of death and remain faithful in the face of persecution as those faithful unto death. They are not afraid of their persecutors because at death they will depart and be with Christ, while Christ will fully destroy their opponents (cf. Phil. 3:19).

<span id="page-146-6"></span><span id="page-146-5"></span>1:29–30 Paul now gives the whole thesis a God-centered ground ("for" [*hoti* ]). Paul unpacks the "from God" reference in verse 28, which in turn goes back to every-

<sup>26</sup> Ibid., 170. Some say the antecedent of the pronoun *touto* is only salvation, not destruction *and* salvation. See O'Brien, *Philippians*, 157.

<span id="page-147-2"></span><span id="page-147-0"></span>thing covered in 1:27–28. God has graciously given two gifts to the Philippians: faith and persecution. Faith is an exceedingly precious gift of God that enables us to receive the free gift of salvation. In other words, faith is the free gift that receives the free gift of salvation! The closest parallel is Ephesians 2:8–9: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this27 is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

<span id="page-147-3"></span>Persecution is also a gracious gift of God. The pleasure of God in persecution is a startling concept, but a biblical one. Verse 30 shows that God has written a story of persecution for his people. The Philippian church was born in the throes of persecution, and now the story of persecution is shared by Paul and the Philippians.

### *Response*

#### FAITH AND PERSECUTION ARE OFTEN A PACKAGE GIFT

Faith and persecution are often a package gift; when the flame of faith shines in a dark place, the darkness will try to douse that faith and snuff it out. God writes a persecution story for his church so that mankind will be pointed back to the greatest story: the death and resurrection of Christ. Persecution is a parable that puts the death and resurrection of Christ on display again and again. Persecutors try to kill the faith of believers like they tried to kill Jesus, but faith rises just like Jesus did. When persecutors try everything in their power to kill faith, but faith refuses to die, resurrection power is on display. Opponents should fear, because they are actually fighting God, and they will lose. God's power preserves our faith. He who began the good work in us will bring it to completion at the day of Christ (Phil. 1:6), and nothing in all creation will be able to separate believers from his almighty grip of grace.

<span id="page-147-4"></span>These four verses are one long sentence in Greek. The sentence has an "if" (2:1)/"then" (v. 2ab) structure, followed by a series of attitudes and actions showing

<span id="page-148-4"></span><span id="page-148-3"></span>how to live out the main idea (vv. 2c–4), which is that, for Paul to experience fullness of joy, the Christians of Philippi must be unified (2:2ab).

<span id="page-148-6"></span><span id="page-148-0"></span>This passage is linked to three sections of Philippians: (1) the previous verses (1:12–30), (2) the following verses (2:5–11), and (3) the final verses of the body (4:2–3). First, these verses fit with the previous verses because they demonstrate that Paul practiced what he is preaching, as he seeks the interests of others above his own. Second, these verses describe the Christian mind, while the verses that follow describe the mind of Christ (2:5–11). Christ preeminently lived out these principles. Third, this same command appears again as the climactic command at the close of the book's body, where Paul calls Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord (4:2). We could bring out the similarity by translating as follows:

<span id="page-148-5"></span><span id="page-148-2"></span>Complete my joy so that you may think the same thing [*to auto phronēte*]. (2:2)

I urge Euodia and Syntyche to think the same thing [*to auto phronein*] in the Lord. (4:2)

- b. The Call for a Shared Gospel Thinking (2:2ab)
- c. Specific Gospel Dos and Don'ts (2:2c–4)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-148-1"></span>As just noted, these four verses are one sentence in the original language. The structure is an "if" (v. 1)/"then" (v. 2ab) construction followed by a series of participles spelling out how to carry out the command (vv. 2c–4).

2:1 The "if" clause contains five blessings the Philippians already share in common through the gospel of Christ. The point is a cumulative one. The way Paul formulates each phrase forces the Philippians to answer a similar question five times. Perhaps this can best be seen as a conversation:

| Paul: "Is there any encouragement in Christ?"     | The Philippians: "Yes." |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Paul: "Is there any comfort from love?"           | The Philippians: "Yes." |
| Paul: "Is there any participation in the Spirit?" | The Philippians: "Yes." |
| Paul: "Is there any affection?"                   | The Philippians: "Yes." |
| Paul: "Is there any sympathy?"                    | The Philippians: "Yes." |

Why would anyone communicate this way? One builds a case to lead to an inevitable conclusion. I say to my child, "Did I buy your clothes?" Child: "Yes." "Did I wash your clothes?" Child: "Yes." "Did I dry your clothes?" Child: "Yes." "Then it should not be too much to ask for you to fold your clothes!" Paul communicates in a similar way in order to build a case leading to a conclusion in verse 2.

<span id="page-149-0"></span>2:2ab The five-fold "yes" of shared gospel blessings should lead to the singular "yes" of a shared mind-set. The way Paul formulates the command is striking. Obeying the command is an invitation to fill up Paul's joy in them: if all those things are true, then "complete my joy by being of the same mind."

<span id="page-149-1"></span>2:2c–4 The rest of verses 2–4 feature six different ways a Christian mind should be expressed: (1) having the same love, (2) being in full accord, (3) being of one mind, (4) doing nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, (5) counting others more significant than yourselves, and (6) looking not only to one's own interests but also to the interests of others.

### *Response*

### HOW ONE BECOMES HUMBLE

Paul calls for humility to live out the Christian life. But how does one become humble? Someone asked the great preacher Martyn Lloyd-Jones this very question. His answer:

A friend was asking me the other day, "How can I be humble?" He felt there was pride in him, and he wanted to know how to get rid of it. He seemed to think that I had some patent remedy and could tell him, "Do this, that, and the other and you will be humble." I said, "I have no method or technique. I can't tell you to get down on your knees and believe in prayer because I know you will soon be proud of that. There's only one way to be humble, and that is to look into the face of Jesus Christ; you cannot be anything else when you see him." That is the only way. Humility is not something you can create within yourself; rather, you look at him, you realize who he is and what he has done, and you are humbled.28

That is exactly what Paul does next. He says, "Look at Jesus, realize who he is and what he has done, and you will be humbled."

### *Section Overview*

These seven verses are one long sentence in Greek. We will focus on three things. First, the main point of the passage is the call to have the mind of Christ, which is the pattern for the Christian mind of the previous passage. As shown in table 2.5, verse 5 contains the word that builds the verbal bridge connecting the ethical exhortation of 2:1–4 to the Christ hymn of 2:6–11.

This verbal painting beautifully captures the glories of the incarnation, life, death, ascension, and second coming of Jesus. Jesus was perfectly free of selfish ambition and empty conceit and perfectly full of humility and love. He could have used his exalted position of privilege for his own advantage (v. 6), but instead he humbled himself in a process that began with his taking on flesh in the form of a servant (v. 7) and climaxed with his death on a cross (v. 8). This voluntary humiliation led to the highest exaltation. God highly exalted him and gave him the name above every name (v. 9), so that everyone will bow before him (v. 10) and confess that he is Lord (v. 11).

<span id="page-151-16"></span><span id="page-151-6"></span><span id="page-151-1"></span>Second, the Christ hymn29 draws upon two texts from Isaiah (Isa. 45:14–25; 52:13–53:12). Paul skillfully sews these texts together to create a rich tapestry combining Isaiah's fourth Servant Song (Isa. 52:13–53:12) with the promise that every knee will bow (Isa. 45:23 is quoted in Phil. 2:10–11). The Christ hymn and the fourth Servant Song share much in common. First, both passages have a poetic or lyrical quality. It is no accident that many label them as a song (Servant Song) or hymn (Christ hymn). Second, the songs share the same movement and message. Specifically, the most striking similarity is the unique progression of thought from exaltation to humiliation and then back to exaltation. Third, while there are only a few shared words in the two texts ("death," "servant," "exalt"),30 clear conceptual connections abound.31 Fourth, the fact that Paul clearly cites Isaiah 45:23 in Philippians 2:10 shows that Paul has the wider context of Isaiah in view.

These four arguments have a cumulative force when the two passages are read together. Table 2.6 makes some of these connections clear.

Jesus had the very "form of God" (*morphē theou*; Phil. 2:6) and enjoys "equality with God" (*isa theō*; v. 6). He has the divine name (v. 11) and receives worship as God (vv. 10–11).

<sup>29</sup> Referring to the passage as a "Christ hymn" does not mean one should presume it was a pre-Pauline hymn used in the worship of the early church. Gordon Fee has argued it could merely be an example of Paul's exalted prose (Fee, *Philippians*, 40–43). This is an interesting discussion but does not have a direct bearing on how to read the passage in its present context.

<sup>30</sup> The explicit lexical connections are not as impressive as the conceptual links. Still, both passages use the same term for "death" (*thanotos*; Phil. 2:8; Isa. 53:12 LXX). Both have a cognate form of "exalt": Isaiah 52:13 uses *hypsoō*, while Philippians uses *hyperypsoō*. Isaiah 52:13–14 uses the word *pais* as a reference to the servant, while Philippians uses *doulos*. This difference is offset by the fact that Isaiah 49:3–7 uses *doulos* and Isaiah 53:11 uses the verb form *douleuō*.

<sup>31</sup> Both passages celebrate the central character's (1) humanity, (2) obedience, (3) humility, (4) death, and (5) exaltation/vindication.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-152-2"></span>2:5 Paul commands the Philippians to have the mind of Christ. He stresses the corporate and communal nature of this command, as they are to have this mind "among" them.32 To *have* the mind of Christ requires *knowing* the mind of Christ. How could anyone look into the mind of Christ? Through the miracle of inspiration, the next three verses usher us into the inner workings of Christ's mind. We get an inside look at the mind-set that put in motion his journey from the high point of heavenly majesty to the low point of earthly humiliation and the cross.

<span id="page-152-3"></span>2:6 This verse puts the emphasis on what the Son of God did not do, while verses 7–8 will focus on what he did do. He did not count equality with God as something to be used for his own advantage.33 Paul stresses the thinking (he did not "count") that prevented the exploiting (using his status of equality with God for his own advantage). Paul uses a participle ("being in the form of God") to tell the reader something spectacular about the identity34 and thinking of Jesus (the main verb, "count"). The ESV translates the participle with a concessive force, with the idea that "even though he was in the form of God, he did not count equality with God as something to selfishly exploit." This translation focuses on the contrast—even though he was God, he did not think it appropriate to exploit this status.35 A causal translation is also possible: "because of who he was, he did not think it appropriate to exploit his status as equal with God."

The relationship between the phrase "form of God" and Jesus' thinking becomes even more stunning when Paul turns in verses 7–8 to tell us what Jesus *did* do.

<span id="page-152-5"></span><span id="page-152-4"></span>2:7–8 If Jesus did not exploit his status as equal with God, then what did he do? (1) He emptied himself by taking the form of a slave (v. 7). (2) He humbled himself by becoming obedient even to the point of death on a cross (v. 8).

<span id="page-152-6"></span>"Emptied" (*kenoō*) here does not mean the Son of God emptied himself of his deity in some kind of theological subtraction. "Emptied" means "divestiture of

<span id="page-152-1"></span><sup>32</sup> *En hymin* could be translated "in yourselves" instead of "among yourselves." Both options are theologically true, but the second is more contextually accurate given the community focus of 2:1–4.

<sup>33</sup> I agree with most commentators in taking the Greek word *harpagmos* as "something to be selfishly exploited." The Son of God could have regarded his status of equality with God "as something to use for his own advantage," but he did not. See O'Brien, *Philippians*, 214–216; Harmon, *Philippians*, 209.

<sup>34</sup> "Form" (*morphē*) occurs only two times (Phil. 2:6, 7) in the entire NT. A "form" is the visible expression of the essential nature of something. Therefore, Paul says Christ is the visible expression (*morphē*) of God's (*theou*) very essence. The NT celebrates this truth frequently (John 1:1–18; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:1–3).

<span id="page-152-0"></span><sup>35</sup> The phrase "equality with God" (*isa theō*) celebrates the staggering truth that the preincarnate Son of God was completely God in every way. Harmon adds the important observation that "Paul says *to einai isa theō* (the state of being equal to God), not *to genesthai isa theō* (the act of becoming equal to God)" (Harmon, *Philippians*, 208n21).

position or prestige."36 How did the Son of God divest himself of position and prestige? Through the incarnation. Paul uses two clauses37 to explain more precisely the emptying. He "emptied himself": (1) by taking the form (*morphē*) of a servant and (2) by being born in the likeness of men. These two phrases are mutually interpreting. The only way for the Son of God to take on the form of a slave was to enter this world and be born as a man. Therefore, the preincarnate Son of God divested himself of position and prestige not by subtracting deity but by adding humanity and becoming the God-man, both fully God and fully man.38

<span id="page-153-3"></span>Verse 8 repeats the last thought of verse 7 in order to build upon it. Most languages use this style of speaking to build suspense and continue the story. If I were telling a story, I may let it build to a climax as follows:

"I heard a noise outside, and so I stepped out to see what it was. *And after going outside*, I saw a . . ."

Paul tells the shocking story of the descent of the Son of God in the same way, as the story descends to its lowest point: "[The Son of God] emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, [and by] being born in the likeness of men. *And being found in human form*, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."

<span id="page-153-2"></span>The verb "humbled" (*tapeinoō*) is striking because it was frequently used in reference to slaves and their loss of "prestige or status."39 Jesus is the model of the low-minded humility that Paul had called for in Philippians 2:3. A proud person would protest that some low position was "beneath" him or her. Jesus displayed his humility by not regarding anything as beneath him.

The next phrase shows the radical measure of Christ's humility. He did not even regard himself above death, even the cruelest, most shameful and painful death ever devised: crucifixion. The cross was deemed an especially appropriate death for rebels and slaves because it was designed not just to kill but also to shame.40 The victim was stripped down to no (or few) clothes and typically nailed to the cross through the ankles and wrists (or, sometimes, fastened with ropes). Death would come by suffocation, when the victim could no longer lift himself to draw breath. This excruciating pain and shame was common to all who were crucified, but Jesus' suffering on the cross is unparalleled and unequalled because he bore the terrible curse of sin (Gal. 3:13) and suffered the awful wrath of God as an atoning substitute and sacrifice (Rom. 3:21–26).

<span id="page-153-1"></span><span id="page-153-0"></span>The cross is the measure of Jesus' humility, the lengths to which he was willing to go in obedience to his Father. Even the lowest position possible was not too low

for the humble mind of Christ. Only the greatest humility (the lowest mind-set) could willingly accept the lowest place possible. He was not too proud to wear our skin or bear our sin.41

<span id="page-154-5"></span>2:9 "Therefore" (*dio kai* ) signals that these verses serve as God's response to the mind of Christ (God is the subject of the two verbs in this verse). Because the Son made himself so low in obeying the Father, it was perfectly fitting for the Father to exalt him so high. The first response was that God "highly exalted" (*hyperypsoō*) Jesus. The second response was that God "bestowed" (*charizō*) on him the name above every name. The "above-every-name Name" is the very name of Yahweh, or "Lord."

<span id="page-154-6"></span>2:10–11 These verses reveal two purposes God had in giving Jesus the divine name: (1) every knee will bow, and (2) every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Both of these purposes are drawn directly from Isaiah 45:23:

<span id="page-154-1"></span> By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: "To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance."

<span id="page-154-0"></span>Paul takes something from the OT that can be true only of Yahweh and breathtakingly applies it directly to Jesus. The context of Isaiah 45:23 makes this transfer all the more stunning because it emphatically declares that there is no other god besides the one true God. The Philippians passage answers a crucial question raised by Isaiah 45:22–23: all the ends of the earth are called to turn to God and be saved, but the rest of the passage does not specify how that salvation would happen. That information does not come until Isaiah 52:13–53:12. God's suffering servant will suffer for the sins of the people (Isa. 53:3–11) and will be exalted (52:13; 53:12). This prophecy finds its fulfillment in the suffering and exaltation of Jesus as every knee bows and every tongue confesses that he is Lord.

<span id="page-154-4"></span><span id="page-154-3"></span>Paul expansively names all of the spheres that will acknowledge the universal reign of Jesus: heaven, earth, and under the earth. All will bow. No sphere is exempt. The realm of God and the angels (heaven), the realm of humanity (earth), and the realm of the underworld with the demons and the Devil (under the earth)—all will bow. Some willingly bow now by joyful choice; some will be forced to bow in defeat, openly acknowledging the rightful rule of the exalted Christ on the day when he returns.

<span id="page-154-7"></span><span id="page-154-2"></span>Verse 11 continues to draw upon Isaiah 45 as Paul shows how this universal confession of Jesus as Lord fits with God's ultimate goal of glorifying his name. The Greek text of Isaiah 45:24 says that righteousness and glory shall come to Yahweh. God the Father is the one who highly exalted Jesus and bestowed on

him the divine name of Lord, and so now the universal confession of Jesus as Lord draws attention to "the glory of God the Father."

### *Response*

THE LOWEST PLACE REVEALS THE GREATEST LOVE

The Roman orator Cicero once said, "Let the very name of the cross be far away not only from the body of a Roman citizen, but even from his thoughts, his eyes, his ears."42 This shows the upside-down nature of God's kingdom. The cross was far from the thoughts of Rome's citizens but near to the thoughts of heaven's citizens. Meditate much on the cross. Behold how the lowest point of Christ's descent displayed the highest peak of his love. Jesus went from the highest place of heavenly blessing to the lowest place of earthly curse—death on a cross. Why did he have to go so low? He had to come to where we were in order to rescue us. If someone falls into a pit, it does no good to meet him half way. Our rescue from sin and death required Jesus to go all the way down to where we were, enslaved in complete condemnation. The Son of God left the courts of heaven and laid aside his crown to bear the dreadful curse on the cross. The hymn "What Wondrous Love Is This" captures the depth of our despair and testifies that Christ's love went deeper still:

 When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down, When I was sinking down, sinking down; When I was sinking down beneath God's righteous frown, Christ laid aside his crown for my soul, for my soul, Christ laid aside his crown for my soul.

<span id="page-155-3"></span>Stand in awe of the self-giving love of God seen in the cross of Christ. Rejoice in the Jesus "who loved me and gave himself for me" (Gal. 2:20).

### THE MIND OF CHRIST PERFECTLY REFLECTS THE CHARACTER OF GOD

<span id="page-155-1"></span>God is a giver, not a grasper. Generosity is a defining aspect of the God-ness of God. The contrast between the blessed God and fallen humans is great on this score. Fallen human rulers are selfish graspers and hoarders. By contrast, God gloriously needs nothing, because he is perfect and has no deficits. God is not "served by human hands, as though he needed anything" (Acts 17:25a). The God who has no needs delights to meet the needs of the needy: "He himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything" (Acts 17:25b). He does not need workers who wait upon him hand and foot; he works for those who wait for him (Isa. 64:4).

<span id="page-155-2"></span><span id="page-155-0"></span>The incarnation put the nature of God as giver on display in a preeminent way. Precisely because Jesus was God (a preeminent giver), he took a form that fit with

<sup>42</sup> Cicero, *Pro Rabiro Perduellionis Reo* 5.10.16, cited in Hawthorne and Martin, *Philippians*, 123.

the nature of God as giver: a "slave" (*doulos*). Giving and serving defines the very vocation of a slave. A slave serves perpetually, not occasionally.

### IF GOD HAS BEEN HUMBLE, HOW CAN WE BE PROUD?

One cannot be a follower of Christ without sharing the mind of Christ. This command to have his mind calls for real relationships, because we must know the interests of others before we can seek them. Once we know those interests, we can use whatever power and privilege we have to serve others. Hoarding is not the path of joy. We will find it more blessed to give than to receive. We must cultivate gospel humility. Pride is high-minded and believes that some things are beneath us. We must behold the one who was high above all and yet did not regard anything as beneath him in saving us. If Christ took off the royal robes and put on the servant's towel to die for us, how can we say that any call to serve others for his sake is beneath us?

### PHILIPPIANS 2:12–18

**<sup>12</sup>**Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, **<sup>13</sup>** for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.

**<sup>14</sup>**Do all things without grumbling or disputing, **<sup>15</sup>** that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, **16**holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. **17**Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. **18**Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.

### *Section Overview*

These verses build upon the foundation ("Therefore") established in the example of the mind of Christ in the previous passage. The Philippians have received Christ Jesus as Lord by faith. They have bowed the knee and confessed with the tongue. Now what? Paul presents the new covenant church as the reverse or inversion of old covenant Israel as his exhortation sets up a contrast between the disobedience of the Israelites and the obedience of the Philippians.43 Table 2.7 highlights this contrast or reversal.

<span id="page-156-0"></span><sup>43</sup> The phrase "not only . . . in my presence but much more in my absence" also connects this part of Philippians with the thesis section of the letter, where Paul says, "whether I come and see you or am absent" (1:27). The exodus typology that marked the earlier passage (1:27–28) now reappears.

Moses declared they were not God's children, and their track record of disobedience increased further after his death.

By contrast, the Philippians have a track record of obedience that has only increased in Paul's absence. Paul calls them now to work out their own salvation because they know God is sovereignly working his good pleasure in their lives. This good pleasure should not sound like grumbling or disputing. The Philippians are children of God that shine bright like stars against the backdrop of the dark and perverse generation in which they live. Paul is a model of not grumbling about or disputing over what God sovereignly works for his good pleasure. Paul rejoices to be poured out as a drink offering upon the Philippians' faith (2:17), and he calls them to rejoice as well.

The OT continues to serve as a script for Paul and the Philippians. There are several other OT allusions and echoes in this passage, as table 2.8 shows.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-158-2"></span>2:12 Paul sets up a contrast right from the start between the old covenant and the new. Unlike the old covenant people of God, who disobeyed even more in Moses' absence than in his presence (Deut. 31:27), the Philippians are the new covenant people of God who will obey more in Paul's absence than in his presence (Phil. 2:12). Paul characterizes obedience as a call to "work out your own salvation." The word "your" (*heautōn*) is plural in the passage, showing again Paul's stress on the communal aspect of the body (cf. vv. 1–4).

<span id="page-158-6"></span><span id="page-158-5"></span><span id="page-158-1"></span><span id="page-158-0"></span>In the original Greek, "with fear and trembling" is at the front of the final clause for emphasis. Believers cannot have a cavalier attitude toward obedience. Their final salvation has a present outworking among the believing community. "Fear and trembling" (*tromos kai phobos*; Ex. 15:16 LXX) accompanied "salvation" (*sōtēria*; Ex. 14:13; 15:2) at the exodus, but there is one key difference: the "fear and trembling" at the exodus was external to Israel; it gripped the peoples surrounding them (Ex. 15:16). God's new covenant salvation is greater because God works fear and trembling within his people ("in you"; Phil. 2:13) because of their "salvation" (*sōtēria*) in Christ. The next verse will further this discussion of "fear" as that which God works within us in the new covenant.

<span id="page-158-7"></span>2:13 The call to "work out" our salvation (v. 12) must be informed by the fact that God "works in" (v. 13). Christians work out that which God has already worked in us. The conjunction "for" helps make this logic between the two verses crystal clear: it is true that we work and that God works, but we work (v. 12) *because* (*gar*) God works (v. 13).

This understanding of the decisive part God plays helps make further sense of the phrase "fear and trembling" in the previous verse. Paul's preaching among the Corinthians was in "fear and trembling," not because he had stage fright but because he knew his work of preaching was totally dependent upon God's power (cf. 1 Cor. 2:3). In the same way, Christian obedience is a dependent work carried out with fear and trembling because God's work is the decisive factor in our obedience. Our work is derivative of and dependent upon his work.

<span id="page-158-4"></span>Specifically, God's work accomplishes our willing and working ("both to will and to work"). God provides the desire (i.e., the will) for obedience and the power (i.e., the work) for that same obedience. Paul also wants the reader to know that God takes great delight in the work he does in the lives of his children. God is at work "for his good pleasure" (*hyper tēs eudokias*).

<span id="page-158-3"></span>The new covenant promises are present as the implicit backdrop for this whole discussion. The closest parallel is Jeremiah 32:40–41 (LXX 39:40–41):

I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the *fear* of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me. I will *rejoice* in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.

<span id="page-159-6"></span>The similarities are important: (1) the Jeremiah text (LXX) has the same term for "fear" ( *phobos*) found in Philippians 2:12; (2) Jeremiah has the same stress on God's pleasure or joy ("I will rejoice") in doing this internal work in the lives of his new covenant people.

<span id="page-159-10"></span><span id="page-159-8"></span>2:14–16 In the original language, these verses are one sentence, consisting of a command (v. 14) and a purpose (vv. 15–16a) followed by a final result (v. 16b). The command of verse 14 lacks any conjunction (a technique known as *asyndeton*) spelling out its precise connection to the previous command. Most people take this command not to grumble or dispute as an immediate application of the command to work out our own salvation (v. 12). It is a strikingly complete prohibition against grumbling and disputing ("*do all things*" without grumbling or disputing).

<span id="page-159-1"></span>Some people minimize what is at stake in this verse because they fail to appreciate the OT backdrop. The word here for "grumbling" (*gongysmos*) appears eight times in the Greek translation of the OT (the LXX), and seven of these eight occurrences refer to the grumbling of Israel in the wilderness.44 Even more grave is the link between Israel's grumbling and God's judgment (Num. 11:1; 14:27, 29), which is the story Paul recounts in 1 Corinthians 10:10 when he warns believers not to grumble like Israel did, for they were "destroyed by the Destroyer."

<span id="page-159-7"></span><span id="page-159-3"></span><span id="page-159-2"></span>Philippians 2:15–16 is a purpose clause connected to the command of verse 14. Paul referenced Deuteronomy 31:27 in Philippians 2:12, and now he takes the reader to Deuteronomy 32:5 in Philippians 2:15–16. Paul intentionally inverts the Deuteronomy passage by identifying the Philippians as the children of God, whereas Moses had said the old covenant people were *not* God's children. The Philippians live *in the midst of* a crooked and twisted generation; the Israelites *were* the crooked and twisted generation. As seen in table 2.9, inversion of identity is clear when we put the passages side by side.

<span id="page-159-9"></span><span id="page-159-5"></span><span id="page-159-4"></span>Paul then draws upon Daniel 12 to spell out the Philippians' identity as "lights in the world" (Phil. 2:15). The allusion is a strong one, as Daniel 12:3 and Philippians

<span id="page-159-0"></span><sup>44</sup> Exodus 16:7, 8 [2x], 9, 12; Numbers 17:20, 25 [English 17:5, 10]). The only exception is Isaiah 58:9.

<span id="page-160-6"></span><span id="page-160-3"></span><span id="page-160-2"></span>2:15 are the only places in the Bible containing the idea of God's people "shining" as "stars" or "lights." Daniel 12 declares what will happen in the latter days (Dan. 12:1): the dead will be raised. Some will enjoy everlasting life, while others will suffer everlasting contempt (v. 2). Therefore, those who shine like stars in Daniel 12:3 are those whose names are in the book of life (v. 1) and who are raised to enjoy everlasting life (v. 2).

<span id="page-160-4"></span>Paul's already/not yet theology draws upon Daniel 12 and highlights the fact that believers are *already* raised to the heavenly places in Christ Jesus even though the final bodily resurrection has *not yet* happened. They really do shine like stars in the sky because they are spiritually raised already with Christ in the heavens. The Philippians live in a dark world—a crooked and twisted generation—but they shine like stars against the backdrop of a dark night sky.

<span id="page-160-7"></span>Paul instructs the Philippians to shine like stars amid a dark world *by means of* "holding fast to the word of life" (Phil. 2:16). The "word of life" is probably a reference to the gospel.45 This whole phrase is a participle of means and reinforces the importance of Paul's call to obedience and to working out their own salvation.46 This phrase probably also comes from Daniel 12:3. The Greek text of Daniel 12:3 says those who shine are "those who hold strong to my words." The parallel between "hold strong to my words" (Dan. 12:3) and "holding fast to the word of life" (Phil. 2:16) is probably strong enough to suggest an echo.47

<span id="page-160-5"></span>The last part of verse 16 is the overarching result that will take place if the Philippians hold fast to the word of life: "In the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain." Paul's pride here is not sinful boasting but appropriate joy in what God has accomplished through him. He keeps his sights set on "the day of Christ" (1:6, 10; 2:16). On that day, Paul will rest, knowing his labor was not in vain. Here he draws upon the language of God's servant in Isaiah, who, like Paul, has a calling to be a light to the nations and to bring salvation to the ends of the earth (Isa. 49:5–6), but who worries that "I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity" (Isa. 49:4).

<span id="page-160-9"></span><span id="page-160-1"></span><span id="page-160-0"></span>2:17–18 Paul's perspective on ministry is a model of not grumbling. Even if he were to be "poured out" in death "as a drink offering" upon the "sacrificial service" (ESV "sacrificial offering") of the Philippians' faith, he would not grumble but rejoice. Paul stresses joy so much that he saturates these two verses with four references to rejoicing (using "rejoice" or "be glad" [*chairō*] and "rejoice with" [*synchairō*]). The only difference between the two verses is that in verse 17 Paul presents the rejoicing as that which is already the case (he rejoices, and rejoices with them), while in verse 18 he presents the rejoicing as something that should be true (you should "be glad" and "rejoice with me").

<span id="page-160-8"></span><sup>45</sup> O'Brien, *Philippians*, 296.

<sup>46</sup> The phrase could also be rendered "holding out the word of life," stressing evangelism.

<sup>47</sup> The echo is not certain, because the verbs are not the same. The LXX of Daniel 12:3 reads *katischyō* ("hold strong"), while Paul uses *epechō* ("hold fast").

### *Response*

WE WORK BECAUSE GOD WORKS

I love the way John Murray spells out the significance of the command to work out our salvation:

God's working in us is not suspended because we work, nor our working suspended because God works. Neither is the relation strictly one of cooperation as if God did his part and we did ours so that the conjunction or coordination of both produced the required result. God works in us and we also work. But the relation is that because God works we work.48

<span id="page-161-1"></span>Therefore, the dual working of God and man is a matter not of cancelation or cooperation but of foreordination. In the same way that we love because he first loved us, we work because he first worked in us. Ephesians 2:10 says that we are God's workmanship, and we walk in the good works he foreordained for us. Paul can say the same thing when he addresses the way grace has been at work in his life as an apostle. He testifies that he worked harder than all the apostles, but the decisive credit for the work goes to the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10).

### <span id="page-161-0"></span>PHILIPPIANS 2:19–24

**<sup>19</sup>** I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. **20**For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. **21**For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. **22**But you know Timothy's*<sup>1</sup>* proven worth, how as a son*<sup>2</sup>* with a father he has served with me in the gospel. **<sup>23</sup>** I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, **<sup>24</sup>** and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.

1Greek *his* 2Greek *child*

### *Section Overview*

Paul presents Timothy as a son and coworker who shares the mind of Christ with Paul. Timothy is a real-life example giving texture to the exhortation to seek the interests of others. God's servants put the mind-set of Christ on display not by pursuing selfish interests but by seeking the interests of Christ and showing genuine concern for others.

Paul's words about Timothy come in carefully structured pairs:

The center of this chiasm reveals the real contrast between true and false gospel workers: the mind of Christ. False workers seek their own interests; genuine workers seek the interests of Christ Jesus (table 2.10).

### *Comment*

2:19 Two things stand out in this verse: (1) Christ is Lord over Paul's plans, and (2) Paul's heart is bound up with the Philippians' progress in the gospel. Paul's discussion of his plans puts the lordship of Christ on display: "I hope in the Lord Jesus" to send Timothy. Jesus is Lord over every area of Paul's life. Even in a seemingly "minor" matter like the sending of Timothy, Paul does not operate independently of Christ.

Second, the purpose clause shows that Paul's joy is tied to the welfare of the Philippians and the progress of the gospel among them, not his own welfare. Paul never leaves his central concern in this letter: the spread of the gospel among the Philippians.

<span id="page-162-1"></span>2:20 Verses 19 and 20 share a specific phrase tying this discussion back to the main point of the letter (1:27) and the parallel point from Paul's update (1:12). Perhaps my own translation will highlight the parallels:

I want you to know, brothers, that the things according to me [*ta kat' eme*] have really served to advance the gospel. (1:12)

I may hear the things concerning you [*ta peri hymōn*] that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel. (1:27)

<span id="page-163-4"></span><span id="page-163-3"></span>I hope in the Lord to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by the things concerning you [*ta peri hymōn*]. (2:19)

For I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for the things concerning you [*ta peri hymōn*]. (2:20)

<span id="page-163-1"></span>Just as they received an update from Paul of his standing firm for the spread of the gospel despite his suffering (1:12), so he wants to hear of their standing firm in the gospel despite their suffering (1:27). Now he tells them that he is sending Timothy to receive such a report so that he can rejoice because of their progress in the gospel (2:19). Paul can confidently send Timothy because he knows Timothy shares with him the heart and mind of Christ. He, like Paul, is genuinely concerned for the Philippians.

<span id="page-163-5"></span>2:21 Paul contrasts Timothy's uniqueness with others' inclination to seek their own interests. Here again is my own translation:

Timothy is genuinely concerned for the things concerning you [*ta peri hymōn*]. (2:20)

All others seek the things of themselves [*ta heautōn*]. (2:21)

This selfishness plagues all of humanity. Paul's reference to "all" who seek their own interests also takes the reader back to the situation Paul himself faces in Rome, where some preach Christ out of envy, rivalry, and selfish ambition (Phil. 1:15, 17).

<span id="page-163-6"></span><span id="page-163-2"></span>2:22 Paul testifies to Timothy's "proven worth." Paul has had plenty of opportunities to see Timothy's character. Time and again Timothy has passed the test and shown proven gospel character and displayed the mind of Christ. The Philippians would already "know" Timothy's proven character because he was with Paul as part of the original church planting team in Philippi (Acts 16:1–40).

<span id="page-163-0"></span>Paul also gives a tender explanation for why Timothy shares Paul's heart for the Philippians. The expression "like father, like son" captures their united heart for the Philippians. Timothy has a special kinship to Paul. This family language conveys intimacy and affection, but it also says much more. The "father/son" imagery adds a note of apprenticeship or discipleship. In the ancient world a son would learn the family craft side by side with his father. The Philippians should accept Timothy because he has been well trained and tested at the side of his spiritual father in the family craft of the cause of Christ.

This verse also contains a crucial principle for gospel partnership: Paul does not elevate himself above his coworkers. It is not one gospel minister at the top calling the shots, with everyone else obeying and falling in line. Timothy does not serve Paul but serves "with" Paul.

<span id="page-164-8"></span><span id="page-164-7"></span>2:23–24 Verse 23 uses a Greek word (*oun*) that signals a conclusion ("therefore"). *Because* of Timothy's uniqueness and proven worth and their shared heart for the Philippians, *therefore* Paul is eager to send him to Philippi. The only thing delaying the sending is Paul's need for more precise knowledge of "the things concerning me" (*ta peri eme*). Paul may be released from prison, or he could be poured out as a drink offering in death (2:17–18).

<span id="page-164-9"></span><span id="page-164-6"></span><span id="page-164-5"></span>Paul concludes this section by expressing his confident trust in the Lordship of Christ. He "hope[s] in the Lord" (v. 19) to send Timothy and "trust[s] in the Lord" (v. 24) that he himself may come soon. All of Paul's plans are placed under the sovereign rule and care of Jesus.

### *Response*

### THE LORDSHIP OF CHRIST OVER OUR PLANS

Paul has stirringly reminded the Philippians that every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. How does this elevated vision of the exalted Christ apply to everyday life? For one thing, it puts on display how Jesus is Lord over all of our plans.

<span id="page-164-0"></span>God's sovereign rule over the plans of man is a rich theme in Scripture. The book of Proverbs frequently strikes this chord: "The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps" (Prov. 16:9). Therefore, we should not arrogantly boast about our plans: "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring" (Prov. 27:1). The book of James addresses this theme further, showing why such boasts are evil:

<span id="page-164-10"></span><span id="page-164-1"></span>Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"—yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that." As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. (James 4:13–16)

<span id="page-164-11"></span><span id="page-164-4"></span><span id="page-164-3"></span>Jesus' lordship over Paul's plans shows up in all of Paul's letters (Rom. 1:10; 15:32; 1 Cor. 4:19; etc.). It is simply the way the NT talks, even about its own writing. The author of Hebrews admits, "This we will do *if God permits*" (Heb. 6:3). Is this the way we talk about and think about all our plans?

### DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MIND OF CHRIST

<span id="page-164-2"></span>Jesus modeled (Mark 3:14) and commanded (Matt. 28:19) discipleship. Paul saw the discipleship of his co-laborers as part of his ministerial labor. The cause of Christ is too big to be fulfilled by independent-minded laborers. We need an army of workers. Ministry will have individuals that we invest *in*, but it will also have teams we invest *with* as we disciple others. Ministry teams should be thought of in discipleship terms, not merely employment terms. A ministry team sharing the mind of Christ under his lordship will be a powerful force for his cause.

### PHILIPPIANS 2:25–30

**<sup>25</sup>** I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, **<sup>26</sup>** for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. **<sup>27</sup>** Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. **<sup>28</sup>** I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. **<sup>29</sup>** So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, **<sup>30</sup>** for he nearly died*<sup>1</sup>* for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.

1Or *he drew near to the point of death*; compare verse 8

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-165-3"></span>The main point of these verses is found in the call to receive Epaphroditus and to honor people like him (2:29). He should be received and honored because he models the mind-set of Christ. Table 2.11 summarizes similarities between Epaphroditus and Jesus.

<span id="page-165-4"></span><span id="page-165-1"></span>

<span id="page-165-0"></span>TABLE 2.11: The Christlike Example of Epaphroditus

<span id="page-165-2"></span>Epaphroditus also models the mind of Christ by regarding the Philippians as more important than himself. Even at his lowest point (near death), he was more distressed at the thought of the Philippians' distress concerning him than at the thought of his own death. Paul also proves to be a model of the mind of Christ in the way he thinks about sending Epaphroditus.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-166-5"></span>2:25 Paul's word choices tie this section to earlier topics of discussion:

"in humility count [*hēgeomai* ] others more significant than yourselves" (2:3) Jesus "did not count [*hēgeomai* ] equality with God a thing to be grasped" (2:6) "I have thought [*hēgeomai* ] it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus" (2:25)

<span id="page-166-2"></span>"but to remain in the flesh is more necessary [*anankaios*] on your account" (1:24)

"I have thought it necessary [*anankaios*] to send to you Epaphroditus" (2:25)

By repeating such terms, Paul is prompting the Philippians to view his decision to send Epaphroditus as an example of counting them more significant than himself. He models the mind of Christ in considering their needs above his own.

The rest of 2:25 provides five different descriptions of Epaphroditus. Three descriptions connect him to Paul ("*my* brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier"), while two link him to the Philippians ("*your* messenger and minister to my need").

<span id="page-166-9"></span><span id="page-166-8"></span><span id="page-166-7"></span><span id="page-166-6"></span>2:26–28 Verses 26–27 provide two reasons for sending Epaphroditus (he was "longing"49 for the Philippians and was "distressed"), while verse 28 gives two purposes Paul hopes to accomplish in sending him (their joy will increase; his anxiety will decrease). Verses 27–28 contain a wordplay (*lypē*/*alypos*) that magnifies God's mercy. God spared the life of Epaphroditus, and in so doing spared Paul from "sorrow upon sorrow" (*lypēn epi lypēn*). Now Paul will be spared from "anxiety" (*alypoteros*) when he sends Epaphroditus back to the Philippians.

Epaphroditus is a model of the mind of Christ in counting the Philippians as more significant than himself. Perhaps the highest point of Epaphroditus's concern for the Philippians came when he was at his lowest point. Even when sick and near death, he was not distressed about his own death. He was instead *distressed by the Philippians' distress*! He knew they would be distressed when they found out he was sick. What a touching testimony to the mind of Christ!

<span id="page-166-10"></span>2:29 Paul gives two commands: "receive" Epaphroditus and "honor" people like him. The first command includes two phrases showing how to carry out the action: "in the Lord" and "with all joy." These two phrases represent two prominent themes in Philippians: (1) the whole Christian life takes place "in the Lord" (1:14; 2:19, 24, 29), and (2) gospel partnerships are full of joy (*chara*; 1:4, 25; 2:2,

<span id="page-166-1"></span><span id="page-166-0"></span><sup>49</sup> Paul and Epaphroditus share the same longing (*epipotheō*) to see the Philippians (1:8; 2:26).

<span id="page-167-3"></span>29; 4:1). The second command ("honor") gives the Philippians a chance to avoid a self-centered focus by identifying evidences of grace in Epaphroditus and others like him.

<span id="page-167-2"></span><span id="page-167-0"></span>2:30 Epaphroditus is a model of Christ-like ministry and an embodiment of the suffering servant (2:5–11). Paul uses a chiasm to draw further attention to how far Epaphroditus was willing to go to serve Paul's need. Matthew Harmon's translation of the chiasm nicely captures the interplay between Christ/serving and death/ risking life:50

- A. because of the work of Christ
	- B. to the point of death he was near
	- B'. risking his life
- A'. to complete what was lacking in your service to me

<span id="page-167-1"></span>The last part of the chiasm also points the reader back to the Philippians' sacrificial service of worship (2:17), as both texts share the same word for "service" (ESV "offering"; *leitourgia*).

### *Response*

IS GETTING SICK SUFFERING FOR CHRIST?

Epaphroditus got sick and almost died, and Paul declares this suffering was "for Christ" because Epaphroditus "risk[ed] his life for the sake of Christ" (2:30). Others could have caught the same sickness but it would not have been suffering for Christ if they were living for themselves and not risking anything for Christ. Suffering that comes on the path of obedience *to Christ* is suffering *for Christ*. Epaphroditus opened himself up to the risk of suffering the moment he left the comfort of his normal routine in Philippi and traveled to Rome to minister to Paul. Epaphroditus also trusted God amid his suffering; he was not a self-centered grumbler. Even with a life-threatening illness, he was more concerned for others than for himself.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-168-1"></span><span id="page-168-0"></span>Paul calls the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord as a safeguard against the counterfeit gospel offered by the false teachers. Paul seeks to protect the gospel joy of the Philippians by skillfully using irony to turn the tables on the false teachers. Verses 2–3 are a carefully constructed contrast between the false teachers as counterfeit and false (v. 2) and the Philippians as genuine and true (v. 3). Paul's depiction of the false teachers is not a childish act of random name-calling. What the false teachers call true is actually false, and what they call false is actually true. Paul then shows that the Philippians have the real thing: a true identity in Christ. Christians are the true circumcision: they worship God in the Spirit, boast in Jesus, and forsake confidence in the flesh.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-169-7"></span>3:1 The Greek phrase translated "finally" functions as a formal signal that Paul has transitioned to a *new* section, not the *final* or last section of the letter. It is a transitional phrase, not a terminal phrase signaling the end of the discussion.51

<span id="page-169-8"></span>The command to rejoice is itself not new. Multiple times in multiple ways, Paul has called the Philippians to make much of Christ and rejoice in him.52 Indeed, Paul admits that he is saying "the same things" again. Some commentators take the "same things" as a reference to what follows in verses 2–11,53 but I think a much stronger case can be made to take the phrase as a reference to the command to rejoice that precedes it.54

<span id="page-169-10"></span><span id="page-169-2"></span>Paul gives not only the command to rejoice but also the rationale. He almost apologizes for boring his readers or belaboring the point through repetition but reassures them it is no problem for him personally (not a "trouble"), and even more so it is good for them corporately ("safe for you"). In what sense is the call to rejoice "safe" for the Philippians? Use of the word elsewhere could suggest that repeating the call to joy will make the point more firmly anchored (Heb. 6:19: a sure anchor) or more securely locked (Acts 16:23–24: a securely locked prison, with feet fastened in the stocks) in their hearts and minds. This is certainly true—repetition can drive a point deeper so that it stays with us longer. Paul, however, has more in mind than the safeguard of repetition; he connects the safeguard of rejoicing to the danger of false teaching in verse 2.55 Joy in Jesus serves as a shield against false teaching.

3:2 The opponents here appear to be different than the ones Paul mentioned earlier in the letter.56 This verse includes a powerful and skillful display of irony. Paul takes language Jews would have used against Gentile believers (e.g., "dogs") and turns the tables by applying the language to the Jewish false teachers.

<span id="page-169-1"></span>First, Paul calls the false teachers "dogs." Jews would label non-Jews as unclean dogs because, instead of eating a kosher diet, Gentiles ate indiscriminately, just as dogs do. Jesus uses the label for a Gentile woman in Matthew 15:26, but the narrative there highlights that she is an illustration of Jesus' teaching that people are made unclean not by what goes into the mouth but by what comes out of the heart (Matt. 15:1–20). Unclean hearts make unclean people, and the Pharisees were

54 See especially Bockmuehl, *Philippians*, 180; Hansen, *Philippians*, 213. Jeffrey Reed makes an excellent case that "anaphora" (a reference pointing back to the previous statement) is used more frequently than "kataphora" (a reference pointing forward to the statements to come). He looks at a comparison of multiple language systems and concludes that a backward looking reference "is easier on the interpretative faculties of the reader." See Jeffrey Reed, *A Discourse Analysis of Philippians*, LNTS 136 (Bloomsbury: T & T Clark, 1997), 255.

<span id="page-169-6"></span><span id="page-169-5"></span><sup>52</sup> In the immediate context, Paul has called upon the Philippians to rejoice four times (2:17–18) and has asked them to receive Epaphroditus with all joy (2:29).

<span id="page-169-9"></span><span id="page-169-4"></span><span id="page-169-3"></span><sup>56</sup> The precise identity of Paul's opponents is exceedingly difficult. It is clear that the tone he takes with these opponents is radically different from the one he adopted when describing the rivalry some had with him earlier in the letter (1:16–17). Despite the fact that the opponents mentioned earlier preached with false motives, Paul was able to rejoice in the proclamation of Christ (1:18). There is no rejoicing here. He sternly rebukes their reliance upon the flesh and stresses that Christians are those who put no confidence in the flesh (3:3) but instead put all their confidence in Christ (3:7–11).

<span id="page-170-4"></span><span id="page-170-3"></span><span id="page-170-2"></span>worst of all. They were like tombs: pretty on the outside but full of dead men's bones on the inside. The narrative contrasts the unbelief and uncleanness of the Pharisees with the faith of the Gentile woman (who would have been regarded as unclean). Jesus tells her that it would not be right to take the children's food and give it to the dogs (Matt. 15:26), but her faith surges forward when she says that even dogs eat the crumbs from their master's table (v. 27). Jesus then commends the greatness of her faith (v. 28). In other words, Jesus is saying that this Gentile woman with an unclean diet is "clean" by faith, whereas the Pharisees with their clean diet are unclean because of their unbelief and evil hearts. In the same way, Paul states that these Jewish false teachers are dogs because their reliance on the flesh makes them unclean, whereas the faith of Paul's Gentile believers makes them clean.

<span id="page-170-9"></span>The second term Paul uses for the opponents is "evildoers" (or "evilworkers"), in contrast to people like Epaphroditus, Paul's "fellow worker" (Phil. 2:25). The Jewish false teachers thought that apostles like Paul were working evil because they were spreading a works-free message of salvation. The false teachers taught that one needed to add works of the law to faith in Christ in order to be saved. Paul shows that the opponents' attempt to create confidence in the flesh is an evil work because it compromises the gospel.

Jesus had similarly harsh words for how the false message of the Pharisees made their work evil: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves" (Matt. 23:15).

<span id="page-170-6"></span><span id="page-170-5"></span>The third term Paul uses for the false teachers is "mutilators," which is a play on words. The word for "circumcision" is *peritomē*; these false teachers are actually *katatomē*—mutilators. The false teachers were saying that people needed to be physically circumcised to be saved (cf. Acts 15:1). But Paul says that physical circumcision puts confidence in the flesh. The teachers are "mutilators" because their requirement of circumcision is akin to the pagan, self-inflicted cuttings prohibited in the OT (Lev. 19:28; 21:5; Deut. 14:1; Isa. 15:2; Hos. 7:14). The false teachers are not part of the true people of God but instead are more like the false prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:28), who thought cutting themselves would get God's attention or prompt him to act. Works of the flesh will not prompt God to save.

<span id="page-170-8"></span><span id="page-170-7"></span><span id="page-170-1"></span><span id="page-170-0"></span>These false teachers are tragically deceived into thinking they are doing a good work as God's servants, when in fact they are servants of Satan (2 Cor. 11:14–15, 23). As Matthew Harmon says, "Thinking they are true sons of the kingdom, they in fact are the dogs left outside of the kingdom because of their insistence on Jewish supremacy."57 The next verse shows that Jewish supremacy has no place in Christian identity.

<span id="page-170-10"></span>3:3 In contrast to the false teachers (i.e., the mutilators), true believers in Christ are the true circumcision. The circumcision in view here is internal and stands

<sup>57</sup> Harmon, *Philippians*, 311.

<span id="page-171-3"></span>in sharp contrast to the external circumcision the false teachers required. True believers have all received a heart change: circumcision of the heart, not the flesh. Paul teaches the same thing in Romans 2:28–29: "No one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter."

<span id="page-171-1"></span><span id="page-171-0"></span>This circumcised heart or heart change is a promised part of the new covenant (Ezek. 36:26). Another aspect of the new covenant is the gift of the Holy Spirit, as the Lord promises: "I will put my Spirit within you" (Ezek. 36:27). This gift of the Spirit produces pure worship, which comes "by the Spirit of God" (Phil. 3:3). Notice that Paul does not say Christians "worship the Spirit of God"; rather, he says Christians "worship *by* the Spirit of God." This raises a natural question: who is the focus of Christian worship? The third phrase in verse 3 provides the answer: Christians "glory in Christ Jesus." Jesus himself tied the Spirit's work directly to his own glory in John 16:14: "He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you." Believers boast in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Believing is boasting or glorying in Jesus. Christians glory in Christ Jesus and thus share the ambition Paul stated earlier in the letter to "honor" or make much of Jesus (Phil. 1:20). This is not to say that the Spirit is unworthy of worship; rather, the Spirit takes our worship and deflects it toward Christ, whom the Spirit is pleased to glorify.

<span id="page-171-4"></span><span id="page-171-2"></span>The last phrase of verse 3 further interprets the nature of glorying in Christ, as Paul adds that Christians "put no confidence in the flesh." Glorying in Christ must mean putting *all* confidence in Christ to save and *no* confidence in salvation by works of the flesh (cf. 3:4–6).

#### JOY IN CHRIST IS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST FALSE GOSPELS

<span id="page-171-6"></span><span id="page-171-5"></span>Paul says that rejoicing in the Lord is a safeguard (3:1) against the danger of the false teachers (v. 2). Rejoicing in the Lord is like a shield protecting Christians from the flaming darts of false teaching that Satan's servants are shooting at the Philippians. Rejoicing in Christ is like an umbrella that protects the Philippians from getting soaked by the downpour of false teaching falling all around them. Do you see that you are safest in Christ when you are most satisfied by Christ? Make him your focus! Feast much on him! I agree with Michael Reeves on this point: "Most of our Christian problems and errors of thought come about precisely through forgetting or marginalizing Christ."58

#### MAKE MUCH OF CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT

Walking in our identity as true believers in Jesus means worshiping and glorying in Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit. Believing and boasting in Christ are not works of the flesh; they are responses wrought "by the Spirit of God" (3:3). And

<sup>58</sup> Michael Reeves, *Rejoicing in Christ* (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 2015), 10.

how do we walk this path of worship? Do we look to the Spirit, or to Christ? If we look directly to Christ, we will have the Spirit's power. The Spirit has been called the shy member of the Trinity because the Spirit does not reveal himself; he reveals Christ. J. I. Packer makes this point well:

I remember walking to a church one winter evening to preach on the words, "He shall glorify Me," seeing the building floodlit as I turned a corner, and realizing that this was exactly the illustration my message needed. When floodlighting is well done, the floodlights are so placed that you do not see them; you are not in fact supposed to see where the light is coming from; what you are meant to see is just the building on which the floodlights are trained. The intended effect is to make it visible when otherwise it would not be seen for the darkness, and to maximize its dignity by throwing all its details into relief so that you can see it properly. This perfectly illustrates the Spirit's new covenant role. He is, so to speak, the hidden floodlight shining on the Savior.59

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-173-0"></span>Paul now shares his conversion story. Most people think of a conversion story in biographical terms (cf. Acts 22), but in Philippians 3 Paul tells his story in theological terms.

<span id="page-173-7"></span><span id="page-173-6"></span><span id="page-173-5"></span><span id="page-173-4"></span>Paul reminds the Philippians that if anyone had reason to put stock in the flesh, it was he (3:4–6). Yet, after conversion to Christ, he relegated those former things (v. 7)—and indeed all things (v. 8)—to the loss side of the ledger in comparison to the surpassing value of gaining and knowing Christ (v. 8) and being found righteous in him by faith (v. 9). Paul's passion is to know Christ in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings (v. 10). Paul wants to be conformed to Christ's death ("becoming like him in his death"; v. 10) so that he may eventually follow Christ in experiencing resurrection (v. 11). Paul reminds the Philippians that he has neither attained the goal of the resurrection nor become perfect (v. 12a), and therefore he forgets the former things and presses on in pursuit of the heavenly prize (vv. 12b–14).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-173-3"></span><span id="page-173-2"></span><span id="page-173-1"></span>What comes to our mind when we think of someone's personal testimony? Most people think in terms of sharing the story of how he or she came to be saved. It is natural to share it in a biographical way: "I was raised in a Christian home, but then I went away to college and started hanging around with the wrong crowd and was living far from God. Then I heard the gospel in church and repented of my sins and trusted Christ to save me." In recounting the story that way, one narrates the events of one's life biographically and historically. Paul does this sort of thing in the book of Acts. He tells his life story by starting with his upbringing as a Jew in Tarsus, then mentioning his time in Jerusalem and his education at the feet of Gamaliel (Acts 22:3). He grew up to be a fierce persecutor of the church in Jerusalem. He received permission to spread his wildfire of persecution to places like Damascus (vv. 3–5). When he traveled to Damascus, a great light from heaven shone around him as the resurrected Lord Jesus revealed himself to Paul (vv. 6–10). Paul's life was forever changed, and the great persecutor against Christ became the great preacher of Christ.

But there is another way to share a story of salvation. Philippians 3 is Paul's theological testimony. He gives us an inside look at the mind-set of Saul the unbeliever compared with Paul the Christian.

<span id="page-174-4"></span>3:4 Saul the non-Christian put his confidence in the flesh. Paul imagines a contest with the false teachers in which they compare reasons for confidence in the flesh. Paul says he would win.

<span id="page-174-6"></span><span id="page-174-0"></span>3:5–6 Picturing life as a ledger with two columns, gains and losses, Paul focuses first on the gains—the things that would give him confidence at the final judgment. Paul's boast had two bases: (1) his pedigree (v. 5) and (2) his performance (vv. 5–6). Paul mentions four things he inherited from birth: First, he was physically circumcised at the time prescribed in Leviticus 12:3, "on the eighth day." Second, he was included in the line of God's people, belonging to the "people of Israel." Third, he could trace his lineage specifically to the tribe of Benjamin (perhaps he was named after King Saul). Fourth, he could distance himself from other Jews as a "Hebrew of Hebrews." This probably refers to the difference between a Hebrew tied to the homeland in language and culture and a diaspora Jew who had lost touch with various aspects of Hebrew language and culture.60

Paul's second category in describing his pre-conversion confidence in the flesh is a list of three things he had personally attained instead of inheriting. First, Paul voluntarily joined the strictest religious sect, the Pharisees. They applied the ritual purity laws to all of life, not merely to life in the temple. Second, Paul was zealous as a persecutor of the church. This zeal was part of his confidence in things that would commend him to God. Phinehas, after all, was commended for his zeal in killing an unfaithful Israelite (Num. 25:7–8, 11, 13), and Paul, persecutor of "unfaithful Israelites," expected similar commendation. Paul was the fulfillment of what Jesus said in John 16:2–3:

<span id="page-174-2"></span><span id="page-174-1"></span>They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.

Third, pre-conversion Paul believed he was living an exemplary life in terms of the righteous requirements of the law.

<span id="page-174-7"></span><span id="page-174-5"></span>3:7 Conversion meant that the ledger of Paul's life radically changed. The first thing Paul did was take all the things from verses 4–6 that he once regarded as gain and put them on the loss side of the ledger.

<span id="page-174-8"></span>3:8–11 These next four verses are one long sentence in Greek. Paul now goes far beyond merely regarding the things he mentioned in verses 4–6 as loss. He moves all things to the loss column until one thing remains as gain: Christ. The plus side

<span id="page-174-3"></span><sup>60</sup> It is also possible that Paul is distinguishing between Hebrew- or Aramaic-speaking Jews and Greek-speaking Jews (cf. Acts 6:1).

of Paul's ledger is now pure. Paul has already said that he puts no confidence in the flesh but instead completely glories in Christ Jesus (v. 3). He now states his case clearly again: he will place confidence for justification or right standing before God in nothing except Christ.

Paul next takes an even more radical step. He goes so far as to say that all things are not just "loss" but "rubbish" (*skybalon*) compared to Christ. *Skybalon* refers to "useless or undesirable material subject to disposal."61 It has a range of meaning from garbage to dung.

<span id="page-175-3"></span>We should be careful to note here that Paul is not denigrating or devaluing everything in creation, which God created good. He is not tearing down everything as worthless; rather, he is glorying in Christ (cf. Phil. 3:3) and lifting him higher than all created things as the One who has "surpassing worth" (v. 8) or value. Christ is in a class all by himself. Jesus did something similar when he strikingly put himself above all other allegiances to self or family: "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:26).

<span id="page-175-1"></span>One can view the relationship between Christ and his creation from two different angles. The *complementary* angle says that the good things of this world do not compete with Christ for first place—they simply cause us to adore him more because he is the source of all beauty and goodness. The *comparative* angle says that, in comparison with Christ, the nations are as a drop in the bucket or dust on the scales (Isa. 40:15). All the good things in the world are as nothing compared to him.

<span id="page-175-4"></span><span id="page-175-0"></span>Paul speaks from this second vantage point in Philippians 3:8 when he counts everything as loss "because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." The knowledge of Christ in view here is personal knowledge. Paul does not just know of Christ the way we know of people from ancient history. Believers know Jesus intimately and personally. Paul celebrates the fact that Christ has worth that surpasses everything else. He would not trade his personal relationship with Christ for anyone or anything. Paul's loss column reads *everything*; his gain column now reads *Christ*.

<span id="page-175-5"></span>3:9 This verse introduces a second purpose clause. Paul counts everything as loss in order not only to gain Christ but also to "be found in him." To be "found" in Christ conveys the language of trusting and taking refuge in something to save. On the day of judgment, some will face the wrath of God and the Lamb, and they will try to be hidden from him by calling for the mountains and rocks to fall on them and hide them (Luke 23:30). Paul will not try to be hidden *from* Christ because he will be hidden *in* him.

<span id="page-175-2"></span>Paul uses the participle "having" (*echōn*) to describe the condition in which he desires to be found on the last day. He sees it as a contrast between two different types of righteousness, one that he rejects and one that he embraces. The rest of verse 9 is a chiasm that contrasts these two types of righteousness:62

Not having my own righteousness that [is] from the Law but that [righteousness which is] through faith in Christ the [righteousness that is] from God righteousness on the basis of faith.

This chiasm reinforces the contrast between confidence in the flesh (my own righteousness, from works)63 and confidence in Christ (faith in Christ). Therefore, the center of the chiasm is the righteousness through faith in Christ: such faith should be embraced and all other righteousness rejected. Pre-conversion Saul put confidence in a personal righteousness consisting of his own moral performance in obedience to the law. Paul's conversion came by embracing the righteousness of Jesus, not earned by works but received as a gift by faith. The righteousness a holy God demands of us, he gives to us in Christ.

<span id="page-176-4"></span>3:10 Here Paul introduces the third purpose of counting all things as loss: "that I may know him." This purpose is the greatest of all. Knowing Christ includes knowing the "power of his resurrection" and also knowing what it means to "share his sufferings."

<span id="page-176-0"></span>The greatest joy this life has to offer is to know Christ. Jesus proclaims, "This is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" (John 17:3). Jeremiah 9:23–24 says that the one who boasts should boast that he understands and knows God. The difference between knowing about Jesus and really knowing Jesus makes all the difference in this world and the next.

Knowing Christ involves knowing him in both his death and his resurrection. Paul begins by talking about the resurrection. He refers to more than the mere historical fact of the resurrection, pointing to the *power* of Christ's resurrection. Paul discusses the power connected to the resurrection in a few places in his writings, but perhaps the clearest place is in Ephesians 1:19–20. There Paul stunningly says that the same immeasurable power that raised Jesus from the dead lives in believers.

<span id="page-176-3"></span><span id="page-176-2"></span>But this resurrection power is experienced amid sharing in the sufferings of Christ and "becoming like him in his death." Paul has already told the Philippians that God graciously gave them the gift of suffering (Phil. 1:29). God has ordained that we will share in the sufferings of Christ, which means becoming like him in

<sup>62</sup> I first read of this chiasm in O'Brien, *Philippians*, 394.

<span id="page-176-1"></span><sup>63</sup> Paul's pre-conversion mind-set matched the mind-set of his unsaved Jewish countrymen in Romans 10:1–3. Paul prays they may be saved because they are ignorant of the righteousness from God and thus do not submit to it. In place of divine righteousness in Christ, they attempt to establish their own.

his death. We do not suffer for the sake of suffering as though, in and of itself, suffering makes us like Jesus. Paul is referring to suffering *as Jesus did*: for the sake of serving others in obedience to the Father. "Becoming like" (*symmorphizō*) means to "to cause to be similar in form or style to something else."64 The passive voice here probably signals a divine passive meaning—God is causing us to become like Christ in his death. Sinclair Ferguson once said in a sermon that God makes us like Jesus the same way Jesus became like Jesus: through suffering (Heb. 2:10; 5:8). Paul is not telling us to go look for ways to suffer. The message of Philippians counsels us to have the mind of Christ: go look for someone to serve for the cause of Christ and do not be deterred by suffering. Pursue Christlikeness, not misery.

<span id="page-177-9"></span><span id="page-177-8"></span><span id="page-177-4"></span><span id="page-177-3"></span><span id="page-177-0"></span>3:11 Sharing in suffering must come before sharing in glory, as Paul said in Romans 8:17. Paul's flow of thought is the same here: sharing in suffering and becoming like Jesus in his death will lead to the resurrection (Phil. 3:10–11). Paul's great desire is to "attain the resurrection from the dead" (v. 11). The phrase "by any means possible" models a measure of humility, not false certainty. Paul did leave open the possibility that he could preach to others but find himself disqualified (1 Cor. 9:24–27). The brightness of future resurrection breeds not apathy but diligent perseverance in pursuing Christ.

<span id="page-177-5"></span><span id="page-177-2"></span><span id="page-177-1"></span>3:12 This verse counters a potential false conclusion and affirms the right conclusion in its place. Paul clarifies that he has not attained the resurrection or already arrived at the state of perfection that will come with the resurrection. Rather, he presses on to make the resurrection his own. The word translated "press on" (*diōkō*) is the same word Paul used earlier to describe his persecution (*diōkō*) of the church (3:6). Paul's old mind-set was a single-minded pursuit of persecuting the church. The new birth brought a new mind-set: a single-minded pursuit to know Christ and attain the resurrection. Paul describes this pursuit in humble terms, giving Jesus the credit even for Paul's pursuit of him. The underlying reason he can press on to make the resurrection his own is that Christ Jesus has already made Paul his own. The last phrase literally reads, "because I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus." The Bible will not allow us to nurture a sense of independence. We love because he first loved us. We work because he works in us. We can make the resurrection and knowing Christ our own because he has made us his own.

<span id="page-177-7"></span><span id="page-177-6"></span>3:13–14 Paul reiterates that he has not yet made the resurrection his own. He uses the same verb, "make my own" (*katalambanō*), which he used twice in verse 12. He continues to stress his mind-set: he does not "consider" (*logizomai* ) that he has made the resurrection his own; indeed, he has slammed the door shut on any such notion. At this point, the reader has been rallied by the repetition to say, "I understand: you have not made it your own—so now what?" Paul answers with a razor sharp, single-minded focus: "one thing I do." What is this one thing? To "press on" (*diōkō*) toward the heavenly finish line and prize (v. 14). Verse 13 first explains the

means by which this one thing will happen: by forgetting the things behind and by straining for the things ahead, Paul presses on toward the final goal. The second participle, "straining forward" (*epekteinomai* ), draws on the imagery of a race in which a runner strains forward to the finish line. Pressing on in a single-minded way requires not looking back but instead leaning forward.

<span id="page-178-2"></span>The rest of the verse describes the finish line and the prize that awaits us beyond it. The "goal" (*skopos*) of a race is the finish line, the focal point on which all runners set their sights and to which they run. The prize at the end of the race is the state of perfection that comes with the resurrection. "Prize" (*brabeion*) also occurs in 1 Corinthians 9:24. "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it." This prize has a source: "the upward call of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:14). The call is upward in that God is directing our focus to the things above, not earthly things. The next section reinforces this focus.

### <span id="page-178-4"></span>*Response*

#### KEEP YOUR CONFIDENCE COLUMN SINGULAR

<span id="page-178-0"></span>False teaching tries to make less of Christ by smuggling more of the flesh into the confidence column of salvation. Real Christianity keeps our confidence column singular: Christ alone saves. False teaching's focus on the flesh (on what we do) inevitably minimizes our confidence in what Christ has already done. Gospel worship says, "I must decrease and he must increase" (cf. John 3:30). False gospels implicitly say, "I must increase and Christ must decrease." Self-righteousness is the suicide of Christian faith and joy; rejoicing in Jesus is the shield against such self-righteousness.

#### THE GREATEST GIFT OF THE GOSPEL

John Piper once made the case in a sermon that forgiveness is not the highest good of the gospel—God is. When I sin against my wife, it is good and natural to want forgiveness, but why do I want to be forgiven? The answer is not some benefit my wife brings, such as making supper or washing the clothes. How would my wife respond if I said, "I need you to forgive me so that you will make my supper"? Why do I want to be forgiven? Because I want my wife back! I want her.

<span id="page-178-3"></span><span id="page-178-1"></span>Why do you want to be forgiven? Paul says we should want to be forgiven so that we will know Jesus. Why does Paul want to be resurrected? So he can see Christ faceto-face. His great desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better than anything else (Phil. 1:21). Some people treat Jesus like a ticket to heaven. However, you throw a ticket away once you get to where you were going. You wanted entrance to the place, not the piece of paper. Everyone wants to go to heaven, but not for the same reasons. Bad theology is often shown in false views of heaven. Is heaven a place that gives greater access to idols? There will be splendors and wonders of the new heavens and new earth for our resurrection bodies, but we will enjoy them as part of the overflow of enjoying Christ. Eternal life is knowing him (John 17:3).

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-179-8"></span><span id="page-179-7"></span><span id="page-179-6"></span><span id="page-179-5"></span>Paul calls for the Philippians to embrace his pattern of thinking (3:15–17) from the previous passage (3:12–14). He calls them to emulate his example and keep their eyes on others who walk in a similar manner (3:17). There are two ways to walk, leading to two radically different destinations. Some walk as enemies of the cross (3:18), setting their minds on earthly things; their end will be destruction (3:19). True believers do not set their minds on earthly things, for their citizenship is in heaven (3:20). *Their* end will be bodily transformation and resurrection when Jesus returns (3:21). Paul closes this section ("therefore") by expressing his love for and joy in the Philippians, urging them to stand firm in the Lord (4:1).

<span id="page-179-11"></span><span id="page-179-10"></span><span id="page-179-9"></span><span id="page-179-4"></span><span id="page-179-3"></span><span id="page-179-2"></span><span id="page-179-1"></span><span id="page-179-0"></span>Four similarities tie 3:1–14 and 3:15–21 together. First, the present passage (3:15–17) calls upon the Philippians to share Paul's pattern of thinking demonstrated in the previous passage (3:4–14) ("think this way"; 3:15). Second, 3:15 says Paul already possesses something partially ("maturity," *teleios*) that 3:12 says he will one day possess fully ("become perfect," *teleioō*). Third, Paul shows that Christians and their opponents are polar opposites. In 3:2–3 he demonstrated that Christians are the true circumcision ( *peritomē*), while their opponents are the false circumcision, the mutilators (*katatomē*). In 3:19–20 Paul presents the believers and their opponents as operating from opposite spheres: the earthly and the heavenly. Fourth, the language of "conform" ("become like") provides verbal links connecting the two passages, while the resurrection provides thematic unity. Paul longs to be "conformed" (*symmorphizō*) to Christ's death (3:10)

<span id="page-180-15"></span><span id="page-180-6"></span>in order to attain the resurrection (3:11), while later he stresses that the believer's transformed body will "conform to," or "be like" (*symmorphos*) Christ's glorious body (3:21). The first passage is all about Paul's personal longing for the resurrection (3:11–14), while the second concerns the corporate longing of believers for the resurrection (3:20–21).

<span id="page-180-14"></span><span id="page-180-7"></span>Further, as seen in table 2.12, five vocabulary links connect this section to the thesis section of 1:27–30.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-180-8"></span><span id="page-180-5"></span><span id="page-180-1"></span>3:15 "Think this way" refers to Paul's single-minded pattern of thinking about Christ in the previous passage (3:4–14). Paul has such confidence that God will complete the work he began (1:6) that he confidently asserts that if some in Philippi do not think this way, "God will reveal that" to them. Paul does not expound upon how God will reveal it to the Philippians, but he probably believes God will do so through this very letter.

<span id="page-180-11"></span><span id="page-180-10"></span><span id="page-180-9"></span><span id="page-180-4"></span>3:16–17 "Only" ( *plēn*) signals the main point of this discussion: the Philippians should not become fixated with those who disagree but should have a singular focus ("only") on holding true "to what we have attained" (3:16), the spiritual "maturity" of verse 15. This spiritual maturity is the single-minded focus on Christ that Paul has modeled (3:4–11). Verse 17 adds two imperatives to sum up the call of verses 15–17: The Philippians must (1) "join in imitating" Paul and must (2) "keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us." This verse is a wonderfully compact summary of Philippians, as throughout this letter Paul has offered examples the Philippians could keep their eyes on. Paul uses

<span id="page-181-5"></span><span id="page-181-2"></span>his coworkers (2:19–30) and himself (1:12–26; 3:4–11) as examples, and Christ as the preeminent example (2:5–11).

<span id="page-181-10"></span><span id="page-181-8"></span><span id="page-181-7"></span>3:18–19 Just as not everyone thinks the way Paul thinks (3:15), not everyone walks the way he and his coworkers "walk" ( *peripateō*) (v. 17). Following the right examples is essential because "many" (not just a few) do not walk that way. They walk as enemies of the cross (v. 18).

<span id="page-181-11"></span><span id="page-181-9"></span><span id="page-181-4"></span><span id="page-181-1"></span>No one knows the precise identity of these individuals, but Paul gives a fourfold snapshot of their way of life in verse 19: (1) "their end is destruction," (2) "their god is their belly," (3) "they glory in their shame," and (4) their minds are "set on earthly things." Paul cannot think of these enemies of the cross without tears, for their final destination is destruction (cf. 1:28). The fact that their god is their belly (*koilia*) probably means something similar to the truth expressed in Romans 16:18: "Such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites [*koilia*], and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive." The third description ("they glory in their shame") is highly ironic: they are proud of things that should cause them shame. Paul's language probably echoes the Greek translation of Hosea 4:7, where God warns, "I will turn their glory into dishonor."65 If Paul intended this echo, the point is that the enemies of the cross in Paul's day would face the same fate as those unfaithful to the covenant in Hosea's day.66 The fourth characteristic of the enemies of the cross is the most far-reaching: they set their minds "on earthly things." This description is a glaring warning concerning the need for the mind-set Paul has called the Philippians to adopt throughout the letter.

<span id="page-181-13"></span><span id="page-181-3"></span><span id="page-181-0"></span>3:20–21 Paul is quick to contrast the earthly mind-set of the enemies of the cross with the heavenly citizenship of the Philippians. Table 2.13 shows how this language hearkens back to the thesis statement of Philippians 1:27.

<span id="page-181-6"></span>Heaven's citizens await the return of their heavenly Savior (*sōtēr*). Roman emperors viewed themselves as the "saviors"67 of Rome's citizens, but heaven's citizens know that Caesar is a counterfeit savior. Jesus alone is Savior (3:20) and Lord (v. 8). Jesus is unparalleled as Savior in part because he has the power to do what counterfeit saviors are powerless to do: transform the believer's body of humility "to be like" (or "to be similar in form to"; *symmorphos*) the body of Christ's glory. This act of power is in keeping with the fact that Christ has unparalleled power that "enables him even to subject all things to himself" (v. 21).

<span id="page-181-14"></span><sup>65</sup> This echo is somewhat unclear; the LXX has *atimia* ("dishonor") instead of Paul's term *aischynē* ("shame"). 66 So also Harmon, *Philippians*, 376. It is also possible that the two groups are similar in that their lifestyle does not match their profession.

<sup>67</sup> Even the Jewish historian Josephus refers to the emperors Augustus ( *Jewish Wars* 1.625) and Vespasian ( *Jewish Wars* 3.459) as "Savior."

4:1 Paul takes most of this verse to express his affection for the Philippians in a fourfold way. The Philippians are: (1) "brothers," (2) those whom Paul loves and longs for, (3) Paul's "joy and crown," and (4) "beloved." These words of affection sweeten the exhortation to "stand firm thus in the Lord." Recall that this is the second term in this section echoing the thesis of 1:27 (see table 2.14).

### <span id="page-182-2"></span>TABLE 2.14: Comparison of Philippians 1:27 and 4:1

<span id="page-182-5"></span><span id="page-182-4"></span>We argued that the "one spirit" of 1:27 was a reference to the Holy Spirit. Here Paul stresses that the place to take one's stand is "in the Lord." Paul thus brings back to mind his single-minded focus on Christ from 3:4–14 and the warning not to drift into following the earthly mind-set of some (3:19) or the confidence-in-the-flesh mind-set of the false teachers (3:2–6).

### <span id="page-182-3"></span>*Response*

### A THEOLOGY OF HOPE TAKES THE LONG VIEW

Paul wants the Philippians to stand firm without fear, for the outcome of the war between earthly citizens and heavenly citizens is sure. It is easy to forget that God is in control because at times it looks like the church is losing, not winning. But we must not lose heart. The opponents of the church will be destroyed, while believers will be saved. The gates of hell will not be able to withstand the advance of the gospel (Matt. 16:18). The whole "earth will be filled with the . . . glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea" (Hab. 2:14). Life is short. Eternity is long. Hell is hot. Heaven is real. The battle is won. Jesus is Lord. And he is coming soon. Stand firm (Phil. 4:1).

<span id="page-182-6"></span><span id="page-182-1"></span><span id="page-182-0"></span>C. H. Spurgeon compares the battle before us to the ebb and flow of the tides:

You never met an old salt, down by the sea, who was in trouble because the tide had been ebbing out for hours. No! He waits confidently for the turn of the tide, and it comes in due time. Yonder rock has been uncovered during the last half-hour, and if the sea continues to ebb out for weeks, there will be no water in the English Channel, and the French will walk over from Cherbourg. Nobody talks in that childish way, for such an ebb will never come. Nor will we speak as though the gospel would be routed, and eternal truth driven out of the land. We serve an almighty Master. . . . If our Lord does but stamp His foot, He can win for Himself all the nations of the earth against heathenism, and Mohammedanism, and Agnosticism, and Modern-thought, and every other foul error. Who is he that can harm us if we follow Jesus? How can His cause be defeated? At His will, converts will flock to His truth as numerous as the sands of the sea.68

**<sup>2</sup>** I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord. **3**Yes, I ask you also, true companion,*<sup>1</sup>* help these women, who have labored*<sup>2</sup>* side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

1Or *loyal Syzygus*; Greek *true yokefellow* 2Or *strived* (see 1:27)

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-183-2"></span>This passage is the climax of the body of the letter. Paul urges two prominent women in the church to "agree in the Lord" (4:2). This exhortation is not an *afterthought* to the gospel; it is an *application*. Reconciliation is gospel application. The gospel is relevant for all of life, including personal conflicts. Gospel reconciliation requires gospel thinking. Paul's joy and the Philippians' joy are both at stake. Look again at the similarities between this passage and 2:2 (AT):

<span id="page-183-1"></span>Complete my joy so that you may think the same thing (*to auto phronēte*). (2:2)

I urge Euodia and Syntyche to think the same thing (*to auto phronein*) in the Lord. (4:2)

Disunity will quickly dissolve a gospel partnership, so Paul asks someone to help these women reconcile. The women can *reconcile in the gospel* now because they were *contending for the gospel* at Paul's side, just as Clement and the rest of Paul's coworkers were (4:3).

<span id="page-183-3"></span>This passage has a key connection to the thesis verse of the letter (table 2.15).

- a. The Need for Gospel Reconciliation (4:2)
- b. The Need for Gospel Mediation (4:3)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-184-4"></span><span id="page-184-3"></span>4:2 No one knows the precise identity of these two women or the precise details of their conflict. Paul provides only their names and acknowledges that they were co-laborers in the gospel with him (4:3). The fact that Paul does not tell the Philippians more implies that the church knew these women well. Perhaps their conflict was also well known.

4:3 Paul asks an unnamed faithful companion to help apply the gospel in the cause of reconciliation. Why does Paul add that these women are co-laborers in the gospel and that their names are in the book of life (along with the rest of his coworkers)? First, if these women worked with Paul to *contend* for the gospel, they should be able to *reconcile* in the gospel. Second, they will be reconciled in heaven (their names are in the book of life together), so they can be reconciled now.

<span id="page-184-1"></span><span id="page-184-0"></span>The precise phrase "book of life" occurs two other times in Scripture (Rev. 3:5; 20:15), but the concept is a rich theme throughout (Ex. 32:32–33; Ps. 69:28; Dan. 12:1—Paul had alluded to Daniel 12 in Phil. 2:15). As those whose names are in the book of life together, Euodia and Syntyche should be shining for the Lord together (2:15), not disputing (2:14) with each other.

### <span id="page-184-2"></span>*Response*

#### THE MIND OF CHRIST AND PERSONAL CONFLICT

Personal conflict is possible for people in Christ only when they have lost the mind of Christ. The goal of a third-person mediator is very pointed: help the conflicting parties recover the mind of Christ. In the body of Christ, we can never claim irreconcilable differences. It should come as no surprise that conflict will come to fallen people living in a fallen world, but the gospel gives hope amid conflict because in Christ there are no irreconcilable differences. The word "irreconcilable" (ESV "unappeasable") appears only once in the NT: in 2 Timothy 3:3, where it describes non-Christians. The word literally means "no offering" or "no altar." The cross has cancelled out the word "irreconcilable" because Christ was slain on the altar as a sacrifice sufficient for forgiveness.

<span id="page-184-5"></span>All differences will be resolved between brothers and sisters in Christ in heaven. Because they *will be* resolved there, we have hope they *can be* resolved here. As much as it depends upon us, we should try to be at peace with all people because of our belief in the gospel. Do you need to apply the gospel and reconcile with someone? Do you need to apply the gospel by helping others reconcile?

The Lord is at hand; **6**do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. **7**And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

**<sup>8</sup>**Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. **9**What you have learned*<sup>2</sup>* and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-185-4"></span><span id="page-185-3"></span><span id="page-185-2"></span><span id="page-185-1"></span>Paul brings the body of the letter to a close with a rapid-fire flurry of seven exhortations. He calls the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord (twice; 4:4), let all see their gentleness (ESV "reasonableness"; 4:5), be anxious about nothing (4:6), pray about everything (4:6–7), set their minds on the right things (4:8), and emulate Paul's teaching and lifestyle (4:9). All of these exhortations should be interpreted as specific examples of what it looks like to "behave as citizens worthy of the gospel" (1:27 ESV mg.), telling each Christian how to "work out your own salvation" (2:12).

II.C. Main Body Closing: Final Exhortations (4:4–9)

- 1. Rejoice Always (4:4)
- 2. Be Gentle with Everyone (4:5)
- 3. Be Anxious about Nothing (4:6a)
- 4. Pray about Everything (4:6b–7)

### *Comment*

4:4 Two of Paul's seven commands appear in this one verse. Paul sounds an emphatic note by repeating the call to rejoice. What is even more striking is the addition of "always." The command is always in season. It is always the right time to rejoice. This focus on *always* means the Philippians can have joy in something that is always true and does not depend upon pleasant circumstances (Paul is an obvious example: he is writing about joy *while in prison facing possible death*). The Philippians can always rejoice "in the Lord" because what they have in Christ cannot fade, spoil, or expire. No one can steal their joy, for no one can take away their victory in Christ.

<span id="page-186-5"></span><span id="page-186-4"></span><span id="page-186-1"></span>4:5 The third command can be translated two different ways. The ESV translation renders it, "Let your reasonableness be known to everyone." Other translations read, "Let your gentleness be known to everyone." The case for "gentleness" is perhaps stronger, given its wider usage in the NT (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 3:2; James 3:17; 1 Pet. 2:18). In any case, this command fits with Paul's call to emulate Christ instead of looking out for one's own self-centered interests. Paul elsewhere uses a noun form of "gentleness" in highlighting the "meekness and gentleness of Christ" (2 Cor. 10:1). This disposition should mark the way the Philippians interact with "everyone," including opponents.

<span id="page-186-0"></span>It is exceedingly difficult to know how to take the next phrase, "The Lord is at hand." One could read it in two senses: (1) near in a temporal sense (Jesus is coming back soon), or (2) near in a geographical sense (Jesus is near in personal proximity right now). Both are theologically true, but the sustained emphasis in Philippians on the day of Christ probably favors the first sense. The Philippians can be kind and peaceful even to their opponents because they know Jesus is coming back soon to set all things right.

<span id="page-186-2"></span>4:6 Next come the fourth and fifth commands. The Philippians should not be anxious but should pray. The all-inclusive scope of these commands stands out once again: do not be anxious about *anything*, but pray in *everything*. The contrast between anxiety and praying is instructive, because we can either carry our cares (i.e., anxiety) or remove our cares by giving them to God in prayer. We do not make our requests known to God because God lacks knowledge of them; we make our requests known so that we may be free from anxiety. We make these requests "by prayer and supplication." The first word, "prayer," is a general term for communicating with God, while the second is more specific, describing "an urgent request to meet a need, exclusively addressed to God."69 Paul cares not only about the *act* of praying but also about the proper *attitude* for praying: "thanksgiving." Gratitude is the right attitude for prayer because the believer approaches a throne of grace, not judgment. God is not stingy with his grace, so believers can come boldly because they know God is for them, not against them, in Christ.

<span id="page-186-3"></span>4:7 The way this verse interrupts the pattern of commands suggests that we should read the conjunction "and" as an overflow or result of what happens when we make our requests known to God: the peace of God guards our hearts and minds. God's peace is the opposite of anxiety (v. 6). The peace the world offers depends upon peaceful circumstances, which must constantly be preserved and guarded from countless dangers. God's peace is different. Worldly peace must be guarded; *God's* peace guards *us*.

<span id="page-187-1"></span><span id="page-187-0"></span>Paul's reference to peace recalls the blessing he pronounced on those who are in Christ Jesus: "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (1:2). God's peace is a gospel gift, and thus it is experienced only "in Christ Jesus" (4:7). Paul is zealous to keep pointing to the benefits of being in Christ (1:13, 14; 2:1, 19, 24, 29; 3:1; 4:1, 2, 4, 10). This divine peace transcends earthly circumstances; thus it "surpasses all understanding." Rejoicing and resting peacefully while in prison cannot be adequately explained by the categories common to natural man. I once heard American preacher Adrian Rogers sum this principle up in a sermon: "We have no right to be believed if we can be explained." God's peace does not depend upon peaceful circumstances, and thus it transcends natural explanations that take God out of the equation.

<span id="page-187-3"></span>4:8 Paul tells the Philippians to "think about these things" after listing eight captivating graces they should ponder. They should dwell on whatever is (1) true, (2) honorable, (3) just, (4) pure, (5) lovely, (6) commendable, (7) excellent, or (8) worthy of praise. Fixing one's gaze on Christ would fulfill all of these, for he perfectly lived out all of them. He is the fullness of goodness, truth, and beauty. Stated negatively, Christians should stay away from all that is false, dishonorable, unjust, impure, ugly, improper, inferior, or unworthy.

<span id="page-187-4"></span>4:9 The seventh and final command in this section is to "practice these things," a reference to four areas of focus: (1) what you have *learned*, (2) what you have *received*, (3) what you have *heard*, and (4) what you have *seen* in me. Paul directs the Philippians' attention to the totality of all he has communicated to them in his teaching and living. The motivation for practicing these things is then stated: "The God of peace will be with you." The peace that guards us is always with us because it is tied to the presence of God, the God of peace who is always with us.

### *Response*

### REJOICE IN JESUS ALWAYS

Few things are more fatal to real Christianity than the poisonous idea that joy in Jesus is optional, not essential. We can slip into this way of thinking when a vibrant personal relationship with Jesus (joyful devotion) chills to a religious allegiance (dutiful devotion) to Jesus.

<span id="page-187-5"></span><span id="page-187-2"></span>No one can read Philippians rightly and regard one's duty to Jesus as essential but joy in Jesus as merely optional. Philippians 4:4 even says it twice for emphasis: "*Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice*." What is so striking here is not merely the repetition. Paul says something much more radical: he says to rejoice "always." Rejoice at all times. This is not unique to Philippians. Paul says the same thing in 1 Thessalonians 5:16: "Rejoice always." Always rejoicing does not mean there is never sorrow. In fact, Paul can say that sorrow and rejoicing can exist simultaneously, describing himself and Timothy as "sorrowful, yet always <span id="page-188-1"></span>rejoicing" (2 Cor. 6:10). Sorrowful circumstances will come, and may cut deep, but the undercurrent of joy runs deeper still, as a river that never runs dry.

### THE PEACE OF GOD AND THE GOD OF PEACE

C. S. Lewis once observed that if one's gaze remains fixed in the right place, the right action will follow. If one looks only at the action, the burden is placed on the person's ability to carry out the action. The believer should look to *the God of peace*, not to the *need for peace*. Personal willpower (our ability) is a pitiful substitute for God's power (almighty ability). Lewis discerned that when one's gaze turns to consider the action, both the action and object vanish together.70

Elsewhere, Paul uses Abraham as an example of how important it is for the gaze of faith to have the right object. Abraham did not allow his gaze to stay fixed on the absurdity of his dead body and Sarah's dead womb producing incalculable descendants. He had learned something about the life-giving power of God. He looked away from his inability and fixed his focus firmly on God's almighty ability by believing that God was able to do what he had promised (Rom. 4:19–21).

<span id="page-188-0"></span>The object of our gaze has either a transforming or a deforming effect, depending on whether the object is treasure or trash. The law of the soul says you become like what you watch. Fix your eyes on Jesus and all the things that point to him, and the effect will be greater Christlikeness.

### PHILIPPIANS 4:10–23

**<sup>10</sup>** I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. **11**Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. **<sup>12</sup>** I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. **<sup>13</sup>** I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

**<sup>14</sup>**Yet it was kind of you to share*<sup>1</sup>* my trouble. **15**And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. **16**Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. **17**Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.*<sup>2</sup>* **<sup>18</sup>** I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. **19**And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. **20**To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.

<span id="page-189-0"></span>As stated in the discussion of 1:1–11, letter writers would sometimes begin and end a letter with parallel words to form literary bookends. Paul begins and ends Philippians with a grace greeting and an expression of thanksgiving for gospel partnership.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-189-4"></span><span id="page-189-2"></span><span id="page-189-1"></span>4:10a This is the third time Paul has referred to rejoicing in the Lord (3:1; 4:4, 10). He points out how thoroughly his joy is bound up with the reviving of the Philippians' "concern," or shared mind-set ( *phroneō*). This shared mind-set has played a vital role in Philippians (1:7; 2:2, 5; 3:15, 19; 4:2): Paul began the letter by commenting that it was right for him to have this mind-set *concerning them* (1:7), and now he celebrates how they have that same mind-set *about him* (4:10).

<span id="page-189-3"></span>The word "reviving" refers to something that grows into full bloom (*anathallō*) after being dormant for a time. Paul is overjoyed to see the blossoming of this mind of Christ once again in the flower garden of the Philippian church.

<span id="page-190-2"></span>4:10b Paul corrects a potential misunderstanding: What he said in verse 10a might sound like he felt that the Philippians had forgotten about him but then had a change of heart and decided to help him again. Paul clarifies that he understands they were lacking not in sympathy but in opportunity. Now, they have been provided another opportunity to put the mind of Christ on display in Philippi.

<span id="page-190-3"></span>4:11–13 Next, Paul corrects a potential misunderstanding with respect to himself. It could sound like Paul was so fixated on his needs that he had lost sight of his contentment in Christ. Paul does not want to give the wrong impression, so he lays out for the Philippians a key lesson he has learned about contentment.

<span id="page-190-5"></span>Verses 12–13 unpack this lesson in detail: Contentment is not circumstantial. There is both a variable (a range of circumstances) and a constant (contentment). Paul constructs a spectrum to account for the whole range of human experience with respect to material provisions (food, clothing, and resources), with two opposing poles (bountiful surplus or extreme deficit). The amount of provision will vary (Paul is always somewhere on that spectrum), but his contentment in Christ remains constant.

<span id="page-190-6"></span><span id="page-190-4"></span>This contentment can remain constant "in any and every circumstance" because of a "secret" Paul has learned. Verse 12 gave the context in which this secret plays out, and now verse 13 will finally reveal its content: "I can do all things through him who strengthens me." The scope of "all things" involves the hardships and prosperity of verse 12. This verse should not be interpreted as a promise that believers can do anything they desire to do. It is not a promise that God will give every believer the strength to compete in the Olympics if they so desire. The secret is supremely Christological; it has no content apart from Christ and his empowering presence. Paul is carrying out the Great Commission with the power and presence of Christ. Paul can do all things through Christ because Christ has "all authority in heaven and on earth" and is always with Paul—even "to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:18, 20). In other words, Christ's power and presence encompass the whole range of human existence; there is nowhere Paul could go and nothing he could experience that could ever take him beyond the tender and strong empowering embrace of Christ.

<span id="page-190-1"></span><span id="page-190-0"></span>4:14 The conjunction "yet" introduces a break in the discussion in order to emphasize something important.71 The Philippians have shown kindness in their partnership with Paul in his affliction. In describing how they "share my trouble," Paul returns to his key term for gospel partnership (*synkoinōneō*), a theme that pervades Philippians (1:5, 7; 2:1; 3:10; 4:14, 15). Paul and the Philippians come to share in the sufferings of Christ through union with Christ together (3:10). As seen in table 2.16, shared sense of partnership is a thematic thread from the beginning and end of the letter.

<span id="page-191-8"></span><span id="page-191-7"></span>

| Verse | ESV                        | Greek       |
|-------|----------------------------|-------------|
| 1:5   | partnership in the gospel  | koinōnia    |
| 1:7   | partakers with me of grace | synkoinōnos |
| 4:14  | share my trouble           | synkoinōneō |
| 4:15  | entered into partnership   | koinōneō    |

<span id="page-191-0"></span>TABLE 2.16: Partnership as a Thematic Thread in Philippians

<span id="page-191-12"></span><span id="page-191-11"></span><span id="page-191-10"></span>4:15–16 Paul now calls attention72 to the Philippians' proven track record as faithful gospel partners by rehearsing some of the highlights of their partnership together. The Philippians entered into gospel partnership (*koinōneō*) with Paul from the very beginning of his ministry among them (v. 15). Paul puts the Philippians in a class by themselves: "except you only." He showers them with commendation in verse 16 for how they sent someone to provide for his needs on more than one occasion. The phrase "once and again" is placed at the front of the Greek sentence for emphasis. That the Philippians provided for Paul's needs multiple times in Thessalonica is all the more remarkable given Paul's short stay there (Acts 17:2 says that he spent three Sabbath days reasoning in the synagogue).

<span id="page-191-13"></span><span id="page-191-9"></span><span id="page-191-6"></span>4:17 Paul again wants to avoid giving the wrong impression. He is not looking after his own interests; he is still seeking their interests (2:3–4). He is grateful they have been looking after his physical interests, but Paul is like an investment adviser with an eye on the heavenly accounts of the Philippians. He is exceedingly glad to see overflowing increase and compound interest at work in their heavenly account. They are laying up treasures in heaven (Matt. 6:19–21); their heavenly reward is growing like a fruitful orchard.

<span id="page-191-14"></span><span id="page-191-5"></span>4:18 Paul now helps the Philippians see what their generosity means both to him ("well supplied") and to God ("pleasing"). Their generous giving has created a context in which Paul abounds. He is well supplied because he has received not merely the full amount needed, but in fact a surplus over and above the need. This extravagant giving is also an aromatic offering well pleasing to God. Paul draws here upon the imagery of the OT sacrificial system: an acceptable sacrifice was one offered in accord with God's instructions, and its fragrant aroma was said to be well pleasing to God (Ex. 29:18, 25, 41; Lev. 1:9, 13, 17; 2:2, 9, 12; 3:5; 4:31; 6:15, 21; 8:21, 28, etc.).73

<span id="page-191-15"></span><span id="page-191-2"></span><span id="page-191-1"></span>4:19 Paul stated in verse 18 that he is well supplied ( *peplērōmai* ). Now he explains that the Philippians are well supplied as well, for God will supply ( *plēroō*) the

<sup>72</sup> The use of a pronoun ("you") and direct address ("Philippians") would grab their attention. Paul does so in order to bring to mind something that is well known to them: the history of their partnership together in the gospel.

<span id="page-191-4"></span><span id="page-191-3"></span><sup>73</sup> Harmon notes the possibility that Paul may also draw upon the language of Numbers 28:2 (LXX), as both passages share the expression "fragrant aroma" (*osmēn euōdias*) and a rare word for "gift" (*doma*). He also postulates that these Philippian Gentiles' acting as end-time priests may provide a conceptual parallel to Isaiah 56:6–7, though he regards such a parallel "tentative at best" (Harmon, *Philippians*, 459n58).

Philippians' "every need . . . according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus." This promise certainly applies to the financial needs of the Philippians, but it goes beyond financial needs to cover "every need of yours." God can easily meet such needs. He not only has the riches (wealth); his character is one of boundless generosity as well. He is the God who loves to give good gifts to his children (Matt. 7:11).

<span id="page-192-8"></span><span id="page-192-0"></span>The prepositional phrase "in Christ Jesus" identifies where these riches are found: in the person of Christ Jesus. The fullest revelation of God's glorious riches is found in him alone. This is a stunning statement. God has revealed "the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Col. 1:27). Jesus is very God of very God, and all the riches and fullness of deity dwell bodily in him (Col. 2:8–9).

<span id="page-192-9"></span>This promise of God's extravagant generosity is grounded in the gospel of Christ. Paul explained this same point to the Corinthians in a call for sacrificial giving: "You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich" (2 Cor. 8:9). Indeed, the God "who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?" (Rom. 8:32).

<span id="page-192-5"></span><span id="page-192-2"></span><span id="page-192-1"></span>4:20 Paul closes not with a qualification but with a doxology: "To our God and Father be glory forever and ever." The goal of all that God does is his own glory. And God's goal has become Paul's passion: giving God praise and glory and credit and honor for all that he has done, forever. This same goal was the climax of the Christ hymn. The bowing of every knee and the confessing of every tongue that Jesus Christ is Lord will culminate in the final goal of "the glory of God the Father" (2:11).

<span id="page-192-6"></span><span id="page-192-4"></span><span id="page-192-3"></span>4:21 Paul greets the Philippians once again as people set apart ("saints") for God in Christ Jesus. Philippians 1:1 used the plural form "all the saints" to draw attention to the totality of the group as a collective whole, while this verse uses the singular "every saint" to emphasize Paul's affection for every individual Philippian believer. Paul expands the greeting to come also from "the brothers who are with me," which is probably a reference to Paul's co-laborers in Rome.

<span id="page-192-7"></span>4:22 The greeting now grows, so that it comes from all the saints in Rome. Paul calls attention to a specific group within the wider whole: "those of Caesar's household." A wealthy "household" in the ancient world would include a considerably large staff that served the family. Matthew Harmon helpfully notes that Caesar's household was "the ancient equivalent to a modern civil service, where experts in various areas helped to administrate the Roman Empire."74 Paul highlights this group to remind the Philippians that the gospel of Christ has conquered even the household of Caesar. The gospel continues to spread according to God's wise and powerful purposes, which include Paul's imprisonment in Rome.

<sup>74</sup> One estimate is that Caesar's household numbered close to 200,000 (Harmon, *Philippians*, 470).

<span id="page-193-6"></span>4:23 Paul closes each of his letters with a climactic note of grace.75 This grace is once again tied explicitly and exclusively to "the Lord Jesus Christ." Grace is God's undeserved and ill-deserved kindness to sinners that comes through Jesus, purchased by his death on the cross.76 Grace is so exclusively connected to Jesus in Paul's theology that being "severed from Christ" is equivalent to falling "away from grace" (Gal. 5:4).

### <span id="page-193-2"></span>*Response*

THE GRACE OF CHRIST, GENEROSITY, AND GOSPEL PARTNERSHIPS

<span id="page-193-1"></span>This passage connects gospel grace and financial generosity for gospel partnerships. It is important to note that grace and giving are theologically connected in the gospel. The grace of our Lord Jesus is his self-giving. Second Corinthians 8:9 is an amazing example: "You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich." The participle "being rich" could even be translated in a causal manner, which would stress further the tight connection between grace and self-giving: "*Because* he was rich, for your sake he became poor so that you by his poverty might become rich."77

Sam Houston (1793–1863) is a good example of someone who encountered this grace and was never the same. Houston was a colorful soldier and politician best known for his role in bringing Texas into the United States. He surprised everyone when he became a Christian. He surprised everyone even more when, after his baptism, he declared his desire to pay half of the local minister's salary. When someone asked him why, he responded, "My pocketbook was baptized, too." The conversion of our wallets should be included in our conversion to Christ. Gospel partnerships inevitably involve financial partnerships, for what we value most is making much of Christ and spreading his fame.

<span id="page-193-3"></span><span id="page-193-0"></span><sup>75</sup> The conclusion of Philippians uses the language of "your spirit," which is nearly identical to the way Paul closes Galatians (6:18) and Philemon (v. 25). Paul uses the pronoun "you" to close several other letters (Rom. 16:20; 1 Cor. 16:23; 2 Cor. 13:14; Col. 4:18; 1 Thess. 5:28; 2 Thess. 3:18; 1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:22; Titus 3:15). The phrase "your spirit" is equivalent to "you," with no distinction in meaning. Ephesians 6:24 spells out the "you" as "all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible."

<span id="page-193-5"></span><span id="page-193-4"></span><sup>76</sup> See the comment on Philippians 1:1 and especially the language borrowed from Harmon concerning "undeserved" and "ill-deserved."

## INTRODUCTION TO COLOSSIANS

### *Overview*

The letter to the Colossians presents itself as a letter of the apostle Paul (cf. Author, below). The letter addresses a Christian community that Paul did not found, a community threatened by false teaching that would draw them away from trust in Jesus Christ as he was presented to them in the gospel. Paul encourages the Colossians to remain true to what they have learned, laying before them a fresh presentation of the gospel. This gospel declares the salvation God has accomplished for his people by means of Christ's victory over sin and death and his lordship over all things.

### *Title*

The Greek title is "Pros Kolossaeis" (To the Colossians).

### *Author*

Paul is identified as the author of Colossians in the text of the letter, and there is no textual evidence to suggest that the letter ever circulated without Paul's name. Although Raymond E. Brown estimated in the mid-1990s that "about 60 percent of critical scholarship holds that Paul did not write the letter," this position is rather novel in the history of reading Colossians. Among the factors leading these scholars to believe that Paul did not write this letter are the letter's (1) distinctive vocabulary; (2) complex style; (3) developed theology; (4) references to false teaching that was similar to later developments; and (5) an idealized portrait of Paul.1 In discussing each of these reasons, Brown indicates fairly that there are significant counterarguments. Although Brown himself is cautiously inclined toward non-Pauline authorship,2 the position of Nijay Gupta, which acknowledges the weight of textual and historical testimony while also demonstrating intellectual humility, appears to be wiser:

Given the overwhelming support from Patristic testimony that Colossians was written by the Apostle Paul (or that he stands in some way as the source

<sup>1</sup> As summarized by Raymond E. Brown, *An Introduction to the New Testament*, ABRL (New York: Doubleday, 1997), 610–615.

<sup>2</sup> Ibid., 616.

behind the letter), and that no one problem of language, history, or theology is serious enough to undermine the putative authorial designation, we will proceed in this commentary by presuming Pauline authorship.3

Likewise I assume that Paul is the author of Colossians and will refer to the author as Paul without qualification.

<span id="page-198-2"></span>As in the letters to Philemon and the Philippians, Paul identifies Timothy as his companion and colleague. Paul should be regarded as the primary author of the letter, but the first-person plural forms of verbs in subsequent verses (e.g., 1:3, 4, 9) may suggest that Paul intended the letter to express the views of both himself and Timothy.

### *Date and Occasion*

If Paul did not write Colossians, it becomes impossible to determine the date and occasion of the letter with any precision, because all the historical references to people and places would then be taken as potentially fictional. Furthermore, there is no objective criterion by which the interpreter could decide which references, if any, were authentic and which were not. If we regard Paul as the author of the letter, however, we may assume that references in the text can guide us to a modest judgment as to the date and location of the letter.

In the absence of primary sources reflecting a view opposed by Paul (or by any other NT author), the viewpoint of an author's opponents may often nevertheless be reconstructed by viewing the warnings of the biblical author as a reflection of the views of the opponents. It is often not clear, however, whether a Christian community is actually facing a certain teaching or whether the biblical author is merely addressing a potential threat. It is also difficult to determine whether the biblical author addresses only one possible threat or several dangers at once. Thus caution is in order as we seek to determine the false teachings against which Colossians may have been written.

The various options for the place and date of writing for Colossians are discussed briefly in the *ESV Study Bible* and fully in the major commentaries.4 Here I can simply note my opinion that the most likely place of writing is Rome, at the time described in Acts 28. This would date the letter to approximately AD 62.

<span id="page-198-0"></span>Colossae was a city located in Asia Minor (roughly analogous to modern-day Turkey), approximately 100 miles (160 km) east of Ephesus. It had once been a prosperous city but was by the time of Paul rather less significant.5 According to the website of a Flinders University research project, "The area was renowned for its textiles and Colossae was particularly noted for its wool making and dyeing, especially the purple colour known as Colossinus drawn from cyclamen."6

### *Genre and Literary Features*

Colossians conforms to the general characteristics of ancient Hellenistic letters, except that, like all of Paul's letters other than perhaps Philemon, it is considerably longer and more developed than the noncanonical letters that have been preserved from ancient times.7 Paul's theological and pastoral concerns also mean that Colossians (like all of Paul's letters) stands out as distinctive among ancient letters. Furthermore, Colossians contains two significant sections that have a particular literary character of their own: the Christological "hymn" (1:15–20) and the "household code" (3:18–4:1).

### <span id="page-199-7"></span>*Theology of Colossians*

### THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

<span id="page-199-3"></span><span id="page-199-2"></span><span id="page-199-1"></span><span id="page-199-0"></span>The Christology of Colossians is particularly striking, not least because of the impressive Christological "hymn" in Colossians 1:15–20. Yet the presentation of Christ in Colossians is not significantly different from what Paul writes concerning Jesus Christ in his other canonical letters. We will address various issues as we come to them in the main body of the commentary, but here we simply note that Paul uses a range of terminology to describe Jesus, such as "Christ Jesus" (1:1), "our Lord Jesus Christ" (1:3), and "his beloved Son" (lit., "the Son of his love"; 1:13). Christ is further described as "the image of the invisible God" (1:15), "the firstborn of all creation" (1:15), and "the head of the body, the church" (1:18). Colossians does emphasize what we may describe as the "cosmic Christ," who created and sustains the universe and is the head of the one church of God. This does not oppose, however, a fully historical perspective of Jesus as the one who died on the cross and rose again (cf. 1:20; 2:6–15).

### <span id="page-199-5"></span><span id="page-199-4"></span>VICTORY OVER GOD'S ENEMIES

<span id="page-199-6"></span>Related closely to the theme of Christology, Colossians emphasizes God's victory over evil, particularly the work of Christ as the means of defeating the forces of spiritual darkness. The first clear statement of this theme is in 1:13, where the key actor is the Father, who rescues his people. This powerful act removes Christians from "the domain of darkness" and relocates them in "the kingdom of his beloved Son." A similar emphasis is found in 2:15, where the death of Christ on the cross, far from being a moment of defeat, is instead presented as an act of victory. Once again, the Father is the primary actor: "He [God] disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him." The victory of God in Christ is an important theme often neglected by those who fear it might be set against the view that Jesus' death on the cross achieves substitutionary atonement. But there is no reason these two facets of the work of Christ should be viewed as being opposed to each other. They are entirely complementary.

<sup>7</sup> Gustav Adolf Deissmann, *Light from the Ancient East* (1927; repr., Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1995)

### RECONCILIATION

Paul emphasizes how the alienation the Colossians once experienced had been overcome by the reconciliation God accomplished in Christ. This reconciliation is effective not only for human beings but also for creation and indeed for "all things" (1:20).

### <span id="page-200-10"></span>CHRIST AS THE TRUTH IN THE FACE OF COMPETING CLAIMS

<span id="page-200-11"></span>One of the most challenging aspects of the modern world is its vast array of ideas and philosophies. Colossians provides perspective on this reality by recognizing the presence of many truth claims (2:8) while pointing to Christ as the one in whom all human longing for knowledge and wisdom may be realized (1:19–20, 27; 2:9).

### <span id="page-200-9"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-200-8"></span><span id="page-200-0"></span>Paul draws deeply from the texts and overall narrative of the OT. This is particularly evident in the echoes of the creation narrative (1:15–17) and the possible reference to personified Wisdom as the craftsman in the act of creation (Proverbs 8). The language of "wisdom" is repeated in the letter, which suggests it is a key theme, possibly drawn from various texts in the Wisdom Literature of the OT.

There are very significant similarities between Colossians and Ephesians. Gupta provides the following list of passages that bear such similarities:

<span id="page-200-5"></span><span id="page-200-4"></span><span id="page-200-3"></span><span id="page-200-2"></span> Colossians 1:1–2 and Ephesians 1:1–2 Colossians 1:3–11 and Ephesians 1:3–18 Colossians 1:24–2:5 and Ephesians 3:1–13 Colossians 3:5–4:1 and Ephesians 4:17–6:9 Colossians 4:2–4 and Ephesians 6:18–20 Colossians 4:7–9 and Ephesians 6:21–22

<span id="page-200-7"></span><span id="page-200-6"></span>These similarities raise the question of whether there is a literary relationship between the two letters, although, as Gupta comments, "We are simply not in possession of enough evidence to make the claim that one text was based on the other."8 We will discuss the major similarities as they arise in the course of the commentary.

### *Preaching from Colossians*

<span id="page-200-1"></span>Preachers have various responsibilities as they proclaim God's Word to a congregation. Most urgently, they are responsible for answering the pressing question, "What must I do to be saved?" (Acts 16:30), presenting sinful human beings' critical need and God's gracious provision in Christ for that need. But preachers should also help the congregation to understand the broad sweep of God's purposes from creation through the fall and redemption to the new creation. This is what is often called "biblical theology." When preaching on a particular text, it is important to

show how the issues raised by that text fit into the larger narrative and theological framework of the whole Bible. The preacher declares the authoritative Word of God and calls for a response, trusting in the work of God's Spirit to enable the hearers to make such a response in faith and dependence on God. But another significant aspect of preaching is modeling to a congregation how they ought to read Scripture. And so there should be an element of education as well as proclamation in a sermon.

<span id="page-201-1"></span><span id="page-201-0"></span>One might preach from Colossians in a variety of ways. Some sections stand out as units, such as the "hymn" of 1:15–20 and the "household code" of 3:18–4:1, and so lend themselves to one-off sermons. These passages have been the focus of particular attention from preachers. Congregations must be helped to see how these sections function as units of text so that they are not simply mined for isolated statements. Several short sections of text, such as 1:13–14, 19–20; 2:13–15 and 3:1–4, are so rich in meaning that they may also demand a sermon dedicated to each one. But, in general, it is good for preachers and for congregations of Christians to read and preach through NT documents as whole compositions.

### <span id="page-201-2"></span>*Interpretive Challenges*

The precise nature of the false teaching, which was a threat to the Colossians in some way, remains particularly enigmatic. Gupta provides a helpful discussion that acknowledges the difficulties and uncertainties but suggests the description "transcendent-ascetic-philosophy."9 This description has the advantage of not linking the teaching to any known system of belief and of being descriptive of the issues raised by the text of Colossians. Gupta explains, "It is *transcendent* insofar as it seeks heavenly wisdom and spiritual perfection that transcends the supposed limitations of the body. It is *ascetic* because it seeks the subjugation of the weak body in order to be free from the dominion of troublesome spirits and powers."10 At points Paul uses terminology that may reflect the views and vocabulary of the false teachers, but since Paul is our only access to them, we cannot be certain.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-203-0"></span>1:1 Paul begins his letter to the Colossian believers with an introductory prescript. He fills this common epistolary form with rich theological statements; we should not regard his introductory remarks as routine or merely throwaway. The basic pattern is familiar to anyone who has read Paul's letters. The letter opens with Paul's name. In modern discussions regarding whether the canonical letters ascribed to Paul (including Colossians) are truly Pauline or are pseudepigraphical (falsely ascribed), the consistent testimony of the textual evidence is impressive and obstinate: all of our textual evidence includes the name of Paul as author. Paul describes himself in various ways in the four so-called "Captivity Letters" or "Prison Epistles" (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon), which appear to have been written at around the same time. In both Ephesians and Colossians Paul introduces himself as "an apostle of Christ Jesus." "Apostle" (meaning "one who is sent/commissioned") suggests both great dignity and great authority. In Philippians and Philemon, by contrast, Paul chooses descriptions communicating humility rather than authority ("servants," "prisoner"). Paul appears to select his self-descriptions according to the purpose and tone of his letter. We need not assume, however, that Paul's apostleship was being challenged in Colossae. Paul

<span id="page-204-3"></span>simply understood that he was appointed an apostle "by the will of God" (cf. Eph. 1:1), and, since he does not go on to defend his apostleship as he does in Galatians, we should not regard his use of the description here as defensive.

Timothy is mentioned along with Paul. For Timothy's role in the production of the letter, see the Introduction.

<span id="page-204-2"></span><span id="page-204-1"></span>Paul refers to Timothy as "our brother." (The Greek text reads "the brother," but the context allows the article to be understood with a possessive sense, emphasizing the relationship Paul and the Colossians share with Timothy.) In both Colossians and Philemon, Paul places particular emphasis on the relationship of "brother" or "brothers and sisters," using this term to describe a spiritual reality. Paul is convinced that God has adopted Christians into his family (Rom. 8:14, 23; 9:8; Gal. 4:5; Eph. 1:5) so that Christians become, by implication, brothers and sisters in the single family of God. But it also seems likely that Paul uses the term in certain circumstances for its rhetorical and pastoral significance. To describe fellow Christians as brothers and sisters highlights the family relationship that exists because of God's gracious and saving acts. Any difficult or delicate issues must be discussed and resolved in a manner appropriate to this relationship.

<span id="page-204-4"></span>1:2a Paul describes the Christians in Colossae with two adjectives, *hagiois* and *pistois*. There are several ways these words might be translated. If both are understood to modify the noun *adelphoi* ("brothers and sisters"), they might be rendered "holy" and either "faithful" or "believing." Thus Paul's address to the Colossians would read, "To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Colossae in Christ." Several translations, however (including the ESV), prefer to link the initial Greek article with the first adjective to form a substantive (an equivalent of a noun), and thus they translate the phrase, "to the saints in Colossae." This reading has the benefit of conforming to Paul's usage of *hagioi* in several other letters (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1; Phil. 1:1).11 It assumes a slightly disjointed grammar, however, where one Greek article relates to two adjectives in different ways (the first substantivally; the second combining with a noun and attributive adjective). Whichever reading is followed, Paul's intended meaning remain fundamentally the same.

<span id="page-204-0"></span>Paul describes the "location" of his fellow Christians using two parallel prepositional phrases with the Greek preposition *en* ("in"): "in Colossae" and "in Christ" (the ESV uses different English prepositions for the two phrases for stylistic reasons). The geographical location of the Colossian Christians clearly matters to them and allows them to be identified and distinguished from Christians in other places. Yet Paul considers their spiritual location to be more significant. It is because they are "in Christ"—united to him by faith—that they are in relationship with God and also with Paul and with believers in all places. Paul's use of this simple prepositional phrase ("in Christ") implies the remarkable theological

<sup>11</sup> See the discussion in Douglas J. Moo, *The Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon*, PNTC (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2008), 78n20.

reality known as "union with Christ." When a person becomes a Christian, he does not merely change some religious or philosophical view or adjust some pattern of behavior. Rather, a fundamental spiritual transformation takes place, which Paul will describe in more detail in chapters 2–3 of this letter.

<span id="page-205-4"></span><span id="page-205-2"></span>1:2b Paul's greeting ("Grace to you and peace") emphasizes God's unmerited favor toward human beings ("grace") and his *shalom*, which brings wholeness in a person's relationships with God, other people, and the whole of creation. These themes are developed further in the rest of the letter. Generally, this phrase is similar to greetings in Paul's other letters, except that grace and peace are said to come from "God our Father," with no reference to Jesus Christ. Of course, it is inconceivable that Paul intended by this omission to indicate a different theological understanding from what is expressed in the opening of Ephesians, Philippians, or Philemon. At the same time, it is unlikely that a careful thinker like Paul would simply drop a significant part of his typical greeting accidentally. Douglas Moo's explanation is reasonable: "Perhaps . . . Paul is preparing us for the unusual language of v. 3, in which he calls God *the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ*."12 We note there is no verb expressly stated in Paul's greeting. This leaves a measure of ambiguity as to whether Paul intends an indicative verb to be supplied ("grace and peace are yours") or whether he means to imply the optative mood, suggesting a wish or a prayer ("may grace and peace be yours").

### <span id="page-205-3"></span>*Response*

The language of family is very important in Paul's thought. Perhaps it sounds somewhat alien in individualistic Western society, but the language of family is still very important in parts of the world such as Africa, where community is more prominent. In the Xhosa language of South Africa, e.g., the standard way to address a stranger is in family terms: "Tata" (father), "Mama" (mother), "Bhuti" (brother) or "Sisi" (sister). But Paul has in mind more than a sociological notion of "Ubuntu" (the Xhosa idea that "a person is a person through other people") or the liberal notion of "the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man." Timothy is a brother to Paul and the Colossians because of their common experience of God's action in bringing about their salvation and inclusion among the heirs of God (Col. 1:12–14). Christians have experienced adoption (cf. Rom. 8:15–17; Gal. 4:5–7). Writing from the context of Africa, but recognizing the distinctive character of Paul's language, Solomon Andria writes,

<span id="page-205-1"></span><span id="page-205-0"></span>The fraternal ties between Paul and the Colossians are stronger than blood ties. They transcend ethnicity, race and social status. Paul and Timothy may be different from these brothers in many ways, but in Christ they form one family. And the same holds true for the relationships among the Colossian believers themselves. As "brothers," their primary identity is in Christ. It is

<sup>12</sup> Ibid., 79, emphasis his.

only secondarily that they are of the various origins and the different social classes that are found in any major city.13

Similarly, Mark Johnston notes how the theological reality of the family of God should have significance for the way in which the church deals with difficult issues among believers:

Church leaders and Christians generally would do well to take a leaf out of the apostle's handbook of pastoral care. Too often we can adopt an adversarial approach to the way we handle fellow-believers who have embraced unusual (or even deviant) teachings and practices, when instead we should do so in the spirit and with an attitude of those who are brothers.14

### *Comment*

<span id="page-207-3"></span>1:3 Paul is generally consistent in including a thanksgiving section in his letters, demonstrating a persistent attitude of thanksgiving.15 In almost every set of circumstances (the situation in Galatia being a notable exception), Paul finds reasons for thanksgiving. This was true even when he wrote to the dysfunctional church at Corinth (1 Cor. 1:4–9). Paul can maintain this thankful perspective because he gives thanks primarily for what God is accomplishing in the various Christian communities rather than for the attitudes and activities of the believers themselves.

<span id="page-207-2"></span><span id="page-207-0"></span>Paul's words in both the thanksgiving and the prayer sections are not directly addressed to God but are a *report* of thanksgiving and prayer offered to God on behalf of the Colossians.16 Paul reports that he gives thanks to "God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." Paul frequently adds theological qualifiers to his references to God, explicating who God is. For example, in Galatians 1:1 God is the one "who raised [Jesus] from the dead." God cannot be understood, according to Paul, apart from his self-revelation in Jesus Christ.

<span id="page-207-4"></span>1:4 What stimulates Paul's consistent prayer for the Colossians? Paul describes what he and his colleagues have *heard*. This suggests that he is not personally familiar with the situation in Colossae but nonetheless is deeply interested in the Colossians' welfare based on reports he has received. The reports have apparently been brought to Paul by Epaphras (cf. vv. 7–8).

<span id="page-207-5"></span><span id="page-207-1"></span>Paul summarizes the substance of what he has heard about the Colossians in terms of the familiar triad of faith, love, and hope (cf. 1 Cor. 13:13 and 1 Thess. 1:3).17 The believers' faith is "in Christ Jesus." The most natural reading of this

phrase here is that Jesus is the object of their faith. This fits well with Paul's parallel statement that he gives thanks for the love that the Colossians "have for all the saints." In that case, the saints are clearly the object of the Colossians' love. Likewise, Christ is the object of the Colossians' faith.

<span id="page-208-1"></span>1:5 The third element of the triad is hope. Hope is not to be understood here as a subjective experience on the part of the Colossian Christians. Rather, it is an objective reality "laid up for you in heaven." This hope, says Paul, is the reason for the faith and love shown by the Colossians. It is "because of" (*dia* + accusative case) this hope that they demonstrate the other virtues.18

These evidences of spiritual life that so encourage Paul are the result of the proclamation of "the word of truth, the gospel" (AT). How the various parts of this phrase should be connected is not clear. Very woodenly, the string of genitives could be read as "the word of the truth of the gospel," and various attempts have been made to do justice to both this grammar and its apparent sense. Although the grammar is not quite what one would expect for apposition,19 the ESV adopts the correct reading, treating "the gospel" as standing in apposition to "the word of the truth." Thus the word of truth is explained further as the true proclamation of God's saving acts in Jesus Christ. Support for this view comes from the very similar phrase in Ephesians 1:13, where the grammatical construction does follow the expected pattern.

<span id="page-208-2"></span><span id="page-208-0"></span>Paul explains that the Colossian believers heard about the hope that is the basis for their faith and love in the gospel. Paul links "hope" and "the gospel" twice in this chapter (1:5 and 1:23). This suggests, at least, a deliberate connection and possibly also an inclusio (a bracketing literary device) indicating the combination of hope and the gospel as a dominant motif for this section of the letter. According to BDAG, the term *elpis* ("hope") can refer to "the looking forward to something with some reason for confidence respecting fulfilment, *hope, expectation*," that is, the act of hoping; or "that which is the basis for hoping, *( foundation of ) hope*," or "that for which one hopes, *hope, something hoped for*."20 In this case, it is the final suggested definition that seems right (cf. J. B. Lightfoot, "The hope here is identified with the object of the hope").21

<span id="page-208-3"></span>Here Paul apparently has in mind an objective reality "laid up for you in heaven." Exactly what that reality might be is harder to say. Perhaps some help can be gained from a comparison with 1 Peter 1:3–4, where hope is spoken of as parallel to "an inheritance" that is "kept in heaven for you."22 Moo suggests that the phrase provided by BDAG (s.v. ἀπόκειμαι) is an appropriate definition: "the

<span id="page-209-11"></span><span id="page-209-9"></span>totality of blessings that awaits the Christian in the life to come."23 This would tie in closely with the notion of the objective hope being an inheritance (as in 1 Pet. 1:3–4). I am sympathetic to this suggestion, but I think there may be more of a focus on the personal presence of Jesus in heaven. The only references in the letter to what the Colossians have in heaven are here in Colossians 1:5 (a "hope") and also in 4:1 (a "Lord" or "Master"). Furthermore, in 3:1–4 Paul speaks of Christ as being "above, . . . seated at the right hand of God," and of the believer's life as "hidden with Christ in God." Indeed, Paul can say to the Colossians that Christ is "your life" (3:3). So the focus of the believers' attention is Christ rather than the benefits he brings, although the benefits of what Christ has accomplished are clearly implied also.

<span id="page-209-10"></span><span id="page-209-5"></span><span id="page-209-3"></span><span id="page-209-2"></span><span id="page-209-1"></span><span id="page-209-0"></span>"The gospel" is a central term and concept for Paul. He frequently assumes his readers are already familiar with the content of the gospel (doubtless because he or his colleagues had already made it clear in person; cf. Col. 1:6–7). There are, however, a number of places in Paul's letters where he offers a concise summary of the gospel. Perhaps the most significant of these is 1 Corinthians 15:1–5. Paul's introductory remarks in that section of 1 Corinthians emphasize the foundational nature of the gospel. In particular, Paul highlights that this gospel was what he had preached to the Corinthians, what they had received (using the language of transmission of tradition; cf. 1 Cor. 15:3), and on which they had taken their stand (1 Cor. 15:1). He also indicates that it is the means by which they are saved, provided they continue to hold to it. In 1 Corinthians 15:3–5 Paul provides a very carefully shaped statement focusing on Jesus' death, burial, resurrection, and postresurrection appearances to the disciples. The composition takes the form of two couplets, each of which contains the phrase "in accordance with the Scriptures." Finally, Christ's death is given further theological interpretation by the phrase "for our sins" (1 Cor. 15:3). So we can say that, for Paul, the gospel was the proclamation of the historical events of Jesus' life, with particular reference to the events of his death, burial, resurrection, and appearances prior to his ascension. All of these events were to be understood in the context of the entire narrative of the Hebrew Scriptures and with particular emphasis on the effect of Christ's death on our sins.

<span id="page-209-8"></span><span id="page-209-7"></span><span id="page-209-6"></span>In the context of Colossians, we find Paul making several references to what God has accomplished in Christ. We might draw attention to Colossians 1:13–14, 22, and 2:11–15 in particular. Paul does not specifically refer to these statements as "the gospel" (although he does make reference to "the gospel" in 1:23). However, they seem to be summary statements (similar to 1 Cor. 15:3–5) encapsulating God's saving activity in Christ. So we may suggest that they also reflect what Paul has in mind when he speaks of "the gospel" (Col. 1:5).

<span id="page-209-4"></span>1:6 Paul demonstrates both a local interest and a global perspective. He notes that the gospel "has come to you," that is, to the community of Colossae. Although the participial form he uses (*tou parontos*) might be interpreted as indicating presence, the combination of the participle with the preposition *eis* ("to" or "into") suggests entrance. The gospel has entered into the lives of the Colossians. But Paul sets that local reference in the context of the growth of the gospel throughout the whole world. When Paul speaks of "the whole world," we should probably understand it as a reference to the known world of the Roman Empire, situated largely around the Mediterranean Sea. Paul is not concerned solely for what happens in one particular community—he is concerned equally that the gospel has its full impact internationally.

<span id="page-210-5"></span><span id="page-210-0"></span>This gospel, says Paul, is "bearing fruit and increasing." This phrase draws attention to the "organic" nature of Christian life. The distinctive terminology Paul uses here occurs again in verse 10, although in a somewhat different way. Both verses combine participial forms of the verbs *karpophoreō* (to bear fruit) and *auxanō* (to increase). Several commentators have suggested that this is a possible echo of Genesis 1:28, since the latter verb is used in the Greek (Septuagint) rendering of that verse. Some scholars have questioned this connection, noting that the former verb is not employed in the Greek version of Genesis 1:28. Others have asked whether Paul's readers would have picked up on his allusion. This latter question does not appear to be particularly significant, in this case at least. We can say with some confidence that the repetition of these two verbs is not accidental. Paul shows that he intended to link the verbs by doing so twice. We can also say that whether or not Paul's readers knew the Scriptures well enough to pick up its echoes, Paul certainly did. Thus, this phrase is a scriptural image of organic life, growth, and productivity used by Paul as a fresh means of presenting the spiritual life and growth that the gospel brings.

It is the gospel, the message of God's saving act in Christ, that is bearing fruit and growing in this way. Paul effectively personifies the gospel, giving it the characteristics of an active agent. The implication is that God is working through the gospel to bring about effective results—what Paul describes as "the grace of God in truth" (Col. 1:6b). There is perhaps an echo of Jesus' parable of the sower/soils (Mark 4) in Paul's reference to the message bearing fruit,24 for the verb *karpophoreō* is used also in Mark 4:20 to describe those who receive the word and "bear fruit."

<span id="page-210-3"></span><span id="page-210-2"></span><span id="page-210-1"></span>This true message of God's grace began to have its effect from the very first day it entered Colossae and was understood. Paul will next make reference to the means by which both the gospel and the news of its effect have traveled: Epaphras.

<span id="page-210-6"></span><span id="page-210-4"></span>1:7 Epaphras is introduced as one of Paul's valued colleagues. Paul does not hesitate to describe him in glowing terms (cf. also Col. 4:12 and Philem. 23). He is a "beloved fellow servant" and a "faithful minister of Christ." These descriptions speak both of deep affection on the part of Paul and of recognition of significant Christian service. Epaphras was the one who had taught the Colossians the gospel. His faithful service on their behalf is seen primarily in his commitment to the task of teaching the gospel faithfully so they could know it. But it is also seen in his

apparent delight in sharing with Paul the report of how the gospel was bearing fruit and growing among the Colossians.

<span id="page-211-3"></span>1:8 In particular, Epaphras has spoken of their "love in the Spirit." Among all the things Epaphras could have mentioned concerning the Colossians, he chooses to focus on their love. This displays his loyalty toward them and his own love for the brothers and sisters in Colossae. But this comment also tells us something about Paul's attitude. Paul will address concerns about the well-being of the Colossians in due course. At this point, however, he highlights the reports he has heard of the love evident in Colossae.

<span id="page-211-7"></span><span id="page-211-6"></span><span id="page-211-4"></span><span id="page-211-2"></span>1:9 Having delighted in God's work among the Colossians as the gospel was "bearing fruit and increasing" (v. 6), Paul now prays that God would provide the fullest experience of his grace for them. Paul was prompted to pray "from the day we heard." This rather awkward Greek construction doubtless refers to the day when Paul received a report about the Colossians from Epaphras. In response to this report, which we have already learned was largely positive, Paul immediately prays for fullness of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. (In fact, he states that he has not ceased praying and making requests.) These and similar terms will recur throughout the letter (cf., e.g., 1:9, 10; 2:2, 3; 3:10 [knowledge]; 1:9, 28; 2:3, 23; 3:16; 4:5 [wisdom]; 2:2 [understanding]). Paul appears to have a particular concern for how believers *think*. "Knowledge of his will" is something that God alone can give, and he has done so in the Scriptures. Paul is, therefore, able to pray with confidence because the Colossians may gain access to God's will by reading the Scriptures. Yet Paul also recognizes that more than knowledge is required. He desires for them to have "spiritual wisdom and understanding." The adjective "spiritual" should not be interpreted vaguely as a synonym of "religious" but rather as a reference to the activity of the Spirit of God. What the Colossians need above all is God's own Spirit at work to turn the knowledge they can find in the Scriptures into true "wisdom" (applied knowledge; "wisdom that God imparts to those who are close to God")25 and "understanding" (comprehension of God's purposes; "understanding such as God grants to God's own").26

<span id="page-211-5"></span><span id="page-211-1"></span><span id="page-211-0"></span>1:10 The knowledge Paul seeks for the Colossians is not for the sake of puffing them up (cf. 1 Cor. 8:1). Rather, his desire (expressed with an infinitive of purpose/ result) is that they might "walk" in a manner worthy of the Lord. Paul uses the OT metaphor of walking to speak of a way of life (cf. Psalm 1).27 Paul desires the Colossians to live their lives in a manner that reflects the character of their Lord and pleases him. As Moo notes, this emphasis on Christ is "yet another example of the very high Christology that typifies this letter."28

<sup>25</sup> BDAG, s.v. σοφία.

<sup>26</sup> BDAG, s.v. σύνεσις.

<sup>27</sup> BDAG, s.v. περιπατέω. This language is also found in other Jewish literature. The rabbinic term for instruction on correct behavior is *halakhah*, which is derived from the verb *halak*, "to walk." 28 Moo, *Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon*, 96.

<span id="page-212-3"></span>Paul further explains what will be characteristic of such a life by returning to the language of organic growth that he used in the thanksgiving section (Col. 1:6). Here, however, the same vocabulary is used with a different subject. In verse 6 it was the gospel that was bearing fruit and growing. Now in verse 10 it is the Colossian believers whom Paul longs to see bearing fruit and increasing. In this case the two key terms are linked to two separate phrases in the dative case. The result is two parallel phrases: "bearing fruit in every good work" and "increasing in the knowledge of God." In this way, Paul again draws attention to the importance of both behavior and belief in the Christian life.

<span id="page-212-5"></span>1:11 Paul now indicates that he prays for strength and power. Such passages have sometimes been misunderstood to suggest that a Christian will have a life of overwhelming victory. It is true that God does supply strength and power, but these resources are supplied so that a Christian might live with "all endurance and patience with joy." Paul envisages the strength needed to face adversity and challenge over the long haul. Yet he also prays for the believers' lives to be characterized by joy. The prepositional phrase *meta charas* ("with joy," "joyfully"), may be read with what precedes ("endurance and patience") or with what follows in verse 12 ("giving thanks"), although it is perhaps more likely that it modifies the following participle (cf. ESV mg.), in line with other participles in verses 10–11).29

<span id="page-212-6"></span><span id="page-212-4"></span>1:12 Finally, Paul indicates that he prays for the Colossians to have a thankful attitude. The present participle appears to have the sense of an imperative, implying an instruction to "give thanks." That this forms part of Paul's prayer makes clear that gratitude does not come naturally to fallen human beings. Believers must pray for God to enable them to demonstrate thankfulness. But Paul also now points to the way in which a thankful attitude may be cultivated as he recounts the remarkable acts of grace the Father has enacted on behalf of his people.

### *Response*

<span id="page-212-8"></span><span id="page-212-7"></span><span id="page-212-2"></span><span id="page-212-1"></span><span id="page-212-0"></span>Paul's emphasis on thanksgiving is one the church should learn from and adopt. This terminology of thanksgiving appears throughout the letter (the verb *eucharisteō*, Col. 1:3, 12; 3:17; the noun *eucharistia*, 2:7; 4:2; and the only NT example of the adjective *eucharistos*, 3:15). These references indicate an important theme in a relatively short letter. Yet it is not simply Paul's *attitude* that is significant; *what* he delights in is significant as well. Two features seem instructive for modern Christians. First, Paul rejoices in the growth of the gospel. Paul is consistently gospel-oriented. His priority is that the gospel, the true word, might be declared and might therefore bring life and growth. For this reason he mentions Epaphras, who declared the gospel faithfully to the Colossians. The gospel is the power of God for the salvation of those who believe (Rom. 1:16), but there must be someone to proclaim that gospel faithfully and fearlessly (Rom 10:14–15; cf. Isa. 52:7).

<span id="page-213-2"></span>Second, Paul delights in the good that he hears about the Colossians. This is not to say that Paul is naive and closes his ears to any reports that might give cause for concern, as can be seen from subsequent portions of the letter. Nonetheless, Paul does not delight in such matters. He makes no mention of negative issues in his thanksgiving, or even in his prayer. Instead he delights in the reports of the evidence of the gospel's impact on the lives of his Christian brothers and sisters. Once again, Epaphras is significant in this respect, as Paul identifies him as the one who "has made known to us your love in the Spirit" (Col. 1:8). When destructive gossip can be such a malignant influence within the Christian church, how good it is to find someone who "rejoices with the truth" and "hopes all things" (1 Cor. 13:6–7). May there be more and more people in our churches like Epaphras: people who, because the gospel is bearing fruit and growing in their lives, declare the gospel to others faithfully and highlight the best news they can about other Christians when they speak to others about them.

<span id="page-213-0"></span>Christians today may also learn from Paul's interest in the growth of the church in all places. The Christian church is now truly a global church. Modern technology has enabled Christians everywhere to be aware of how the gospel is "bearing fruit and increasing" in other parts of the world. It requires both determination and humility, however, to be well informed about what is happening in other parts of the world. We must choose to learn from Christian brothers and sisters in other places. It is particularly important for those in the Western church to be aware of the astonishing growth of the church in the rest of the world. Timothy Tennent comments,

I believe that there is a growing realization that the Majority [Third] World church may play a crucial role, not only in revitalizing the life of Western Christianity, but in actually contributing positively and maturely to our own theological reflection. The day of regarding the theological reflections of the Majority World church as something exotic or ancillary, or as the object of study only for a missionary or area specialist, is now over.30

But it is also the case that Christians in the rest of the world can and should benefit from relationships with Christians in the West. Any sense of superiority is unacceptable among Christian brothers and sisters, regardless of where they live. As Christians around the globe seek to be more aware of each other and to learn from each other, the principle Paul emphasized to the Philippians applies to all: "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others" (Phil. 2:3–4). The mission of the church is now "from everywhere to everyone." Christians must be creative and gracious in finding ways to cooperate in the task of sharing the gospel.

<span id="page-213-1"></span>Paul desires growth and fruitfulness in the areas of "knowledge" and "spiritual wisdom and understanding" on one hand and "good works" on the other

<sup>30</sup> Timothy C. Tennent, *Theology in the Context of World Christianity: How the Global Church Is Influencing the Way We Think about and Discuss Theology* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2007), 13.

<span id="page-214-4"></span><span id="page-214-3"></span>(cf. particularly Col. 1:9–10). He is concerned about what believers both think and do. And rightly so, since the way a person thinks will have huge significance for the way he acts. Paul places great importance on how Christians think. When he calls for faithful and humble service within the church at Philippi, he calls the believers there to "have [the same] mind" as Christ (Phil. 2:5). There is no benefit in having an outward morality that is corrupted by false understanding of God, and there is little hope of real moral transformation unless there is a deep understanding of the character and actions of God.

<span id="page-214-1"></span><span id="page-214-0"></span>Thankfulness is a recurring theme in Colossians, and Paul makes clear that it should be a distinguishing mark of all Christians. It is a foundational principle in the Scriptures, and particularly in the Psalms, that God's people should "Give thanks to the Lord" because "he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!" (Pss. 107:1; 118:1; 136:1). In fact, the more Christians allow Scripture to shape our attitudes and our prayers, the more we can expect thanksgiving to become a natural part of our lives. Thankfulness is also evidence that a person is in a living reality of union with Christ. As a believer is drawn into realization that he has been raised with Christ and that his life is now hidden with Christ in God (Col. 3:1–4), he will grasp the extent of God's love (cf. Eph. 3:18–19) and will be moved to thankfulness. The reality of union with Christ will also be seen as the mind of Christ (Phil. 2:5), who was consistently thankful to his Father, becomes increasingly evident in the life of the Christian.

<span id="page-214-6"></span><span id="page-214-2"></span>Paul's prayer that God might enable the Colossians to persevere is a timely reminder that the call to discipleship is a call to endurance. Many churches around the world are influenced and afflicted by the so-called prosperity gospel. This teaching promises health and wealth for those who believe (enough!) in Jesus. Christian teachers and preachers must, therefore, draw attention to the examples of faithful believers who experienced hardship, poverty, and exclusion—an example seen most poignantly in the Lord Jesus Christ himself.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-214-5"></span>Paul has called the Colossians to be thankful to the Father, who has acted on their behalf and has given them a portion "in the inheritance of the saints in light" (1:12). The apostle goes on to explain the nature of the Father's gracious, saving actions more fully, with particular reference to the role of Christ. He thus provides a compact summary of the gospel, referred to earlier in the letter. This section functions as a distinct summary of God's saving acts and as a natural transition between the preceding section of thanksgiving and prayer and the following Christological "hymn" of 1:15–20.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-215-5"></span><span id="page-215-3"></span>1:13 The gospel is the proclamation of what God has achieved for his people. Paul has spoken of "the gospel" previously (1:5). Now, although he does not explicitly use this term in this section of his letter, he nevertheless provides a brief description of God's saving activity. His words put the primary emphasis on God's sovereign work of grace and mercy in the person of his Son, Jesus Christ. Of course, to emphasize the action of God is in no way to minimize the importance of human response to that action. People are invited, indeed commanded, to "repent and believe in the gospel" (Mark 1:15). But the gospel is primarily the declaration that God has demonstrated his kingly power and grace in accomplishing salvation for his people and overcoming his enemy—the declaration, in Isaiah's words, that "your God reigns" (Isa. 52:7). This sovereign act leads to being transferred to a new kingdom under a benevolent reign that entails peace, happiness, and salvation for God's people.

<span id="page-215-4"></span><span id="page-215-2"></span><span id="page-215-1"></span>Paul makes clear that the Father is the initiator of the rescue of helpless human beings. Verse 13 opens with a masculine relative pronoun referring back to the Father in verse 12. The Father has already been described in verse 12 as the one who has qualified his people to share in his inheritance (thus implying a new family status). Now Paul offers further clarification of how the Father has acted toward his people. First, the Father has "delivered us." According to BDAG, the verb *rhuomai* means "to rescue from danger, *save, rescue, deliver, preserve*."31 Moo notes the linguistic connections between this passage and Exodus 6:6–8, which speaks of God's rescuing and redeeming his people from captivity and bringing them into the Promised Land as their possession or inheritance. Moo points out, however, that there are also similar possible connections with texts from the Psalms and Isaiah that speak of return from exile, a "new exodus."32

<span id="page-215-0"></span>The themes are interrelated, and both are important. Therefore, it may not be possible to identify which particular text stands behind Paul's thought here. Numerous texts in the OT demonstrate that God is a God who rescues his people. In this narrative, the captive is "us." This first-person pronoun marks a change from the second-person "you" that is used in the preceding verses. It may include

<sup>31</sup> BDAG, s.v. ρ῾ύομαι, italics original.

<sup>32</sup> Moo, *Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon*, 106.

the Colossian Christians, Paul and Timothy, and the wider Christian community. All alike required, and have experienced, God's gracious rescue. If Paul's language recalls the experience of the people of Israel, it is striking that now the deliverance is experienced by a community that includes both Jews and Gentiles.

<span id="page-216-4"></span>The two situations Paul describes, before and after God's act of deliverance, stand in stark contrast to each other. The Colossians were once in the "domain of darkness" but are now in the "kingdom of his beloved Son." The word "kingdom" (*basileia*) is relatively rare in Paul's writings, despite its being a key term in the teaching of Jesus. Nonetheless, it does occur on occasion in Paul's letters, including two occurrences in Colossians (here and 4:11). These references bear testimony both to the continuity between the teachings of Jesus and Paul33 and to the freedom the early church felt to express the gospel in terms that were not simply reproductions of Jesus' words. The term *basileia* has been discussed at length. In particular, there is debate about whether it refers to a "realm" or to a "reign." The consensus in recent scholarship is that there are aspects of both in the word, although the sense of active reign predominates in the Gospels.34

<span id="page-216-0"></span>A similar range of meanings is associated with the word *exousia* ("domain"). In this case, it seems clear that the Colossians have moved from one context to another without any physical relocation, and so we should understand both terms as referring to "the sphere in which power is exercised."35 The new domain in which believers find themselves as a result of God's mighty act is the kingdom of his "beloved Son." This beautiful description of relationship and love (cf. the accounts of Jesus' baptism in Matt. 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22) is dramatically different from the previous situation in "the domain of darkness." Noting the parallel nature of the descriptions, we should probably read "darkness" as a personification of that which battles against the light—the Evil One, who controls all those in his domain in such a way that people are held in captivity. As a result of the saving act of God in Christ, however, those who once were trapped have now been rescued.

<span id="page-216-2"></span><span id="page-216-1"></span>1:14 Reference to the Son leads Paul to reflect on the result of this rescue for Christians. There is a striking similarity between this verse and Ephesians 1:7. The wording is almost identical except that the words used for sin are different and the text in Ephesians includes two prepositional phrases expanding Paul's thought (table 3.1).

First, Paul connects his thought here to his prior reference to the Son with the prepositional phrase "in whom" (*en hō*). Paul frequently describes Christians as being "in Christ."36 Christians do not simply accept factual propositions about Christ but have entered into the most intimate relationship with him by faith, to the extent of being united to him. This is expressed in several places throughout Colossians (e.g., 2:13; 3:1–4).

TABLE 3.1: Similarities between Colossians 1:14 and Ephesians 1:7

Second, Paul declares that, in the Son, Christians (Paul again uses the inclusive first-person plural form "we") have "redemption, the forgiveness of sins." Paul shifts from the aorist tense to the present indicative "we have" (*echomen*). He thus offers two perspectives on the same reality: in verse 13 Paul describes salvation in its entirety; in verse 14 he describes the ongoing personal experience of Christians. The nature of this experience is described by the term "redemption," followed by the phrase "the forgiveness of sins" to provide further clarification; these are not two experiences but one.

<span id="page-217-5"></span><span id="page-217-4"></span><span id="page-217-0"></span>The language of "redemption" (*apolytrōsin*) picks up the reference to God's rescue in verse 13 and "points to the exodus traditions as well as to the new exodus in Isaiah."37 The word speaks of freedom achieved on behalf of one who was enslaved. But how does "the forgiveness of sins" relate to, and indeed explain, the theme of redemption? Paul uses the language of forgiveness of sins in connection with the work of Christ mainly in Colossians and Ephesians (Col. 1:14; 2:13; 3:13; Eph. 1:7; 4:32).38 David Pao comments, "This phrase points again to the new exodus tradition in Isaiah, where the word 'forgiveness,' also translated as 'release,' characterizes God's eschatological deliverance of his people (Isa. 58:6; 61:1–2)."39 While the language of forgiveness of sins is sometimes used in connection with justification (cf. Rom. 4:7–8), the emphasis here appears to be on God's act of releasing believers from the power of their own sinful choices that have enslaved them in the past. The result is an ongoing experience of freedom because the Son, in whom they are now found, has achieved that freedom for them through the cross (cf. Col. 2:13–15).

The gospel is the declaration of what God has done in Christ and how his work transforms human experience. Testimony of God's gracious care and provision in the life of a believer is a valuable contribution to the task of presenting Jesus to the world. Christians should be careful to maintain an appropriate balance, as Paul does, between proclaiming the saving actions of God and delighting in the experience of freedom those actions have provided.

Christians must understand that they have been transferred from one domain to another. A fundamental spiritual transformation and relocation has taken place in their lives, whether or not they are conscious of it at any given time. They are

<sup>39</sup> Pao, *Colossians and Philemon*, 78.

not wavering between two domains, some days in one, some in another. They have been rescued and are under new authority.

Paul presents the definitive work of God as a rescue mission in which Christians have been delivered from hostile forces. The notion of needing rescue from the dominion of darkness may seem strange to Western readers. Yet people throughout the world find themselves enslaved in destructive behavior, such as the use of drugs or pornography, and are unable to escape on their own. They might not recognize the activity of evil and destructive spiritual beings, but the imprisonment is real nonetheless. In some parts of the world, however, such as much of Africa, there remains a distinct awareness of the realities of malevolent spiritual forces. In fact, openness to the reality of such beings can be problematic. People grow up with a fear of what the "ancestors" may do in their lives if they do not appease them by showing due respect in various important ceremonies and regular sacrifices. This can be a major problem even for those who have become Christians and confess Jesus as Lord. It is very important for Christians in regions where awareness of spiritual beings and realities is heightened to be very aware of Paul's declaration of definitive rescue in Colossians.

The objective nature of both the Christian gospel and the Christian's spiritual location as presented in Scripture are anchor-points when a believer's feelings and circumstances cause uncertainty and doubt. But believers should also reflect on their personal experience of the objective victory that Christ has achieved. They know "redemption, the forgiveness of sins," not simply at the moment of conversion, as if they must then manage as best they can on their own. Rather, believers' union with Christ means that every moment of their lives from the time of conversion is one in which they experience the full significance of Christ's completed work. It is essential that the objective and subjective aspects of redemption are not separated but are seen as part of an indivisible whole.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-219-0"></span>Paul dwells on his reference to the Father's "beloved Son" (Col. 1:13) and reflects on who Jesus is and what he has done in a stunning passage that is both beautiful and balanced, creative and controlled. Paul emphasizes the Son's sovereignty and headship over creation and the church.

### *Section Outline*

	- A. The Son over All Creation (1:15–17)
	- B. The Son over the Church (1:18–20)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-219-2"></span>1:15–20 This passage is often described as a "hymn" because it appears to reflect the confession and worship of the church and because it clearly has been crafted with some care. Some commentators have argued that, while all these observations are true, we should be careful not to rush too quickly to use the term "hymn." To use this term, they argue, seems to imply a work of poetry intended to be sung, and it is not at all clear that such is the nature of this passage.40 Pao argues, however, that the term "hymn" is appropriate if understood in its literary context. Many scholars have also claimed that this text is "tradition." By this they mean that Paul has adopted material already in circulation and incorporated it into his letter. Once again, we should be cautious about this view. The supposed prior history of this text is entirely conjectural. Regardless of any possible history of the text or certain parts of it, we can say that it is now fully integrated into its context and so expresses just what Paul intended to say. Whether others had a hand in shaping the passage at an earlier stage is irrelevant. It is Paul's thought now, and all that we know of the richness of Paul's theological thought leads us to conclude that he is entirely capable of producing such a glorious passage of praise.41

<span id="page-219-5"></span><span id="page-219-4"></span><span id="page-219-1"></span>This passage is carefully constructed, characterized by general balance across two sections and by repetition of key terms and phrases. We will summarize a number of these features here. First, the passage begins in verse 15 with the nominative masculine singular relative pronoun (*hos*). This particular form is repeated in verse 18. These two verses mark the beginning of two sections, roughly similar in length, that have some thematic coherence. Three instances of the nominative masculine singular personal pronoun (*autos*) occur in verses 17 and 18. Forms of this personal pronoun, in three different prepositional phrases, occur in verses 16 and 17 and then again in verses 19 and 20. The repetition of the important term *prōtotokos* ("firstborn") in verse 15 and in verse 18 is likewise a significant marker of the two sections. In the first part of the passage, the *ktis-* root (create/creation) is repeated three times in verses 15 and 16. We also see repetition of the adjective *pas* ("all"), particularly its substantival form, *ta panta* ("all things"), in verses 16

<sup>41</sup> Cf. ibid., 90–91.

<span id="page-220-9"></span>and 17 and again in verse 20. These features are visible when the two sections of the passage are laid side by side and some of the features of the Greek text are highlighted (table 3.2).

All of these features justify the description of this passage as "exalted prose" (or "hymn," used cautiously). Paul is so captivated by the wonder of the person and work of Jesus that the expressions of his thought in writing are raised to new heights.

<span id="page-220-7"></span><span id="page-220-5"></span><span id="page-220-1"></span>1:15 The initial relative pronoun refers to "the Son" mentioned in verse 13. It points, therefore, to a different "he" than the same relative pronoun at the beginning of verse 13 does, the antecedent of which was God the Father. The Son is described as the "image" (*eikōn*) of God, immediately followed by a further description: "firstborn of all creation." The phrase *eikōn tou theou* ("image of God") recalls the language of Genesis 1:26–27 (cf. also Gen. 5:1; 9:6). The phrase *prōtotokos pasēs ktiseōs* ("firstborn of all creation") is infamously highlighted by Jehovah's Witnesses and others with Arian sympathies who claim that it teaches that Christ is the first and greatest of all God's creatures. While it is true that the phrase is somewhat enigmatic, the most fundamental principle of biblical interpretation demands that it be understood in the context of the whole of Scripture. Following this principle leaves the Arian interpretation untenable. A particularly important text for understanding this difficult phrase is Psalm 89:27: "I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth." This verse appears in a section of the psalm speaking of Yahweh's covenant with David. It is perfectly clear from the biblical accounts of David that he was not physically the firstborn of his family. In fact, he was the youngest of his brothers. This demonstrates that the term "firstborn" may be used in a figurative manner. Further, the term "firstborn" is qualified with the phrase, "the highest of the kings of the earth." This indicates that, in the context of Psalm 89, to be made "firstborn" by God means to be exalted to the highest place. Such a reading of "firstborn" makes perfect sense in the context of Colossians 1.

<span id="page-220-8"></span><span id="page-220-6"></span><span id="page-220-4"></span><span id="page-220-3"></span><span id="page-220-2"></span>1:16 Paul now explains the Son's exalted status over all creation (beginning with *hoti*, "because"). The first explanation is that all things were created, in Greek, *en autō*. As in verse 14, this prepositional phrase might legitimately be translated as either "in him" or "by him." In this context, the phrase should probably be treated as instrumental ("by him"), showing that the Son is the agent by whom the creator God brought all things into existence (cf. John 1:3).

<span id="page-221-4"></span><span id="page-221-3"></span><span id="page-221-0"></span>How should we understand *ta panta* ("all things") in this passage? The phrase is used several times in this passage, and in most cases it seems fairly clear that it should be read as an all-inclusive term. "All things" are created by the Son (v. 16). This is then unpacked by paired phrases making the sense as inclusive as possible (v. 16b). The Son has created all things in heaven as well as on earth, visible as well as invisible. He has created all authorities and powers (understood to be "cosmic" or "angelic" beings and powers.42 Likewise, according to verse 17, he is "before all things," and in him "all things hold together." It is inconceivable that Paul would suggest that any aspect of creation existed *before* the Son or that any aspect of it is self-sustaining apart from him. All of this is fairly uncontroversial. The difficulty arises when exactly the same phrase is used in the second part of the passage (v. 20). There God is said "to reconcile to himself all things" through the Son and to make peace through the blood of his cross. Does this text teach universal reconciliation, universal peace with God? In other words, does it teach universalism? We will come back to this shortly, in the Response section below.

<span id="page-221-6"></span>All things were created not only by the Son but also "through him" and "for him" (*di' autou* and *eis auton*). These two prepositional phrases communicate significant ideas in extremely condensed form. *Dia* followed by the genitive case indicates agency or means.43 The most natural reading is that the Son is the active agent of creation. Wallace suggests eight possible uses of *eis* followed by the accusative.44 In this case, the construction should be read as indicating advantage ("for him").

1:17 What is more, he is "before all things," and "in him all things hold together." "Before all things" might be read in a temporal sense (meaning prior to all things) or a hierarchical one (meaning superior to all things). The temporal sense seems to be implied by the declaration that the Son is the one who created all things. The repeated use of the term "firstborn," however, when understood in light of OT usage, suggests the primacy of the Son's importance is being emphasized. The statement that in the Son "all things hold together" is paralleled in thought in Hebrews 1:3.

<span id="page-221-7"></span><span id="page-221-5"></span><span id="page-221-2"></span>Verses 17 and 18a of Colossians 1 form a transitional section in the passage. Both verses begin with the phrase "And he is" (*kai autos estin*), using the third-person personal pronoun rather than the relative pronoun used in verse 15. These verses mark a shift of theme from the Son's relationship to creation to his relationship to the church. This close connection may imply that Paul regards the church as the new creation. (Compare 2 Cor. 5:17 and Gal. 6:15, where Paul speaks of the experience of being in Christ as "new creation.")

<span id="page-221-1"></span><sup>42</sup> Cf. Peter T. O'Brien, *Colossians–Philemon*, WBC (Waco, TX: Word, 1982), 46–47.

<sup>43</sup> Cf. Daniel B. Wallace, *Greek Grammar beyond the Basics* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1996), 368–369. 44 Cf. ibid., 369.

<span id="page-222-3"></span><span id="page-222-1"></span>1:18 Paul's description of the Son as the head of the body is very similar to his description of Christ elsewhere (cf. esp. 1 Corinthians 12). The significance of the metaphor of the body is made explicit by the articular noun standing in apposition to "the body," thus explaining that the body is "the church." Of the four occurrences of the term *ekklēsia* in Colossians (1:18, 24; 4:15, 16), the first two refer to what we might call the "universal church," that is, the single church composed of all believers throughout all ages. The latter two, on the other hand, refer to local expressions of the church: the church that meets in Nympha's home and the church of the Laodiceans. This is somewhat different from Ephesians, where all nine references to the *ekklēsia* are to the universal church. Paul apparently was quite content to recognize a breadth of meaning in the word.45

<span id="page-222-4"></span><span id="page-222-2"></span>Verse 18b completes the transition by using the relative pronoun *hos* ("who" or "he") in a manner parallel to verse 15 and by repeating the use of *prōtotokos* ("firstborn"), so that "he is the image of the invisible God, . . . firstborn of all creation" (*hos estin eikōn tou theou tou aoratou, prōtotokos pasēs ktiseōs*; v. 15) is complemented by "he is the beginning, . . . firstborn from the dead" (*hos estin archē, prōtotokos ek tōn nekrōn*; v. 18b). The sense of primacy communicated by *prōtotokos*46 is further highlighted by the phrase, "that in everything he might be preeminent." There is a measure of similarity of sound between the two terms ( *prōtotokos*, firstborn; and *prōteuōn*, preeminent) to further link them together. So the meaning of the participle *prōteuōn* (from the verb *prōteuō*, "to hold the highest rank in a group, *be first, have first place*") should govern our understanding of the meaning of *prōtotokos*, ruling out any suggestion that Christ is a created being.

<span id="page-222-5"></span>1:19 Paul now provides further explanation of what it means for the Son to be preeminent, opening with a clause that begins with *hoti* ("because"). The verse is difficult to translate and interpret because there is ambiguity concerning the function of the phrase *pan to plērōma* ("all the fullness"). Since the noun is neuter in gender, there are two possible readings. We could read the noun as (a) in the nominative case (indicating the subject of a sentence in Gk.), giving the meaning, "All the fullness was pleased to dwell in him." Alternatively, we could read the noun as (b) in the accusative case (indicating the direct object of a sentence), giving the meaning, "He [God, supplied from context] was pleased to have all the fullness dwell in him." The arguments for the two positions are quite even, and Moo suggests there is substantial measure of overlap in the two meanings if the phrase "all the fullness" is understood as shorthand for "God in all his fullness."47 On that basis, I am inclined to adopt position (a), as does the ESV. While the fine point of syntax may be challenging, the general sense of the verse is reasonably clear: God has ensured that in Jesus is found all that makes God to be God. As Moo points out, there is an interesting similarity between the wording of this verse and the Greek translation of Psalm 68:16: "the mountain that God desired to dwell in it."

<span id="page-222-0"></span><sup>45</sup> Cf. O'Brien, *Colossians–Philemon*, 57–61, for a good discussion.

<sup>46</sup> Cf. BDAG, s.v. πρωτότοκος.

<sup>47</sup> Moo, *Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon*, 133.

Thus, Moo says, "In a typical New Testament emphasis, Christ replaces the temple as the 'place' where God now dwells. . . . This is now where all that can be known and experienced of God is to be found."48

<span id="page-223-5"></span><span id="page-223-3"></span>1:20 The sentence expressing God's good pleasure or choice is continued further with a complementary infinitive that completes the train of thought: "and through him to reconcile all things to him [or, himself]" (AT). The compound verb *apokatallassō* is used twice in close proximity here in Colossians 1. The only other place in the NT where it is used is Ephesians 2:16. The pinnacle of this remarkable passage is the accomplishment of reconciliation.

### <span id="page-223-2"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-223-0"></span>Paul is often drawn into doxology as he reflects on the wonder of who God is and what he has accomplished in Christ. In this passage Paul covers God's activity under two related headings: creation and church (new creation). The first part creatively draws out implications of the text of Genesis 1.49 The second uses similar language to demonstrate that Christ has brought about new life for his people through his death on the cross. We see in this passage the close relationship between true theology and creative expression. Paul has given considerable thought not only to what he wants to say but also to how he wants to say it. Paul's consideration of the deep truths of the Scriptures and the events of Christ's life and death have led him to express these truths in an "exalted" manner. This is expressed in the careful balance of the passage and the repetition of key terms and phrases.

<span id="page-223-4"></span>In God's providence, this leads to a further effect. Paul's memorable expression of truth leads to the rich theology becoming embedded in the minds and hearts of those who hear or read it. Many Christians would identify Colossians 1:15–20 as a favorite or well-remembered passage. One of the reasons this text is memorized so often is that it is so memorable! The passage lends itself naturally to being memorized because the various "hooks" can be used to help remember the passage. Thus the form of the passage enables the truth to be communicated more effectively and with longer-lasting impact.

This is an important factor to consider when we choose songs to sing in our families and churches. Lyrically pleasing and theologically accurate songs of praise will lift the heart and shape the mind and disposition. Think of a modern song such as "In Christ Alone" or an older hymn such as "To God Be the Glory." Anyone who has sung either song a few times will almost certainly hear the tune in their head at the very mention of the title. And along with the tune will doubtless come some or all of the words. As the words of the song are considered, so the biblical theology they contain is brought to bear on our theological views, whether to reinforce or to challenge them. This is also a significant reason for making use of the

<span id="page-223-1"></span><sup>48</sup> Ibid.

<sup>49</sup> And likely also Proverbs 8:22–31. Cf. especially David Garland, *Colossians, Philemon*, NIVAC (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1998), 85.

<span id="page-224-4"></span>biblical Psalms for congregational praise. Paul will go on in 3:16 to emphasize the value of singing to one another (not simply speaking to one another). Memorable songs and other kinds of texts have great potential for communicating good theology in the modern world, particularly among communities that give priority to oral rather than written communication.

This remarkable "hymn" provides a foundation for theological reflection that drives us into the depths of Christology and Trinitarian theology. But it also has significant implications for creation theology and ecclesiology. There is no doubt that the focus of this "hymn" is the Son. But we are also told significant truths concerning the place of creation in the purposes of God. Christian readers used to language of "saving souls" and "going to heaven" should reflect on the prominent place of both creation and new creation in the narrative of the Bible. The Son is not only the one who has created "all things," including the physical creation: he is also the one in whom all things have been reconciled. God's purpose for creation is not that it should be rejected but that it should be renewed (so Johnston: "Christ is not only Lord over the cosmos in its entirety, despite its present fallen state; he is also Lord over the renewed cosmos that has already begun through the new life he has given to his people, the church"50). Christians must beware of an inappropriate disregard for the physical creation. Careful Christian thinking will have significant implications for Christians' care for, and stewardship of, creation.

<span id="page-224-3"></span><span id="page-224-2"></span><span id="page-224-1"></span><span id="page-224-0"></span>When Paul says that God (not explicit in the text) "was pleased . . . through him [Christ] to reconcile to himself all things" (1:19–20), does he teach universalism? It is always dangerous to use a difficult text as the basis for a doctrinal position that is otherwise apparently rejected. In the context of Colossians, several texts imply that God does not reconcile all things to himself in the sense of providing salvation for absolutely every creature. Sumney states, "Given what Colossians has to say about judgment, its writer is not asserting universal salvation. The struggle with the false teachers and the descriptions of the readers' former lives (1:21–22; 2:13) assume that some will not be saved."51 Likewise, Moo points to 2:15, where Paul indicates that spiritual powers "are not saved by Christ but vanquished by him."52 NT teaching elsewhere (cf., e.g., 1 Cor. 15:24–28; Rev. 20:7–10) is clear that only those who enter the kingdom of God by faith in Christ and the power of the Spirit will be saved. Paul's reference to "all things" being reconciled to God would seem to indicate that God brings ultimate peace, even among those who reject him. This does not mean that all are saved. Rather, "reconciliation" should be understood to include two aspects: restoration of relationship with God for those who have faith in Jesus Christ; and pacification of the rebellion of those who do not.53

<span id="page-225-4"></span>Paul develops the theme of reconciliation further, reminding the Colossians of their own personal experience of being transferred from alienation to reconciliation.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-225-3"></span>1:21 Paul moves from a generic description of God's act of reconciliation in the world to a specific description of the experience of the Colossian believers. Once again, there are strong similarities between this text and material in Ephesians. Broadly speaking, we can observe a common pattern: (a) once you were . . . , (b) but now God has acted, (c) so now you are. . . . This basic pattern is found in this portion of Colossians and also in Ephesians 2:1–10 and 2:11–22. More specifically, we can compare Colossians 1:21–22 with Ephesians 2:12 and 16 (table 3.3).

<span id="page-225-2"></span><span id="page-225-1"></span><span id="page-225-0"></span>Although God had accomplished reconciliation and peace through "the blood of his cross" (Col. 1:20), the personal experience of the Colossians prior to their conversion was alienation (Paul returns to the use of the second-person plural "you" in v. 21). Paul does not identify precisely from whom the Colossians were alienated, but comparison with the similar passage in Ephesians 2 suggests it was from God that they were alienated. Paul identifies this alienation in terms parallel to his prayer in Colossians 1:10. In both cases he brings actions and thought together.

<span id="page-226-5"></span>In 1:21 he highlights the "total depravity" of alienation from God, impacting both the will and the mind. In 1:10 he prays for fruitfulness in good works and growth in knowledge of God. Alienation was not simply a passive distance from God but an active hostility toward him (cf. Rom. 8:7).

<span id="page-226-1"></span>TABLE 3.3: Similarities between Colossians 1:21–22 and Ephesians 2:12, 16

1:22 The only solution is the intervention of God, and that is precisely what Paul expounds. Paul presents the history of the Colossians in the "once . . . , but now" schema seen also in both the first and second parts of Ephesians 2. Although the Colossians passage is much more condensed than the text in Ephesians, the fundamental pattern is clear in both letters: mankind was willfully rebellious and completely helpless, but "he" acted decisively to transform alienation into reconciliation. Who is this "he"? There is some ambiguity, since Paul uses the pronoun "he" freely without always making the antecedent explicit. There is certainly reference to Christ in the context ("the body of his flesh through death"; Col. 1:22 KJV), but there may also be an implied antecedent of the Father from 1:19. This would tie in well with the role of the Father in the narrative of 1:13. Christ, however, appears to be the main actor in the parallel passage in Ephesians 2:14–16, so it is difficult to come to a confident judgment.

<span id="page-226-9"></span><span id="page-226-8"></span><span id="page-226-6"></span><span id="page-226-3"></span>In either case, there is complete harmony of will and action. God's response to this hostility is to accomplish reconciliation, an act only he could accomplish. The use of the verb *apokatallassō* ("to reconcile"; Col. 1:22) forms a clear link between what has been said in the preceding section (note the use of the same verb in v. 20) and this passage, and it is clear that the theme of reconciliation is crucial to understanding the change of situation the Colossians have experienced. Whereas the verb *katallassō* is used several times in Romans and 1 and 2 Corinthians, the compound verb *apokatallassō* is found only in Ephesians 2:16 and Colossians 1:20 and 22.

<span id="page-226-7"></span><span id="page-226-4"></span><span id="page-226-2"></span><span id="page-226-0"></span>The believers' reconciliation has been accomplished "in [Christ's] body of flesh by his death." The Greek phrase here employs two words that might be used to describe someone's body. The word *sōma* is used eight times in various sections of Colossians (1:18, 22, 24; 2:11, 17, 19, 23; 3:15) with a number of different nuances. In 1:18, e.g., it was used figuratively, in a way similar to 1 Corinthians 12:13, 27. Here in Colossians 1:22, however, it refers to Jesus' physical body. But this term,

which might have stood on its own, is combined with the term *sarx* ("flesh"), which emphasizes its frailty and vulnerability (though not, in this case, its sin). The key matter relating to Christ's body here is his death, giving the sense of his "earthly body . . . subject to death."54 The use of *dia* followed by the genitive case indicates means: reconciliation comes *through* Christ's death.55

<span id="page-227-2"></span>This act of reconciliation accomplished through Christ's death was not without purpose. The purpose is expressed using an infinitive plus adjectives: "to present you holy and blameless . . . before him." Note the recurrence of the adjective *hagiois*, which was previously used in 1:2, 4, and 12. There the emphasis was on the believers' status as saints, "holy ones," definitively set apart for God. In this verse, however, the emphasis shifts to a future hope: that the purpose God is working out in the lives of the Colossians will be brought to completion (cf. Phil. 1:6) and the Colossian Christians will be brought to the point of moral perfection.

<span id="page-227-6"></span><span id="page-227-1"></span>1:23 The way God's decisive saving activity in Christ is forcefully described makes the following qualification all the more striking: "If indeed," says Paul (using the emphatic particle *ge*), "you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister." The conditional particle ("if") should be read as indicating a real condition. Paul is not engaging in theological speculation regarding whether a true believer is able to fall away. He is simply warning believers not to fall away! The impact of Paul's words are well summed up by J. I. Packer: "The only proof of past conversion is present convertedness."56

<span id="page-227-0"></span>The way to ensure that one reaches the goal is to remain "stable and steadfast." The word translated "stable" is exactly the same participial form of the verb used in Ephesians 3:17 (there translated "grounded"), the only two occurrences of the word among the letters of Paul. This positive description is then balanced with a negative phrase: "not shifting." Where does one find this stability? The answer Paul gives is "the hope of the gospel that you heard." This phrase recalls the words of Colossians 1:5–6. The Christian's hope lies in the proclaimed and heard message of God's saving acts in Christ. It is these acts and this Christ that have absorbed Paul's attention throughout this opening section of the letter. The repetition of the connection between hope and gospel might have been intended to function as an inclusio for this first part of the chapter.

<span id="page-227-4"></span><span id="page-227-3"></span>Paul further explains this gospel: first, it is the gospel that "has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven." This phrase recalls Paul's comment in 1:6 that the gospel is bearing fruit and growing "in all the world." The global perspective evident in that earlier statement is still clear at the closure of the inclusio. Yet Paul does not feel bound to use the word he used earlier (*kosmos*). Instead, he now picks up one of the key terms used in the exalted prose of 1:15–20: *ktisis*, "creation"

<span id="page-227-5"></span><sup>54</sup> BDAG, s.v. σῶμα.

<sup>55</sup> Wallace, *Greek Grammar beyond the Basics*, 369.

<sup>56</sup> J. I. Packer, *Keep in Step with the Spirit* (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2005), 60–61.

<span id="page-228-6"></span>(v. 15). The gospel has been proclaimed to all that Christ, the content of the proclamation, has created.

<span id="page-228-5"></span>Paul's second qualification of the gospel also recalls an aspect of what he said earlier in the letter. In 1:7, Paul described Epaphras, the herald of the gospel from whom the Colossians first heard of the hope that had transformed their lives, as "a faithful minister [or servant] of Christ on your behalf." Now in 1:23 he again identifies a servant (*diakonos*) by name, but this time it is "I, Paul," who has become a minister (or servant) of the gospel.

<span id="page-228-4"></span>We thus see a remarkable echo in verses 21–23 of the early verses of Paul's thanksgiving (vv. 3–8). In these verses, Paul's central focus is on the gospel that brings hope, proclaimed throughout all creation by those who are servants both of Christ and of his gospel.

### *Response*

<span id="page-228-7"></span><span id="page-228-3"></span><span id="page-228-1"></span><span id="page-228-0"></span>The portrait of humanity that Paul paints in 1:21 is bleak but entirely in keeping with the consistent testimony of Scripture, from the narrative of the fall (Genesis 3) to the full presentation of fallen humanity in Romans 1–3 and the complementary statements in Ephesians 2. Sin, or willful rebellion against God, leads to a state of helpless slavery, which the experience of the Israelites in Egypt and later the exiles in Assyria and Babylon portrayed vividly in national terms. The exodus and the return from exile promised new hope, but the reality was that those who were freed were as enslaved as always by their human nature and their heart rebellion against God.

<span id="page-228-8"></span><span id="page-228-2"></span>Paul uses conditional sentences at several points throughout Colossians, notably in 1:23 (cf. the similar statement in 1 Cor. 15:2). These sentences that include the word "if" provide an opportunity for Christians to examine themselves. They need not cause a fundamental insecurity on the part of the believer, but they do press us to consider whether we are indeed fulfilling the condition Paul identifies. The gospel is the only hope for human beings, not only at the point when we first exercise faith in Christ but at every point of our lives. Such conditional statements offer those who might be tempted to place their confidence somewhere else, or who have drifted from wholehearted confidence in the gospel, to seek the Lord's grace once again.

### COLOSSIANS 1:24–29

**24**Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, **<sup>25</sup>** of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, **<sup>26</sup>** the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. **27**To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. **28**Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. **29**For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.

### *Section Overview*

In this section, Paul reflects on his own calling to be a minster of the gospel, with particular reference to the Gentiles. This leads him to comment on the glory of the gospel.

### *Section Outline*

- VI. Paul's Costly Ministry for the Sake of the Church (1:24–29)
	- A. Rejoicing in Suffering for the Sake of the Church (1:24–25)
	- B. The Mystery, Once Hidden and Now Revealed (1:26–28)
	- C. Toiling in God's Strength (1:29)

<span id="page-229-3"></span><span id="page-229-2"></span><span id="page-229-1"></span>1:24 The personal reference in 1:23 leads from a richly theological section of the letter to a deeply personal one, informed throughout by Paul's grasp of the gospel. Verses 24–28 provide further information about Paul's ministry, including reference in verses 24 and 28 to the hardships he had experienced. Paul's focus remains, however, on his message.

<span id="page-229-5"></span><span id="page-229-4"></span>The apostle begins this new section with a note of rejoicing (*nyn chairō*, "now I rejoice"). The section begins somewhat abruptly without any conjunction, a relatively unusual feature in Hellenistic Greek known as asyndeton.57 The verb *chairō* is used twice in Colossians (1:24; 2:5) and frequently elsewhere in Paul's other letters, especially 2 Corinthians and Philippians, both of which letters reflect quite extensively on Paul's hardships. Paul's commitment to rejoicing is not contingent on pleasant circumstances.

Paul's reference to "filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions" is initially perplexing, but becomes less so when we hold fast to the principle that less clear texts should be interpreted in the light of those that are clearer. It is clear from Paul's writings that he sees no lack in Christ's death. We need only to consider the emphatic way in which he has spoken of the accomplishments of Christ on the cross earlier in this same letter (cf. Col. 1:12–13, 19–22). Rather, Paul appears to have in mind the necessary future suffering of the "body of Christ," the church. He desires to submit to such suffering so that his fellow believers might be spared. In this he demonstrates an attitude very similar to that of Jesus himself.

<span id="page-230-3"></span><span id="page-230-2"></span>1:25 Paul sums up his calling as, "to make the word of God fully known." In the Greek text, the final phrase of the verse is "the word of God," which is followed immediately in verse 26 by "the mystery" (*to mysterion*).

<span id="page-230-5"></span><span id="page-230-4"></span><span id="page-230-1"></span>1:26 "The mystery" is, thus, another way of speaking of God's word or message, which is "the word of the truth, the gospel" (1:5). Here we have the first of four references to "mystery" in Colossians (1:26, 27; 2:2; 4:3). The term *mysterion* refers to "the unmanifested or private counsel of God."58 The NT notion of mystery is that which was once hidden but is now revealed. Indeed, the content of the mystery is explained in the very next verse. In retrospect, we can see there were already glimpses in the OT of the mystery that the Gentiles would be gathered into the people of God (e.g., Gen. 12:1–3), but for many, including Paul, these glimpses remained hidden even when in plain view. In contrast to the "mystery religions" of Paul's day, the gospel is not hidden or accessible to only a select few.

<span id="page-230-0"></span>1:27 The one who has made the mystery known is the sovereign God. He has chosen to make known the glorious message that the Gentiles have now been included in his people in Christ. This mystery, which encompasses all the richness of the gospel message, is summed up in one short phrase: "Christ in you, the hope of glory." This expression is very condensed. The primary focus of Christian hope is not "glory" in the sense of some undefined heavenly bliss; it is Christ himself. Paul's understanding of the mystery and of Christian hope is thoroughly Christological. Paul speaks both of "Christ in you" and of Christ seated at the right hand of God (3:1–4). While Christ is physically present in the heavenly realm, he is present in his people by the Spirit.

<span id="page-230-7"></span>1:28 Paul returns to his own calling, and his emphasis falls on the relative pronoun "him": "*Him* we proclaim." Paul's entire purpose is to make Christ known. This involves both negative ("warning") and positive ("teaching") aspects, with a view toward presenting "everyone mature [*teleion*] in Christ." *Teleios* is used twice in Colossians (1:28; 4:12; cf. also the related term in 3:14). BDAG suggests that Paul is probably making an allusion to being "initiated" into a rite here.59 It is certainly possible that Paul might use the term ironically, but such a conclusion is not neces-

<span id="page-230-6"></span><sup>58</sup> BDAG, s.v. μυστήριον.

<sup>59</sup> BDAG, s.v. τέλειος.

sary to make sense of his usage here. The threefold repetition of "everyone" ( *panta anthrōpon*) emphasizes that the gospel is offered to absolutely everyone and that Paul's desire is inclusivity. It may also be an intended contrast with the exclusive nature of the mystery cults.

<span id="page-231-2"></span><span id="page-231-1"></span>1:29 Paul returns to a personal reference, linking this verse with verses 23–25. He presents his efforts as a demanding struggle (language that will be picked up in the next verse) but nevertheless testifies to the "energy that he powerfully works within me" (cf. similar statements in 1 Cor. 15:10; Phil. 2:13; 4:13). It is likely that the referent of "his" and "he" is Christ, mentioned in Colossians 1:28.

### *Response*

It is never easy or pleasant to suffer, but it is necessary to put suffering into proper perspective. While Paul's calling as a minister, or servant, is not typical of all Christians, his approach to suffering is instructive. He regards his suffering as a means of identifying with his Savior and also with other Christians who face suffering. In an age when many Christians in many parts of the world face extreme suffering on account of their faith in Jesus Christ, we must consider how Paul sets his own suffering (and that of others) in the context of Christ's suffering for his people and the hope of the gospel (cf. Rom. 8:18).

<span id="page-231-3"></span><span id="page-231-0"></span>Paul is also willing to toil and struggle (Col. 1:29) for the goal of presenting believers mature in Christ (v. 28). He shows a selfless attitude, seeking the good of others before his own comfort. What is more, Paul recognizes that if he is able to show determination in the face of afflictions, it is because God is at work in his life (cf. also 1 Cor. 15:10; Phil 2:13; 4:13).

The more that Paul reflects on the glory of the gospel, the more his sufferings seem of little consequence. When we face suffering, a similar deliberate choice to focus on the glory of Christ and of the gospel may prove decisive in responding positively to trying circumstances.

### COLOSSIANS 2:1–5

2 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, **<sup>2</sup>** that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, **<sup>3</sup>** in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. **<sup>4</sup>** I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments. **5**For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-232-4"></span><span id="page-232-0"></span>2:1 The beginning of chapter 2 continues the personal reflection begun in 1:24. A significant link with what Paul has already said is created by means of cognate terms, as we shall see. Nevertheless, the introductory phrase, "for I want you to know," adds fresh emphasis. This phrase functions as a call to renewed attention to what will follow (cf. the similar construction in 1 Cor. 11:3, and also Phil. 1:12, although the vocabulary there is different). Paul emphasizes that he has experienced a "great . . . struggle" on behalf of the Colossians themselves and also "those at Laodicea" and (lit.) "those who have not seen my face in the flesh." Paul's reference to his *agōna* ("struggle") echoes *agōnizomenos* ("struggling") in Colossians 1:29 and suggests a "struggle against opposition."60 This athletic imagery is distinctively Pauline, with only one out of the six NT instances of this term occurring in a non-Pauline epistle (Phil. 1:30; Col. 2:1; 1 Thess. 2:2; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7; Heb. 12:1). Paul's service has cost him dearly.

<span id="page-232-8"></span><span id="page-232-6"></span><span id="page-232-5"></span><span id="page-232-2"></span>Paul's struggle was for believers in both Colossae and the neighboring city of Laodicea (c. 9 miles [14.5 km] away; cf. 4:13) and for a broader group of "all who have not seen me face to face." His service is for a community that extends far beyond believers he knows personally. This echoes his delight in the impact of the gospel both locally and globally (1:6).

<span id="page-232-7"></span><span id="page-232-3"></span><span id="page-232-1"></span>2:2 The reason (Gk. *hina* tends to express purpose) that Paul engages in this struggle is "that their hearts may be encouraged." The language Paul uses here is evocative of the way he speaks of Philemon's ministry (Philem. 7), although the vocabulary is somewhat different. Paul uses several phrases to support his main statement of purpose. First, he desires them to be "knit together in love." The verb *symbibazō*, with the sense of being held together, is found twice in Colossians 2 (vv. 2, 19) and also in Ephesians 4:16. The participle form used here clarifies what encouragement entails. Paul describes the outcomes he wishes to see using two prepositional phrases beginning with *eis*. These express purpose or result and should probably be read as parallel to each other. Paul desires the Colossians to

<span id="page-233-2"></span>know both "the riches of full assurance of understanding" and "the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ." This resembles, in some respects, Paul's prayer in 1:9 and also the prayer in Ephesians 3:14–19, as common vocabulary and/or ideas are found in each passage. The stark apposition of "mystery" and "Christ" implies that the mystery *is* Christ. This is similar in tone to Colossians 1:27 ("Christ in you, the hope of glory"). Paul repeatedly indicates that everything that is significant is Christological; indeed, everything significant is of Christ.

<span id="page-233-5"></span><span id="page-233-4"></span><span id="page-233-3"></span>2:3 This verse is the "christological high point of the letter."61 It begins with a relative phrase, as does 1:14. This time, however, "in whom" indicates the character of Christ, in whom "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." The phrase "wisdom and knowledge" echoes Paul's earlier comments in 1:9, although the language is not identical. All that a seeker of these things could possibly desire may be found in Christ.62 Moo draws attention to the linguistic similarities between this verse and Proverbs 2:1–8. He notes that the (for Paul) rare term *thēsauros* ("treasure") may be a particular echo of this and other wisdom texts.

<span id="page-233-6"></span><span id="page-233-0"></span>2:4 "I say this" calls the Colossians to careful attention. Paul emphasizes that he has made this statement about Christ because he is concerned that the Colossians might be deluded. He fears "plausible arguments" ( *pithanologia*). Pao states that, "In Classical Greek, this word [*pithanologia*] is used in reference to speculative arguments as opposed to empirical demonstration,"63 and so, particularly in combination with the verb indicating an act of deception, Paul is probably referring to such arguments in a pejorative manner. He does not explain precisely what these arguments are, and it is difficult to identify any known group that might have made them. Paul's emphasis on "wisdom" and "knowledge" in various parts of the letter suggests these concepts were possibly at the heart of the false philosophy. It is also unclear whether Paul is concerned that these arguments are already influencing the Colossian Christians or whether he is simply making them aware of potential threats. His warning is rather less emphatic than in Galatians, where the impact of "troublers" (cf. Gal. 5:10) of the Christian community in that region was unambiguous.

<span id="page-233-7"></span><span id="page-233-1"></span>2:5 Paul's motivation is made clear as he states that he is with the Colossians "in spirit" (*tō pneumati syn hymin eimi* ). In Greek this statement could indicate Paul's sense of human identity with the Colossians. Alternatively, it might signify the spiritual unity accomplished by the presence of the Spirit of God in both Paul and the Colossians. In English, however, we must choose whether to capitalize "spirit." The contrast between "body" and "spirit" perhaps suggests a more anthropological focus, with the sense that Paul is thinking of them. Moo, however, is probably right to suggest a measure of intended ambiguity.64

**<sup>6</sup>**Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, **<sup>7</sup>** rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.

**<sup>8</sup>** See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits*<sup>1</sup>* of the world, and not according to Christ. **9**For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, **<sup>10</sup>** and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. **<sup>11</sup>** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, **12**having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. **13**And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, **14**by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. **15**He disarmed the rulers and authorities*<sup>2</sup>* and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.*<sup>3</sup>*

**<sup>16</sup>**Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. **17**These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. **<sup>18</sup>**Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions,*<sup>4</sup>* puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, **<sup>19</sup>** and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

**<sup>20</sup>** If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations— **<sup>21</sup>** "Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch" **<sup>22</sup>** (referring to things that all perish as they are used)—according to human precepts and teachings? **<sup>23</sup>**These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.

<span id="page-235-7"></span><span id="page-235-6"></span><span id="page-235-2"></span>2:6 Paul uses *oun* ("therefore"), indicating a significant progression in his argument. A new section on Christian life begins with the first in a series of imperatives: "Walk in him" (cf. 1:10). Yet there is also strong continuity with the earlier warning against false teaching (2:4). The key to the believers' life must be Christ. Paul describes the believers' relationship with Christ in various ways. They have "received him," but they are also to "walk in him" and be "rooted and built up in him." That believers are "in Christ" is emphasized throughout the letter, and particularly in this section of chapter 2 (1:14, 16, 19, 22; 2:3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15; 3:20; 4:7, 17.

<span id="page-235-12"></span><span id="page-235-9"></span><span id="page-235-3"></span><span id="page-235-1"></span>2:7 The language of "rooted," "built up," and "established" is very similar to the language of Ephesians 3:17. These two verses contain the only occurrences of *rizoō* ("to root"; passive, "to be rooted") in the NT. Paul boldly mixes his metaphors between organic growth and the establishment of a building to explain what it means to "walk in him." The depth of a believer's relationship will enable that person to face the challenges Paul now describes.

<span id="page-235-10"></span><span id="page-235-8"></span>2:8 Paul warns against false teaching with an array of negative terms that leaves no doubt about his perspective. This verse is a stark contrast to verses 6–7. Paul's implication is that, if believers follow his instructions in the previous verses, they will be immunized against error. Scholars generally agree that the reference to "philosophy" suggests that false teachers described their teaching with this term. The phrase *ta stoicheia tou kosmou* ("the elemental spirits of the world") is used twice in this chapter (2:8, 20). The phrase also occurs twice in Galatians 4 (vv. 3, 9). Its meaning is debated (cf. BDAG, s.v. στοιχεῖον), but the sense here is probably "spiritual powers," perhaps connected with the basic "elements" of the physical world.

<span id="page-235-5"></span><span id="page-235-0"></span>2:9 The reason ("for") the Colossians are to reject such teaching is that everything it offers can already be found in its true form "in him" (Christ). The verse recalls the incarnational theology of 1:19 by means of common words (*katoikeō*, "dwell"; and *plērōma*, "fullness"). Yet, as O'Brien points out, the verb changes from an aorist in 1:19 (suggesting a perspective on the historical life of Jesus) to the present tense here.65 While changes in tense should not be overinterpreted, there is perhaps a change of focus here from the period of Jesus' earthly ministry to the risen Christ, who remains in bodily form.

<span id="page-235-11"></span><span id="page-235-4"></span>2:10 Paul then builds on his reference to "fullness" with the statement that the believers have been "filled in him." There is nothing more the Colossians need to find anywhere else. Paul also makes further reference to Christ's headship over spiritual realities, using language reminiscent of 1:16–17. There is a measure of repetition in this epistle, apparently to ensure that the Colossians have understood the false teaching surrounding them in light of the full significance of Christ's rule over all things.

<span id="page-236-3"></span>2:11 In his epistles, Paul employs several different images to express the experience of believers in union with Christ. Here he takes up the OT rite of circumcision. Circumcision was the sign of the covenant and a distinctive mark of Jewish identity. It is clear from Galatians that there was considerable pressure on some early Christians to undergo physical circumcision. While Paul does not address this issue as directly in Colossians as he does in Galatians, he does indicate here that the Colossian believers have already experienced circumcision, but not physical circumcision. The implication is that Christ has fulfilled all that circumcision pointed to.

2:12 Within the same sentence, Paul switches from circumcision in Christ to burial with Christ in baptism and resurrection. This verse is significant for the discussion of the relationship between circumcision and baptism and also has implications for the appropriate mode of baptism. I will make no attempt in this limited space to resolve this issue. However, exegetically we can observe that Paul's main focus is on the believers' union with Christ. Paul reminds the Colossians that they have been raised to new life in Christ by the same power of God that raised Christ physically from the dead. This experience of death and resurrection in Christ marks a radical new start in the experience of believers.

<span id="page-236-6"></span>2:13 Verses 13–15 are a remarkable statement of the gospel. There are several points of similarity between Colossians 2:13 and Ephesians 2:1, 5 (table 3.4).

<span id="page-236-4"></span><span id="page-236-1"></span>

| Colossians 2:13                           | Ephesians 2:1, 5                           |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| And you, who were dead in your trespasses | And you were dead in the trespasses and    |
| and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God | sins. even when we were dead in our tres   |
| made alive together with him              | passes, made us alive together with Christ |

<span id="page-236-0"></span>TABLE 3.4: Similarities between Colossians 2:13 and Ephesians 2:1, 5

<span id="page-236-5"></span>In Colossians 2:13a, Paul describes the past predicament of the Colossians; their situation was bleak. The statement "and you were dead" is virtually identical in Colossians 2:13 and Ephesians 2:1, with only one minor difference in word order distinguishing them. Paul is clearly not speaking physically, but that is not to say he is speaking metaphorically. The death he speaks of is a real death, a spiritual death. While Ephesians 2:1 refers to "trespasses and sins," Colossians 2:13 refers to "trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh," harking back to the mention of circumcision in 2:11. Paul highlights the Gentile background of at least some of his readers.

<span id="page-236-2"></span>Paul goes on to explain that the transformation that has taken place is the result of God's powerful act (cf. 1:12–13; 2:12). Paul's theology of the gospel, while giving full importance to the role of Christ, is nevertheless consistent in ascribing the initiatory role to God the Father.

Paul identifies "trespasses" (that is, breaches of God's standards) as the reason for the original condition of spiritual death, and thus these trespasses must be dealt with if the believer in Christ is to experience life. At this point, Paul simply declares that God has forgiven these trespasses (cf. 1:14). He will go on in the following verses to explain how this has been achieved.

<span id="page-237-1"></span><span id="page-237-0"></span>2:14 Verses 14 and 15 contain a striking number of unique or rare terms. Paul explains that a "record of debt" (*cheirographon*) stood "against us" (Paul shifts to first-person plural pronouns as he describes the experience of every believer). This record was perfectly legitimate, conforming to legal regulations. However, to bring new life to believers, this record of debt had to be "wiped away" or "canceled" (*exaleipsas*). God did so by "nailing it to the cross." Although Paul does not explain the mechanics in fine detail, we can see the broad contours of a doctrine of substitutionary atonement: we were guilty; God canceled the debt; he did so by the cross of Christ so that we were no longer obligated to the debt.

<span id="page-237-2"></span>2:15 But it was not merely *debt* that was dealt with on the cross. This verse is an important statement of the victory of Christ on the cross over the powers opposing him. Paul declares that the rulers and authorities (*tas archas kai tas exousias*) were disarmed and put to shame. The language of triumph presents the picture of a Roman triumphal procession in which those who were defeated would be last in line, awaiting the final blow. Paul declares that the various powers that might appear to hold authority in this world are in fact already defeated.

<span id="page-237-3"></span>2:16 Paul now moves the discussion forward (using *oun*, "therefore") to deal with practical issues faced by the Colossians. He urges them not to allow themselves to be judged by others. The matters on which they might be judged are a peculiar blend of religious and philosophical influences; some appear to relate to ritual aspects of Judaism, while others do not. So it is likely that the false teachers were drawing on various sources to create their own religious tradition. Paul's main concern is for the Colossians not to be overwhelmed by those who stressed these things.

<span id="page-237-4"></span>2:17 Paul explains that these regulations are just a shadow, while the reality is found in Christ. This is another variation of the superiority-of-Christ argument that has run throughout this letter.

<span id="page-237-5"></span>2:18 Paul uses the same third-person imperative form as in verse 16 to urge the Colossians not to be "disqualified" from their Christian life by those who insist on another range of activities. This list appears to relate to religious traditions of diverse nature, including mystery religions. Paul presents the language in terms of an individual who not only holds erroneous views but who also is "puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind." Thus the problem relates to the teacher's character as well as his beliefs.

<span id="page-238-5"></span><span id="page-238-2"></span>2:19 The fundamental problem with the false teacher is that he is "not holding fast to the Head." Here Paul recalls the language of 1:18 and 2:10. The "Head" is Christ, and only in relation to him can true knowledge and wisdom be found. Paul moves from the reference to the head to a more developed metaphor of the Christian community as a body. This is similar to the body metaphor in 1 Corinthians 12:12–31, although Paul develops the image in different ways in the two passages.

<span id="page-238-6"></span><span id="page-238-4"></span><span id="page-238-1"></span>2:20 Having warned the believers regarding false teaching, Paul now challenges them directly concerning inconsistency between their personal experience and their lifestyle. As usual, the conditional particle *ei* should be read as "if." Paul recalls what he described as fact in verse 12 but now calls the Colossians to reflect on whether that is truly their experience and, if so, why they are living inconsistently with that reality. The "elemental spirits of the world" appeared previously in verse 8. Paul reminds the Colossians that these "elemental spirits" hold no power over them, but the believers must live out that reality.

<span id="page-238-7"></span><span id="page-238-3"></span>2:21 The text continues with a series of imperatives. There is no unambiguous means by which one can determine whether these are Paul's own imperatives or not, but because they appear to propose an ascetic, world-denying philosophy, they are generally understood to be quotations by Paul of the opponents' position. Paul takes a similar approach in 1 Corinthians 7:1.

<span id="page-238-8"></span><span id="page-238-0"></span>2:22 Paul here provides a passing comment on the nature of the prohibitions he has just quoted. The commands relate to the world of temporal things, and they are "according to" human rules and doctrines. The phrase *tōn anthrōpōn* ("of men" or "of humans") suggests a contrast with instruction that comes from God.

<span id="page-238-9"></span>2:23 Paul concludes his warnings about false teaching with a devastating summary. These outward regulations appear to be beneficial and even to lead to "wisdom" (apparently a key theme for the opponents Paul has been confronting). However, they relate only to externals. They cannot change the heart.

### *Response*

Human beings are often attracted to dramatic acts of self-denial in their search for peace and for God. However, the message of the gospel refutes all such attempts to make a grand gesture for God. God has already accomplished all that is required in Christ, and so there is nothing further that can be done. Even those of us who have believed the gospel can be led to believe that externals are what matter most to God. If that begins to happen, we must be confronted with reality just as Paul confronted the Colossians. And the best way for that to happen is to do just what Paul did: present the true gospel again in its simplicity and completeness.

### COLOSSIANS 3:1–17

3If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. **<sup>2</sup>** Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. **3**For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. **4**When Christ who is your*<sup>1</sup>* life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

**<sup>5</sup>**Put to death therefore what is earthly in you:*<sup>2</sup>* sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. **6**On account of these the wrath of God is coming.*<sup>3</sup>* **<sup>7</sup>** In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. **8**But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. **<sup>9</sup>**Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self*<sup>4</sup>* with its practices **<sup>10</sup>** and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. **11**Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave,*<sup>5</sup>* free; but Christ is all, and in all.

**<sup>12</sup>**Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, **13**bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. **14**And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. **<sup>15</sup>**And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. **16**Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. **17**And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

### *Section Overview*

Paul now turns to focus on the impact of the gospel on the life of the Christian community in Colossae. While it is true that Paul emphasizes practical Christian living in this portion of the letter, it is not the case that he turns away from theology to focus solely on practice. In fact, Paul's understanding of Christian life is rooted and nourished by theological truth.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-240-8"></span>3:1 Paul now draws together theology and pastoral counsel. He constantly interweaves theology and practice, Christian faith and Christian life. All theology has practical implications, and all practice has theological foundations. He introduces this new section with *oun* ("then"), drawing an inference from what has come before. Here (3:1–4) Paul draws on theological foundations laid earlier in the letter and highlights the implications of these truths for the Colossian Christians.

<span id="page-240-9"></span><span id="page-240-5"></span><span id="page-240-4"></span><span id="page-240-2"></span>Paul reminds the Colossians that they "have been raised with Christ." This same term, *synēgerthēte* ("you were raised with"), has already been used in 2:12 (cf. Eph. 2:6), so Paul is drawing the Colossians' attention back to the narrative of God's actions in Christ, recounted in chapter 2. Here he shows further implications of the believers' union with Christ. In fact, their participation in Christ impacts their identity so significantly that their attention is to be focused entirely on Christ.

Paul commands them to seek (*zēteite*, plural imperative) "the things that are above" (*ta anō*). The use of the neuter plural article does not define the nature of these "things" precisely, but the context makes it clear that the primary focus of attention is to be Christ, who is "seated at the right hand of God." That is, he is in the place of honor and authority. Paul's words recall Psalm 110:1, with the implication that Christ is the one to whom this psalm points. This is consistent with the importance of this psalm elsewhere in the NT, notably in Hebrews.

<span id="page-240-12"></span><span id="page-240-10"></span><span id="page-240-3"></span><span id="page-240-0"></span>3:2 Paul then issues a second, virtually synonymous command using the verb *phroneō* (cf. Phil. 2:5). Paul calls for a deliberate act of the mind to focus on the things above. This is further clarified by a contrasting negative statement (*ta anō phroneite, mē ta epi tēs gēs*) calling Christians to direct their minds away from "things that are on earth."

<span id="page-240-11"></span><span id="page-240-7"></span><span id="page-240-6"></span><span id="page-240-1"></span>3:3 The imperatives are followed by a theological rationale, marked by the explanatory conjunction (*gar*): "for you died." This reference to the death of the believer is rather different from what was said in the earlier part of chapter 2. There, the believer was "circumcised" and "buried," but the only mention of death related to the condition of those who "were dead in your trespasses" (2:13). That was a death that led to helplessness and hopelessness. But a little further on, Paul says, "with Christ you died" (Col. 2:20), indicating a death that occurs in union with Christ. This death brings liberation. Paul's thought is very similar to that of Romans 6: a destructive relationship has been brought to an end through death, and that death has brought freedom from that which once held the believer captive.

<span id="page-241-2"></span><span id="page-241-1"></span>Because Christians "died," their lives are now "hidden with Christ in God." This language stretches our capacity for understanding the glories of the gospel. Paul's statement bears possible echoes of OT texts such as Psalms 27:5–6; 31:19–20; Isaiah 49:2. The perfect form of the verb *kryptō* may suggest security in a place of safety. In this respect, it is similar to Paul's statement in 1:5 that the Christians' hope is kept for them in heaven. It may also suggest that there is more to the experience of these Colossian believers than can be seen with human eyes.

<span id="page-241-5"></span><span id="page-241-3"></span>3:4 The fundamental nature of the change that has taken place is expressed in the remarkable statement, "When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory." The past life of the believers came to an end when they died with Christ. Now the only life they have is life in Christ, so much so that Paul can say that Christ *is* their life. There is a sense in which we might describe this as "eschatological" language (speaking of that which will take place in the "last days") and also "apocalyptic" language (speaking of what will appear). However, it is important to note that, while there is a measure of future expectation expressed here, Paul's language emphasizes a reality that has already begun in the present. "Eschatology," in NT terms, is less about "the end of the world" and more about "the change of the ages." And that change has already begun, both cosmically and personally, because of what God has accomplished in Christ. The repetition of the phrase "your life" emphasizes that the experience of the Christian, the person united to the risen Christ by faith, is indeed *life*.

<span id="page-241-6"></span><span id="page-241-4"></span>3:5 Verses 1–4 have emphasized a fundamental spiritual change that has taken place in the life of a Christian because of their union with Christ. Having established this vital theological foundation, Paul now addresses imperatives to the Colossian Christians. And the link between the indicative (what has already taken place) and the imperative (what must now be done) could hardly be clearer or more paradoxical: "you have died" (v. 3); therefore, "put to death" (v. 5)! We might well ask why it is necessary to put something to death if it has already died. But this manner of speaking captures beautifully the paradox of living in the experience often described as the "already" and the "not yet." Something definitive has already been accomplished by God in Christ, but the full realization of it still awaits.

<span id="page-241-7"></span>What follows, particularly in verses 5–11, is a collection of "vice and virtue lists."66 I will highlight just a few significant issues in this passage. The vice list in the latter part of verse 6 includes attitudes and activities relating mainly to a perversion in some way or other of sexual desire, in itself a good and appropriate aspect of human existence (so Gen. 2:24–25). More general sinful behavior is identified toward the end of the list.

<span id="page-241-8"></span><span id="page-241-0"></span>3:6 Paul warns that "the wrath of God is coming." The further detail that God's wrath is coming on those who are characterized by disobedience ("the sons of disobedience") is textually doubtful and thus not included in the main text of the

<sup>66</sup> Cf. the discussion in Pao, *Colossians and Philemon*, 216–218, and the notes on these verses in the *ESV Study Bible*.

Colossians 3:1–17 242

<span id="page-242-0"></span>ESV (cf. mg.). The language of the coming of the wrath of God is similar to that of Romans 1:18, where Paul writes that "the wrath of God is revealed."

3:7 However darkly Paul presents these sinful acts, he does not regard them as placing a person beyond hope. Indeed, he expressly indicates that the Colossians also "once walked" in such sins. However, everything has changed because of the events described in verses 1–4. Paul draws a sharp contrast between "once" ( *pote*; v. 7) and "but now" (*nyni de*; v. 8).

<span id="page-242-7"></span><span id="page-242-6"></span><span id="page-242-4"></span>3:8 As Paul proceeds to describe the things the Colossians must "put away," he shifts toward sinful patterns of speech.

<span id="page-242-8"></span>3:9 This verse illustrates well the complex relationship between the indicative (what has been done) and the imperative (what must be done) in Paul's theology and ethics. The imperative, "do not lie to one another," is explained by a statement of what has taken place (the indicative, so to speak, although the form is actually an aorist participle). Here the metaphor for change shifts from death and life (v. 5) to putting clothes off (v. 9) and on (v. 10).

<span id="page-242-9"></span><span id="page-242-5"></span><span id="page-242-3"></span>3:10 Significantly, Paul says that this has already been done, and yet the "new self" experiences ongoing renewal into "the image of its creator." The reference to "image" recalls 1:15, which states that the Son is the image of the invisible God and is the one who has created all things.

<span id="page-242-10"></span><span id="page-242-2"></span>3:11 Paul reflects on the significance of the transformation that has taken place. This verse bears strong similarity to Galatians 3:28, including some common vocabulary (particularly the pairs of Jew and Greek, slave and free), but the verse in Colossians includes several other comparisons not found in Galatians. Further, it concludes with a Christological climax: "Christ is all, and in all." Paul is not claiming that all distinct identities are abolished. As Sumney comments, "The idea of oneness in Colossians is not sameness." He adds, "Even in Galatians, Paul does not call for all believers to be the same, but for all to recognize that being one in Christ must take precedence over all differences. It is this primacy of the believer's identity in Christ that comes to expression in Colossians as well."67

<span id="page-242-11"></span><span id="page-242-1"></span>3:12 Paul returns to the clothing metaphor and commands the Colossians to "put on" various character traits. Interestingly, Paul says they *have* put on the new self (v. 10) but also *must* put on these qualities (v. 12). This list of qualities reflects closely the character of Christ himself, in a way similar to 1 Corinthians 13. Paul's command is qualified by descriptions of what the Colossians are in Christ. He focuses on the status of believers as united to Christ ("God's chosen ones, holy and beloved"). Paul is not calling for a moral "self-help" drive. Rather he wants the life of Christ to be seen more distinctly in the Colossians' lives. He desires them to live consistently with the spiritual realities that are already true.

<sup>67</sup> Sumney, *Colossians: A Commentary*, 204, 205.

<span id="page-243-5"></span>3:13 Paul emphasizes the attitudes that will foster true community among believers. In particular, he calls Christians to demonstrate grace toward each other, as the Lord has shown grace to them. This recalls the teaching of Jesus in Matthew 6:14–15.

<span id="page-243-6"></span><span id="page-243-1"></span>3:14 The metaphor of putting on clothes continues with the call to put on love like a cloak that covers everything else. While Paul has listed many virtues, love appears to have a status above the others that allows it to bind them all together.

<span id="page-243-7"></span><span id="page-243-2"></span><span id="page-243-0"></span>3:15 Paul now gathers together a number of instructions intended to build up the community of believers. The phrase "the peace of Christ" is similar to "the peace of God" (Phil. 4:7). It may also recall Isaiah 9:6 ("Prince of Peace"). The expression is another way of saying, "Let Christ, who brings peace, rule." Paul picks up the significant image of the body mentioned earlier (Col. 1:18; 2:19). The final call to thankfulness almost seems an afterthought but in fact regularly punctuates the entire letter.

<span id="page-243-8"></span>3:16 Having urged believers to let the peace of Christ rule, Paul now similarly urges them to "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly." One of the ways this can happen is through mutual instruction and encouragement. Paul urges singing (probably a mixture of the canonical psalms and Christian compositions), not only as praise to God but also as a means of instructing one another. Once again, a brief note of thankfulness is sounded.

<span id="page-243-10"></span>3:17 This verse gathers everything in the chapter together. The various phrases used here are highly inclusive, encompassing every conceivable activity. And the call to thankfulness continues.

### *Response*

This section of Paul's letter shows that the most significant factor in bringing about transformed lives in a Christian community is an experience of being united to Christ in his death and resurrection. No amount of moral instruction can achieve what the power of God first achieves in the life of a human being. What is more, Paul calls us to deep and nuanced reflection on what God has accomplished for the believer in Christ. The greatest motivation to faithful Christian living is a realization of what God has already done in a believer's life.

<span id="page-243-9"></span><span id="page-243-4"></span><span id="page-243-3"></span>Paul gives high priority to deep Christian community, and so should we. Paul provides a blueprint for healthy living as the community of believers in chapter 3, as Christians are to be people who are united to Christ and reflect deeply on that fact (vv. 1–4); who actively choose to rid themselves of what is inconsistent with their new life and put on what radiates the reality of Christ in their lives (vv. 5–15); who choose to cultivate a spiritual life not only for themselves as individuals but also for the whole community (vv. 16–17).

### *Section Overview*

Paul employs the well-known structure of a "household code"68 to address the implications of Christian life for social relationships. Responsibilities are laid upon both those who have social status and those who do not.

### *Section Outline*

- X. Household Code (3:18–4:1)
	- A. Responsibilities of Wives and Husbands (3:18–19)
	- B. Responsibilities of Children and Fathers (3:20–21)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-244-2"></span><span id="page-244-0"></span>3:18–4:1 This passage follows the same basic structure as Ephesians 5:22–6:9 but is significantly briefer overall. The one section that is longer in Colossians is the address to slaves (ESV "bondservants"; 3:22; 4:1). While the code in Ephesians 5:22–6:9 includes substantial explanations to support Paul's instructions, such explanations are generally absent in Colossians. The significant measure of continuity between the two codes does suggest some formal link, although the discontinuities make direct literary dependence unlikely. Pao suggests that the distinct unit of text and the appearance of similar codes in various NT documents

<sup>68</sup> Martin Luther is generally regarded as having coined the German term "Haustafel" (plural: *Haustafeln*), which is frequently used in academic literature. See the discussion in Pao, *Colossians and Philemon*, 263–266.

<span id="page-245-1"></span>(notably Ephesians and 1 Peter) and elsewhere (e.g., *Did.* 4.9–11; *1 Clem.* 21.6–9) may suggest an existing tradition, adapted by the various writers, with different alterations in each case.69

The basic pattern is clear: Direct address, instruction, brief rationale. There are two exceptions to this pattern. First, in the instruction to husbands, no rationale is provided for the instruction. In its place is a second instruction ("love . . . and do not be harsh"). Second, in the instruction to bondservants, in place of a brief rationale is an extended explanation of the manner in which the instruction is to be carried out, as well as some rationale for that manner.

The balance of the imperatives is striking. In each pair there is one party who, in the Greco-Roman society of the day, had a position of authority, and one party who did not. It is not surprising that Paul would address exhortations to those who were under authority. It is more surprising that he also addresses exhortations to those who were *in* authority. O'Brien summarizes the research of Eduard Schweizer: "Wives, children and slaves are addressed equally with their husbands, fathers and masters. Although this is not totally new, there are no extant examples which are as thoroughgoing as Colossians 3:18–4:1 in this emphasis on reciprocal obligations."70 In fact, the key issue in this code is the question of where true authority lies, which is highlighted by Paul's repeated use of *kyrios* throughout the passage.71 While the term can be translated "master," and on some occasions should be translated as such, within Paul's writings the natural use of this term is to describe Jesus Christ as "Lord." All human relationships are set in the context of relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ, and any human authority is relativized by his ultimate authority.

<span id="page-245-4"></span><span id="page-245-3"></span><span id="page-245-2"></span>3:18 Paul begins with a direct address to wives (using a nominative plural noun with the article, which can function as an alternative to a vocative.72 The repeated use of direct address throughout this section provides structure to the passage and calls those in each group to pay particular attention to the instructions directed to them. Wives are called to "submit" (*hypotassesthe*) to their husbands (cf. Eph. 5:22, which does not actually contain an imperative but assumes the participle used in 5:21). The middle voice suggests something like "submit yourselves." That is to say, this instruction is not a harsh order intended to bring cringing subjugation. Rather, it is a call to make a deliberate decision, to choose to act in a certain way. The rationale for such a choice is that it is "fitting in the Lord." Thus the primary reason for the wife to choose to respond positively to this imperative is not her husband's will but the relationship she has to Christ. A form of the same verb is applied to Christ himself in 1 Corinthians 15:28: "When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all." While there are many discussions

<sup>72</sup> Pao, *Colossians and Philemon*, 262.

in commentaries regarding the various social factors that may have influenced Paul's view of male-female relationships, the fundamental reason for his view is Christological.

<span id="page-246-5"></span><span id="page-246-4"></span><span id="page-246-3"></span>3:19 Husbands, on the other hand, are instructed to "love your wives." Interpreters must be careful when dealing with the Greek verbs used for love. Too many popular expositions draw conclusions from the use of a particular verb, conclusions the language simply cannot support. Here the verb used is *agapaō*, which is often described as "self-giving" love or "divine" love (particularly in expositions of John 21). The actual usage of the various Greek verbs does not allow such a simplistic conclusion. However, drawing on comparisons to the parallel passage in Ephesians 5:25 (where husbands are instructed to love their wives as Christ loved the church) and the wider Christological context of the passage, it seems likely that the love husbands are to show is the kind of love Christ has shown to his people. This is indeed self-giving love. The short additional instruction not to be harsh may reflect typical experience in the culture of the day, which Paul calls men not to accept as valid. There is perhaps an echo here of Genesis 3:16, where the curse of the woman includes the statement that the husband "shall rule over you," suggesting an overbearing attitude. As noted above, no rationale is offered for these instructions to husbands.

<span id="page-246-6"></span><span id="page-246-1"></span><span id="page-246-0"></span>3:20 Children, unlike wives, are called to obey (*hypakouō*). This language recalls the fourth commandment, in Exodus 20. Once again, the rationale for obedience is one's relationship to the Lord: obedience by children to their parents "pleases the Lord."73

<span id="page-246-7"></span>3:21 Given that the paterfamilias had full authority in a Greco-Roman household, it is remarkable to see the father being instructed to act in an appropriate manner. It is probably because of this particular social structure that Paul addresses "fathers" rather than "parents." Fathers are instructed not to "provoke" their children. As in the case of husbands, it may be that Paul is warning of typical behavior in wider society into which Christian fathers may be drawn, whether by social pressure or by their own habits prior to becoming Christians. Christian fathers are expected to display the character of God, who shows compassion, as a father should (Ps. 103:8–14).

<span id="page-246-8"></span><span id="page-246-2"></span>3:22 Paul now addresses slaves, or bondservants, those who had the lowest status in the context of Greco-Roman society. Slaves are instructed to "obey" their masters. Paul uses the same verb (*hypakouō*) he used in addressing children (v. 20), and this basic instruction is qualified by two prepositional phrases. First, the bondservants are instructed to obey "in everything" (*kata panta*). That is, what is required is full obedience. Yet this command is somewhat qualified by the second phrase, which modifies the noun "masters." The Greek reads, "according to the flesh" (*kata sarka*),

<sup>73</sup> Cf. Pao, ibid., 269–270, for alternative possibilities, although he favors this interpretation.

<span id="page-247-6"></span>which means something like "in human terms" (ESV, "earthly masters"). The clear implication of this phrase, supported later in 4:1, is that Christian bondservants also have a "heavenly master," who has ultimate authority over them.

The conduct required of the bondservants is further clarified by a balanced "not like this, but like this" construction. Negatively, bondservants are not to offer simply "eye-service," working effectively only when being observed; nor are they to be "people-pleasers," seeking only affirmation. Positively, they are to work "with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord." We see, again, that the fundamental motivation for right behavior is a transformed heart and a wholehearted commitment to the Lord. In this context, the "Lord" is Jesus.

<span id="page-247-3"></span><span id="page-247-2"></span>3:23 Paul offers further positive instruction, employing an indefinite construction (*ho ean*, "whatever") to include all possible situations facing a Christian bondservant. The all-inclusive language echoes verse 17, which was addressed to the whole Christian community. The bondservants are to work "heartily." Although the Greek words are different, the phrases "with sincerity of heart [*kardias*]" in verse 22 and "heartily [*psychēs*]" in verse 23 are "virtually equivalent."74

<span id="page-247-4"></span>3:24 Paul provides support for his exhortation by reminding the Christian bondservants of what they apparently already know (using the participle *eidotes*, "knowing"), presumably from previous instruction in the faith. They should know they will receive "the reward of inheritance" (AT). The word for "reward" (*antapodosis*) occurs only here in the NT.75 Although in other Greek literature it tends to have a negative connotation, here, in conjunction with "inheritance" (*tēs klēronomias*), it should be understood positively. What a wonderful promise for a bondservant to hear! A bondservant was not an heir in a Greco-Roman family, but these bondservants are now part of the family of God; they are qualified "to share in the inheritance of the saints in light" (1:12). The implication of all that Paul has said is spelled out: "You are serving the Lord Christ [*to kyriō Christō*]." This combination of terms is rare (here and Rom. 16:18). As the terms "lord/master" (*kyrios*) and "Christ" are brought together, this text helps the reader to see the full significance of the many references to *kyrios* in this passage. Whatever human relationships may provide the context for this service, the true object of service by any believer in any position is Christ.

<span id="page-247-5"></span><span id="page-247-1"></span><span id="page-247-0"></span>3:25 The positive tone of 3:24 changes rather abruptly. Paul's statement in some sense provides support for what is said in the wider context. But it is not immediately obvious how that support should be understood. The most natural reading is to understand this warning as relating to what has immediately preceded it. Thus, as Paul has highlighted that the ultimate master/Lord is Christ, he also draws attention to the authority of that master to administer justice to "the wrongdoer." A similar thought is implied in the following verse.

<sup>74</sup> O'Brien, *Colossians–Philemon*, 228.

<sup>75</sup> Cf. BDAG, s.v. ἀνταπόδοσις.

4:1 Having concluded the lengthy section addressed to bondservants, Paul now turns to masters. Since masters effectively owned bondservants as property, it might well have seemed odd to some masters that obligations were being placed upon them with respect to their bondservants. But Paul instructs them to be just and fair. The call for fair treatment of bondservants was not unique to Christian authors. Among non-Christian writers, Seneca stands out as a powerful advocate for humane treatment of slaves (cf. his *Forty-Seventh Letter to Lucilius*). The rationale provided here for such behavior is that the masters themselves have a "Master" (*kyrios*) in heaven. That *kyrios* can be understood as both "master" (in a parallel to earthly masters) and "Lord" (referring to Jesus Christ) gives this statement great rhetorical power.

### *Response*

The modern social structures familiar to many readers of this commentary are very different from the social structures in the Greco-Roman world of the first century. (Readers who live in "non-Western" societies may, however, find that the differences are less pronounced.) Paul's household code reflects something of its historical context but also expresses fundamental principles that remain important in our own time and social circumstances. The kind of direction found here in Colossians is not at all unique. In fact, similar issues are addressed in a number of passages of Scripture, such as 1 Timothy 2–3; 1 Peter 3; and the similar passage in Ephesians 5–6.

<span id="page-248-4"></span><span id="page-248-1"></span>The most striking thing about this code is the way it calls Christians to live out their faith in whatever role they perform in society. That might be in a position of great authority or of little or no authority.

<span id="page-248-3"></span><span id="page-248-2"></span><span id="page-248-0"></span>Each imperative is directed toward those who must take responsibility for their own actions and attitudes. At no point is one group called to change another's attitude. All over the world, legislation and judicial decisions frequently challenge Christian perspectives on relationships within the home. In the face of cultural pressures, Christians are called to let God's Word, not contemporary cultural norms, shape our relationships (cf. Prov. 3:5–8). Love and submission may take different forms in different contexts, but we must not reject God's principles for interpersonal relationships. Christians can take courage by considering the significant witness of healthy Christian relationships within the home. Christian families who allow love, grace, and peace to be evident in the relationships between husbands and wives and parents and children will be observed by others. In addition, although the particular social structures addressed by the instructions to slaves and masters are no longer in place in the West, there is still great potential for Christian testimony by employers and employees who seek the good of others and work with all their heart, "as for the Lord" (Col. 3:23).

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-249-0"></span>The final section of Colossians is an extensive collection of final instructions and greetings, serving to highlight several of Paul's key concerns for the Colossians and also to locate the letter in the historical circumstances of that Christian community. The first few verses (vv. 2–6) address aspects of community life, while the remainder of the chapter is a lengthy list of greetings followed by a personal signature and a very short benediction.

### *Section Outline*

- XI. Paul's Request for Prayer (4:2–4)
- XII. Paul Calls for Gracious Christian Living (4:5–6)
- XIII. Final Greetings (4:7–18a)
- XIV. Benediction (4:18b)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-250-6"></span><span id="page-250-5"></span>4:2 Paul's final instructions may appear somewhat random, but in fact they pick up and reinforce key themes from earlier parts of the letter. Also, verses 2–4 and 5–6 follow a similar grammatical structure ("Both have an imperative followed by two participles and a phrase with the verb *dei* ["it is necessary"]."76).

<span id="page-250-3"></span><span id="page-250-1"></span><span id="page-250-0"></span>Paul's first priority is prayer. He has already modeled prayer for the Colossians in 1:9–12 and has alluded to prayer in various parts of chapter 3 (particularly with reference to thanksgiving), but now he directly calls the Colossians to pray. The verb *proskartereō* is rare in Paul's writings (elsewhere only in Rom. 12:12 and 13:6). According to BDAG, it means to persist, with fine nuances of "to be devoted to" or "persevere in."77 This implies that it would be easy not to persist. Paul explains what it means to persevere using a present participle, "being watchful" (or "awake"). Paul uses this term in a similar way in 1 Corinthians 16:13 and 1 Thessalonians 5:6 (and with a somewhat different sense in 1 Thess. 5:10). He then explains the attitude required: "with [or in] thanksgiving." Thanksgiving has been emphasized throughout the letter; it is to be a primary characteristic of the Christian church.

<span id="page-250-10"></span><span id="page-250-7"></span><span id="page-250-4"></span><span id="page-250-2"></span>4:3 Paul follows the general instruction to pray with a specific request that the Colossians pray for "us." The plural pronoun reinforces Paul's preference for working alongside others. His specific request is that "God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ." Here Paul picks up the language of "mystery" used earlier in 1:26–27; 2:2. The mystery is that Christ, the hope of glory, should be made known among the nations. This connects to the emphasis on mission evidenced throughout the letter and also highlights Paul's confidence that it is God who directs the mission. Mission is truly *missio Dei*, "the mission of God." His brief reference to his current imprisonment is solely to highlight that the gospel of Jesus is his absolute priority.

<span id="page-250-8"></span>4:4 Paul elaborates his request: "that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak." It is remarkable that, in spite of the commitment Paul has demonstrated to this point, he is nonetheless aware of his own human weakness and his need of God's enabling to carry out the task for which he has been commissioned.

<span id="page-250-9"></span>4:5 Now Paul turns to how the Colossians should relate to those outside the Christian community. He includes two main instructions (vv. 5–6). The first is to

<sup>76</sup> Sumney, *Colossians: A Commentary*, 255.

<sup>77</sup> BDAG, s.v. προσκαρτερέω.

<span id="page-251-3"></span>"walk in wisdom." Paul's expression here is similar to that in 1:10. In both cases, to "walk" is a way of speaking of a whole way of life. Wisdom for Paul is not simply knowledge, or even human life experience, but a gift from God. This instruction is qualified by a present participle: "redeeming the time" (KJV). The language of redemption has already been used several times in the letter, and here the sense is that every moment should be actively devoted to gospel service.

<span id="page-251-14"></span><span id="page-251-6"></span><span id="page-251-5"></span>4:6 Paul's second instruction is more specific, addressing the way believers should speak. Although Paul does not explicitly say that he is referring to speech directed toward those outside the Christian community, the context of the previous verse suggests this is the case. There is a strong similarity of thought between this verse and 1 Peter 3:15. The fact that no group is identified, however, allows for wider application. As Paul indicated in chapter 3, how a person speaks is very significant. Although Paul was capable of being very direct in his confrontation of evil (cf. Acts 13:10), his typical instruction is to be gracious in speech. The reference to "salt" recalls Jesus' teaching in Matthew 5:13. Here, however, the connotation of the term is not preservation but addition of taste, so that the presentation of the gospel may be given a good hearing.

<span id="page-251-8"></span><span id="page-251-2"></span><span id="page-251-1"></span><span id="page-251-0"></span>4:7–9 The letter closes with a substantial section of greetings. This makes comparison with Ephesians somewhat perplexing. Why would Paul write such extensive greetings to a church he did not know personally yet include virtually no greetings in a letter written to the church he had pastored for more than two years? In fact, a similar situation appears in Romans 16, where Paul greets many people in a church he has not yet visited. Similarly, 1 Thessalonians is a letter written to a church Paul knew well, but it does not include detailed greetings. This suggests we should be careful not to draw hasty conclusions from this feature.

<span id="page-251-13"></span><span id="page-251-7"></span>Several figures mentioned require some brief comment. Tychicus (v. 7) and Onesimus (v. 9) serve as those who will deliver the letter to the Colossian Christians. Both are described in the warmest of terms, using similar terminology.

<span id="page-251-9"></span><span id="page-251-4"></span>4:8 Tychicus's task is to share news and bring encouragement to the hearts of the Colossian believers. The phrase Paul uses here is very similar to Colossians 2:2.

<span id="page-251-10"></span>4:9 The reference to Onesimus inevitably leads anyone familiar with the NT to think of the Onesimus in Paul's letter to Philemon. Indeed, it is highly likely that this is the same person. Paul gives a very important place to sharing news with his Christian family.

<span id="page-251-11"></span>4:10 While Tychicus and Onesimus were free to travel, it would appear that Aristarchus was not. He is described as Paul's "fellow prisoner."

<span id="page-251-12"></span>4:11 The last mentioned colleagues are described as "men of the circumcision." While Paul can sometimes use such language to describe a sectarian group, here he is simply referring to Jewish believers.

Colossians 4:2–18 252

<span id="page-252-1"></span><span id="page-252-0"></span>4:12–13 Epaphras played a very significant role in the opening verses of the letter. Here, his commitment to the Colossians is highlighted. See the comments on 1:7 and Philemon 23.

<span id="page-252-8"></span><span id="page-252-7"></span><span id="page-252-2"></span>4:14 Luke and Demas receive passing mention. However, their impact on the early Christian community was very different. Luke, of course, produced crucial documents recounting the spread of the gospel. Demas, sadly, appears eventually to have deserted Paul (2 Tim. 4:10). When we find names used in various places in the NT, we should bear in mind the possibility that the same name used in multiple places could refer to different people. The use of names without further explanation, however, suggests these figures were well-known in the early Christian community.

<span id="page-252-3"></span>4:15 Paul sends his own greetings to the Christians at Laodicea. There was clearly a relationship between these two churches, as we shall see in the next verse as well. The reference to Nympha is ambiguous; it is unclear if she was based in Laodicea or in Colossae. She was apparently a woman of means who made her house available to the Christians as a meeting place. Nympha is one of numerous women mentioned in the NT who made significant contributions to the early Christian church.

<span id="page-252-4"></span>4:16 This verse provides fascinating insight into the dynamics of the early Christian community, particularly the formation of the canon of the NT. Although Colossians is clearly addressed to a particular group, Paul expresses his expectation that his letter would be read in the neighboring church also, and likewise that the letter written to the Laodiceans would be read in Colossae as well. Paul's letters are beginning to function beyond the scope of normal letters: they have become instruction that has relevance in various settings.

<span id="page-252-5"></span>4:17 Archippus receives a direct message from Paul, via the church. Unfortunately, we are unable to identify the particular nature of the ministry Paul mentions.

<span id="page-252-6"></span>4:18 As in Galatians and Philemon, Paul provides a signature in his own handwriting, presumably to authenticate the letter, but perhaps also to add a personal touch to the greetings he has sent. He adds a brief plea that the believers in Colossae would remember his situation as a prisoner. Even if Colossians was written under house arrest, Paul's freedom was still curtailed, and he seeks Christian support in prayer and in practical help. The final benediction is brief and pointed: Paul longs for believers to experience God's grace.

### *Response*

Paul's instructions on prayer and mission remind us of two priorities for the church. To Paul, prayer is not a pious retreat from the task of mission but rather the source of its direction and power. Will we respond to Paul's call to pray for gospel opportunities for ourselves and for our churches, and to pray that we will present the gospel message clearly and boldly, in a way accessible to those who hear?

<span id="page-253-0"></span>Paul's extensive list of greetings highlights the importance of relationships in the work of the kingdom of God (cf. Romans 16). If we are not cultivating relationships and commending those who serve with us, perhaps we need to read through Paul's final greetings a few more times. Grateful appreciation for those who served with him, expressed both to them and to others, was a significant part of Paul's ministry strategy.

Paul's final phrase prior to his benediction, "remember my chains," is a poignant reminder of the persecuted church. We are now able as never before to become aware of, pray for, and support believers who face serious opposition, including violence and death, on account of their faith. May Paul's brief words bring to mind those who experience chains, literal or metaphorical, because of their Christian testimony.

## <span id="page-259-3"></span>INTRODUCTION TO 1 THESSALONIANS

### *Overview*

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy encourage the Thessalonian church to continue walking as followers of Christ. Paul's missionary team had been compelled to leave these new believers before they were fully instructed and established as a church, and so the epistle spends much space comforting and exhorting the church from afar.

<span id="page-259-8"></span><span id="page-259-6"></span><span id="page-259-5"></span>Paul and his colleagues, expressing deep affection for the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 2:1–12; 2:17–3:10), assure them that their local assembly had become a model for others in Macedonia and Greece (1:6–10; 2:13–14). Paul also addresses the danger of sexual immorality amid pagan society (4:1–8), the church's disquiet about what happens to the Christian dead (4:13–18), and questions about the timing of Jesus' second coming (5:1–11).

### <span id="page-259-10"></span><span id="page-259-9"></span>*Author*

<span id="page-259-11"></span><span id="page-259-4"></span><span id="page-259-2"></span>The authors are listed as Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy (1:1). It is not unusual for Paul's epistles to include joint authorship with other ministry colleagues. However, such coauthorship is more pronounced in 1 and 2 Thessalonians. For example, the majority of first-person verbs referring to the authors in 1 Thessalonians are plural (i.e., "we"). Only rarely does the letter shift into first-person singular ("I" in 2:18; 3:5; 5:27). This can be contrasted with Paul's epistle to the Philippians, which begins with "Paul and Timothy" but quickly shifts to first-person singular authorship throughout ("I"). Thus, the collective authorship of 1 Thessalonians is more emphasized than in Paul's other epistles. Nevertheless, it is clear from 2:18 ("we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, again and again") that Paul is the lead author.

<span id="page-259-7"></span><span id="page-259-1"></span><span id="page-259-0"></span>Why, then, does Paul list Silvanus and Timothy as coauthors? Paul's team in Thessalonica included both Timothy and Silvanus/Silas (Acts 15:40; 16:3; 17:4, 10, 14–15). Furthermore, Timothy had just returned from Thessalonica, where he had been sent by Paul to establish further the church's faith (1 Thess. 3:1–10). Thus, in this letter, Paul presents the whole team as invested in the Thessalonians' spiritual welfare. Throughout this commentary, Paul will be addressed as author, but frequent reference will be made to "Paul and his colleagues" in order to remind ourselves of Paul's teamwork approach to missions.

<span id="page-260-4"></span>The letter's style and contents overlap substantially with Paul's other writings (note the many cross-references throughout this commentary). Although the letter is less overtly structured and theological than some of Paul's other epistles (esp. Romans), scholars today recognize that all of Paul's letters engage in theology through the lens of missions, attending to the theological and practical challenges of each community. The letter connects well with what we know of the Pauline mission in Thessalonica (Acts 17), and the early church (cf. the *Muratorian Canon*, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Eusebius) universally accepted Paul as author.

### <span id="page-260-0"></span>*Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-260-5"></span><span id="page-260-2"></span><span id="page-260-1"></span>Following a successful but brief ministry in Thessalonica, Paul and his colleagues were forced to flee the city (Acts 17:1–10; cf. comment on 1 Thess. 1:1). After these missionaries left, they were naturally concerned about how the young church was faring in their absence, especially given Jewish and pagan opposition to the church (Acts 17:5–9; cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:6; 2:14). Timothy eventually traveled to Thessalonica to encourage the church in the faith (3:1–6; cf. comment on 3:1–3a). Once Timothy rejoined Paul and Silvanus, this letter was penned with joy for the church's continued progress in the gospel (3:6–10). Much of the letter encourages these believers to stay true to the good news. Timothy may also have brought back some particular questions from the congregation, to which this epistle responds (e.g., 4:13; 5:1). It is likely that 1 Thessalonians was written while Paul and his colleagues were still in Corinth, during Paul's second missionary journey. The approximate date would then be around AD 50–52.

<span id="page-260-7"></span><span id="page-260-6"></span>Thessalonica's strategic location for commerce and communications, combined with a Jewish presence in the city, made it a natural place for Paul and his team to minister. It was the most populous city in Macedonia (Strabo, *Geographica* 7.7.4), being located on a major Roman road (the Via Egnatia) and at a prosperous harbor on the Thermaean Gulf. Thessalonica was the provincial capital and had been designated a Roman "free city," with corresponding rights to limited self-government. In addition to citizen assemblies and the city council, "politarchs" headed the local government (cf. Acts 17:6, 8 and ancient inscriptions).

<span id="page-260-3"></span>Since a modern metropolis rests atop the ancient remains of Thessalonica, only limited archaeological work has been conducted. However, excavations have unearthed a Roman forum, with its *odeum* (small theater) and *cryptoporticus* (vaulted passageways below the forum). Acts 17 records the presence of a Jewish synagogue in the town, and a couple of key Samaritan and Jewish inscriptions substantiate Jewish habitation. Nonetheless, the first-century city was firmly in the grip of Greco-Roman paganism. Statuary of various gods and other figures from ancient Thessalonica has been unearthed, depicting such gods and goddesses as Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, Demeter, Hermes, and Dionysius as well as such heroes as Asklepios, Herakles, and Cabiros. The archaeological record also testifies to the presence of mystery religions (including worship of Isis and Mithras) and of the Roman imperial cult. Amid this religious climate, the fledgling church likely felt overwhelmed.

### *Genre and Literary Features*

This epistle shares many features in common with other first-century letters. It designates authors and recipients, opens with a thanksgiving, and ends with a formal conclusion. Yet Paul, as in all his letters, has modified standard Greco-Roman epistolary techniques to missionary and theological purposes (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:1–2).

<span id="page-261-11"></span><span id="page-261-9"></span><span id="page-261-4"></span><span id="page-261-2"></span><span id="page-261-0"></span>The opening thanksgiving (1:2–10) contains theological affirmation and personal encouragement. Paul's thought flows in a continuous fashion through chapters 1–3. Note how the ESV begins each paragraph in 2:1–3:13 with a word linking that paragraph to the preceding material (e.g., "for" in 2:1, 9; "and" in 2:13; "but" in 2:17; "therefore" in 3:1; "but" in 3:6; and "now" in 3:11). These paragraphs in 2:1–3:13 should thus be viewed not as clearly marked divisions but as transitions along a continual narrative of how Paul and his colleagues share their ministerial affection and concern with the Thessalonians.

<span id="page-261-16"></span><span id="page-261-15"></span><span id="page-261-14"></span><span id="page-261-13"></span>After the benediction of 3:11–13, a new section begins at 4:1 with the word "finally." This section (4:1–5:22) covers various admonitions, also responding to issues in the Thessalonian church. Starting with an exhortation to conduct life in a way pleasing to God (4:1), Paul forbids sexual immorality—an area of great temptation in Roman society (4:2–8). Then the Pauline admonitions switch to affirming brotherly love and good conduct toward outsiders (4:9–12). Paul turns in 4:13–5:11 to address two questions involving the return of Christ. A series of final admonitions (5:12–22) brings the reader to the closing benediction (5:23–24), concluding directives (5:25–27), and Paul's final pronouncement of grace (5:28).

### <span id="page-261-19"></span><span id="page-261-18"></span><span id="page-261-17"></span>*Theology of 1 Thessalonians*

Paul's letters typically spring not from abstract theological ramblings but from the precise needs of the churches to whom he writes. This is especially evident in 1 Thessalonians, since Paul and his team are writing to a young congregation that requires further instruction (3:10). This is missionary theology, connecting the gospel to the life of this particular congregation.

<span id="page-261-12"></span><span id="page-261-7"></span><span id="page-261-3"></span><span id="page-261-1"></span>Many typical Pauline theological emphases are found here: reference to the threefold deity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (1:2–6); the high Christology implied in the lordship of Christ (cf. comments on 3:11; also on 1:1, 8–10); the saving message of the gospel of Christ (1:5, 8; 2:8–9); Jesus' death for us (4:14; 5:10); Jesus' resurrection from the dead (1:10; 4:14); and Jesus' return to judge the world and establish his kingdom (1:10; 4:13–5:11).

<span id="page-261-10"></span><span id="page-261-8"></span><span id="page-261-6"></span><span id="page-261-5"></span>Paul knows that the grace of God transforms these believers' lives (1:1; 5:28). In particular, God chose and elected these believers unto salvation (1:4), and they accordingly responded in saving faith (1:3, 8; 2:13; 3:5–7; 5:8–10). Christians are in the process of sanctification in this life (2:12; 4:1–3; 5:23–24), awaiting the glory of the world to come. Good works do not save, but obedience is the proper result of a salvation that is active in the believer's life. The church must persevere <span id="page-262-5"></span>together, enduring the afflictions of this life, especially opposition to the gospel (1:6; 2:13–16; 3:2–5, 8; 5:11).

<span id="page-262-10"></span><span id="page-262-7"></span>The most studied theological contribution of 1 Thessalonians involves its teaching on the end times (eschatology), beginning with the opening thanksgiving (1:10; also 2:19; 3:13). Paul addresses two key eschatological questions: Will the dead in Christ be raised (4:13–18)? When will Christ return (5:1–11)? To the first question, Paul responds with a definitive yes, stating that the Christian dead will be raised prior to all believers' meeting the Lord as he comes to establish his kingdom fully. Regarding the second question, Paul discourages speculation, since the return of Christ will occur at an unexpected moment (5:2).

<span id="page-262-13"></span><span id="page-262-6"></span>Modern theologians tend to distinguish between theology and ethics, but for Paul these form a seamless whole: good theology necessitates proper ethics. Among Paul's typical ethical instruction, we find emphasis in 1 Thessalonians on the *imitatio* theme: Paul imitates Christ, and churches imitate Paul's model as well as one another's (1:6–10; cf. comment on 1:6). Paul's many admonitions provide ethical norms, with a particular emphasis in this letter on sexual fidelity amid a perverse Greco-Roman society (4:3–8). There is also an emphasis on prayer (1:2; 3:10; 5:17, 25) and on diligent work in the Christian life (1:3; 4:11–12; 5:14). Love and hope are key dimensions of sanctification (1:4; 3:6, 12; 4:9–10). This book also provides a profound model of ministry and missions (esp. 2:1–12).

### <span id="page-262-8"></span><span id="page-262-4"></span><span id="page-262-3"></span><span id="page-262-2"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-262-11"></span>Multiple connections exist between this letter and the rest of Paul's writings (note cross-references throughout this commentary). Paul derives his teaching from two principal sources: the OT Scriptures and Jesus' ministry. The impact of Jesus' teaching is perhaps most overt in Paul's eschatological instruction, which he received by a "word from the Lord" and which is clearly indebted to Jesus' Olivet Discourse (cf. comments on 4:15; 4:16; 5:1). One of the book's theological complexities arises from studying the correlations and distinctives in its end-times teaching in comparison with other biblical eschatological passages (e.g., Matthew 24; 2 Thess. 1:5–2:12; 2 Pet. 3:1–13; the book of Revelation).

### <span id="page-262-14"></span><span id="page-262-0"></span>*Preaching from 1 Thessalonians*

Preachers often gravitate toward passages with clear statements of the gospel or with overt directives for Christian growth. This can cause us to overlook the many other ways in which Paul's epistles instruct ministers and their congregations. Note in 1 Thessalonians that imperatives are found only toward the end of the book (from 4:18 to 5:26), yet Christian encouragement and ethical instruction is evident throughout chapters 1–4.

<span id="page-262-12"></span><span id="page-262-9"></span><span id="page-262-1"></span>Paul's *imitatio* theme ("imitate me, as I imitate Christ") enables us to realize that many of his first-person references provide models of Christian living and ministry (esp. 2:1–12; 2:17–3:10). Thus, when Paul repeatedly refers to the church with great affection, we recognize a pattern for loving Christian ministry—one <span id="page-263-1"></span>that preachers can follow in their lives and messages and one that serves as an example for all in the church. Paul considers it important not only that the gospel is preached, but that it is preached with good motives and with an earnest sacrificial desire to benefit its hearers (e.g., 2:3–12). Similarly, just as the Pauline churches grew in Christ by imitating one another, so we also find helpful encouragement in the Thessalonian church's model of endurance, faith, and love (e.g., 2:13–14).

<span id="page-263-2"></span>The preacher can also be encouraged by Paul's approach to the complex theological topic of eschatology. Paul, following Jesus' example, steadfastly refuses to speculate as to when precisely Christ will return; instead, he prompts the church to be ready. Paul conveys eschatological truths primarily to comfort the church in the knowledge of Jesus' resurrection and return.

### *Interpretive Challenges*

<span id="page-263-0"></span>Three key interpretive challenges are evident among modern commentators. First, given the sequence of historical events in Paul's second missionary journey, scholars debate when in the timeline of Acts 17 Timothy returned to Thessalonica in order to encourage the church (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 3:1–3a).

<span id="page-263-3"></span>Second, in view of the complexity of understanding OT and NT prophecy, it is not surprising that interpreters ponder the relationship of the end-times material in 1 Thessalonians (esp. 4:13–5:11) to other NT eschatological passages.

<span id="page-263-4"></span>Third, some scholars contend that the epistle follows an ancient rhetorical structure, implying that a central argument drives the entire letter. Paul does employ rhetorical and epistolary devices on the micro-scale. However, contradictory scholarly proposals cause us to question whether the whole letter follows an obvious rhetorical arrangement. Moreover, it seems reductionistic to constrain the letter to a single overarching argument.

### <span id="page-265-0"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 1:1–10

1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

Grace to you and peace.

**<sup>2</sup>**We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly*<sup>1</sup>* mentioning you in our prayers, **<sup>3</sup>** remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. **4**For we know, brothers*<sup>2</sup>* loved by God, that he has chosen you, **<sup>5</sup>**because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. **6**And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, **<sup>7</sup>** so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. **8**For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. **9**For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, **<sup>10</sup>** and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.

1Or *without ceasing* 2Or *brothers and sisters*. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word *adelphoi* (translated "brothers") may refer either to *brothers* or to *brothers and sisters*

### *Section Overview*

Roman letters commonly began by stating the author(s) and recipients, often following this greeting with a thanksgiving for the recipients. Paul regularly opens his church letters in this manner, yet he carefully constructs each greeting and thanksgiving to conform to the ministerial needs of the particular church to which he is writing. Themes in 1:1–10 continue into subsequent chapters of 1 Thessalonians. Notably, the manner in which the gospel came to the Thessalonians (1:5) receives extended attention in 2:1–12, while the fruitful response among them (1:6–10) is again lauded in 2:13–16. Verse 13 of chapter 2 returns to a Pauline thanksgiving in words parallel to 1:2.

<span id="page-265-4"></span><span id="page-265-3"></span><span id="page-265-2"></span><span id="page-265-1"></span>The authors are identified as Paul and his missionary colleagues Silvanus and Timothy. The Thessalonians, to whom they are writing, have only recently become converts to Christ, but Paul's missionary team had been compelled by local opposition to leave Thessalonica shortly after these believers responded to the gospel. Paul is seeking continued contact with them, and he wishes to encourage them

<span id="page-266-5"></span><span id="page-266-4"></span><span id="page-266-3"></span>in their faith by means of this extended thanksgiving section (vv. 2–10). Paul admires their continued Christian diligence, which springs from their faith, love, and hope in Christ (v. 3). And Paul expresses confidence that the Lord has elected and saved them (v. 4), based on how the gospel came to them (v. 5) and how they responded (vv. 6–10).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-266-9"></span><span id="page-266-2"></span>1:1 Paul's letters typically begin with a statement of author and audience, followed by an opening greeting and thanksgiving. This opening is largely identical to 2 Thessalonians 1:1–2, though 2 Thessalonians extends the greeting of "grace to you and peace" to include "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."1

<span id="page-266-7"></span>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy are listed as coauthors of the epistle, and most of the first-person references in the letter are indeed plural. However, the epistle shifts into first-person singular at three key moments ("I" in 2:18; 3:5; 5:27), indicating Paul's special role in penning the letter (esp. 2:18; cf. Introduction: Author).

<span id="page-266-1"></span><span id="page-266-0"></span>It is worth remembering how the church in Thessalonica was founded. Acts 17:1–10 records that Paul and his team traveled to Thessalonica and presented the gospel in the synagogue. Some synagogue members believed in Christ, but eventually the jealousy of the Jewish community was roused, leading to a confrontation before the city authorities. Paul and Silas were compelled to leave town (Acts 17:10). Given the inadequate time they had to instruct the church in the faith, Paul was concerned about how the church was faring. So it was out of love and missionary concern that Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy were writing to these recent converts in Thessalonica, in order to build them up in the faith.

This epistle employs the Latinized name Silvanus rather than Silas, the Greek equivalent found in Acts. This may be a missional way of connecting with the Thessalonians' Roman identity, since their city had been re-founded as a Roman colony. Paul's name already sounded native in both Latin and Greek.

<span id="page-266-8"></span>As in other letters, Paul identifies these believers as participants in the assembly or "church" (Gk. *ekklēsia*), which had been established "in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 3:11). This reminds readers of their collective special relationship to God, since God is their "Father" due to the work

<sup>1</sup> Many Greek manuscripts of 1 Thessalonians later added a similar "from" phrase, due to copyists' imitating 2 Thessalonians.

<span id="page-267-1"></span>of Jesus and the Spirit (cf. Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:4–7). Paul also recalls the titles of Jesus, who is the fulfillment of OT messianic expectations ("Christ") and is rightly worshiped as "Lord," since Jesus indeed rules over all creation as God the Son.

At the outset of his letters, Paul commonly invokes God's "grace" and "peace" on the recipients. Perhaps Paul's greeting of "peace" was derived from the Jewish use of *shalom* (Hb. for "peace") in salutations. The Greek word for "grace" (*charis*) sounds similar to the normal Greek greeting (*charein*—"hello" or "rejoice"), but with an important theological shift to recognizing God as the giver of all good things to his people.

<span id="page-267-4"></span>1:2 Paul typically follows his epistolary greetings with a thanksgiving and prayer on behalf of the recipients. Often these consist of a single long Greek sentence. Since Greek in Paul's day was written without punctuation, there is a question of whether the Greek sentence that begins in this verse actually concludes at the end of verse 5 or perhaps (as suggested below) at the end of verse 10.

<span id="page-267-8"></span><span id="page-267-5"></span>Paul gratefully recounts how God brought the Thessalonians to this point in their Christian experience. Such a prayer also serves as an indirect way for Paul to commend the congregation for their faithfulness. Structurally in Greek, the main verb is "we give thanks," which is modified by three participial phrases in verses 2–4 ("mentioning," "remembering," and "knowing"). "Mentioning" in 1:2 is more literally "making remembrance" in the Greek. Combined with "remembering" in 1:3, this places a heavy emphasis on how Paul's memory of the church in Thessalonica pours forth into expressions of thanksgiving on their behalf.

Also notable are the expressions of frequency and the extent of Paul's prayers: "always," "all of you," and "constantly." This indicates that, as often as Paul prays for the Thessalonians (i.e., frequently!), he gives thanks for them. Paul remembers these believers with fond affection and intense thanksgiving. Such words would have been deeply encouraging to this young church in Thessalonica.

<span id="page-267-6"></span>1:3 Paul's thanksgiving prayer here recalls, "before our God and Father," three responses to the gospel among the Thessalonian church: "work," "labor," and "steadfastness." This overlapping vocabulary emphasizes how the Thessalonians diligently lived out their Christian calling. Their Christian experience overflowed in dutiful response to the God who had graciously saved them, as was evidenced in their perseverance.

<span id="page-267-3"></span><span id="page-267-2"></span>Note also how the work/labor/steadfastness triad is connected to a triad of faith/love/hope common elsewhere in Paul (1 Thess. 5:8; also 1 Cor. 13:13; Gal. 5:5–6; Col. 1:4–5). The connection between "steadfastness" and "hope" is certainly intentional, since Paul elsewhere demonstrates how Christian hope and confidence in the Lord's return leads to perseverance amid the trials of this life (e.g., Rom. 5:2–5; 8:24–25). Similarly, their faith and love also issues forth into good works and labor in the Lord.

<span id="page-267-7"></span><span id="page-267-0"></span>One other Pauline triad is worth observing in 1 Thessalonians 1:3–5. Across these verses, Paul references all three persons of the Trinity: "our God and Father," "our Lord Jesus Christ," and "the Holy Spirit." The Trinitarian participation in the Thessalonians' response to the gospel gives Paul confidence in their salvation.

<span id="page-268-11"></span><span id="page-268-6"></span><span id="page-268-5"></span>1:4 Paul's thankfulness also flows from his assurance of the Thessalonians' election. The English ("for we know") translates a Greek participle (*eidotes*, "knowing") that provides the cause for the authors' thanksgiving in 1:2. The authors have confidence in the salvation of the Thessalonians, considering it clear that God has elected them to be included among God's people (cf. also 2 Thess. 2:13–14). Paul does not provide a detailed doctrine of election in this verse, though he talks more about election and its cognate terms in passages such as Romans 8:33; 9:11; 11:5–7; Colossians 3:12; 2 Timothy 2:10; and Titus 1:1. For Paul, election entails God's calling and predestining of the elect to salvation and to adoption into God's family (Rom. 8:28–39; Eph. 1:3–14).

<span id="page-268-4"></span><span id="page-268-3"></span><span id="page-268-2"></span><span id="page-268-1"></span>Perhaps it is out of this certainty of their adoption that Paul refers to these Thessalonians as "brothers" in Christ who have been "loved by God." Paul often refers to Christians as brothers and sisters—more than a hundred times in his letters, and over twenty times in 1 and 2 Thessalonians alone. Familial language affords an endearing way to speak of fellow believers. Paul also frequently mentions God's love for believers (e.g., Rom. 1:7; 5:8; Eph. 2:4), connecting such love with God's initiating the salvation of his beloved people (2 Thess. 2:13, 16).

<span id="page-268-10"></span><span id="page-268-7"></span><span id="page-268-0"></span>1:5 Paul further discusses God's saving election of the Thessalonians, emphasizing in this verse how the gospel came to them (with power, the Holy Spirit, and deep conviction).

One key question in verse 5 concerns the identity of those who have "full conviction" in Paul's presentation of the gospel; does the phrase describe Paul, or the Thessalonians? Before answering that question, observe that the Greek word ( *plērophoria*) translated "conviction" here refers to a state of complete confidence and assurance. Also hidden in the Greek is another word ( *pollē*, meaning "much," not translated in English) that further emphasizes such absolute confidence.

Now to answer the preceding question: The period after "full conviction" could be misleading, since the Greek here includes the word *kathōs* ("just as"), which (although not translated in the ESV) indicates a continuation of the previous thought. Thus the NASB translates, "just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake." Because of this "just as" clause, it is best to understand the whole of verse 5 as representing the presentation side (i.e., Paul's side) of the gospel's coming to Thessalonica (cf. 2:1–12).

<span id="page-268-9"></span><span id="page-268-8"></span>Paul knows that the gospel message came to the Thessalonians just as it should have, granting Paul confidence that the message had hit its mark. When Paul and his team presented the good news to the Thessalonians, their communication came with demonstrations of the gospel's power, with the Holy Spirit invigorating their presentation, and with absolute confidence that the gospel is true. Moreover, verses 6–10 will demonstrate that the Thessalonians also responded amazingly well, further assuring Paul of their salvation.

<span id="page-269-3"></span><span id="page-269-2"></span>1:6 While English translations usually end verse 5 with a period, verse 6 in the Greek continues the thought of verses 1–5. Note how verse 6 begins with "And," linking it with the preceding material. Verse 6 thus further describes components of Paul's knowledge of the Thessalonians' election and salvation.

<span id="page-269-6"></span>While verse 5 focuses on how the Pauline team presented the good news to the Thessalonians, verses 6–10 recall the response of the Thessalonian church. They turned to God from idols, imitated Christ (and Paul), became an example to other churches, and continued to await Christ's return. The magnitude of that response grants Paul even greater certainty of their election and salvation.

<span id="page-269-1"></span>Commentators often refer to the imitation theme in Paul's letters (e.g., 1 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 5:1; Phil. 3:17), which is most succinctly stated in 1 Corinthians 11:1 ("Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ"). Paul models his behavior on Christ, and thus believers who imitate Paul are also following his model of Christ-like behavior. This theme surfaces repeatedly in Paul's communication with the Thessalonians (cf. 1 Thess. 2:14; 2 Thess. 3:7, 9). In this context, Paul remarks that the Thessalonians have already become imitators of Paul's team and thus imitators of the Lord Jesus himself.

<span id="page-269-8"></span><span id="page-269-0"></span>Just as Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy had endured much persecution (cf. Acts 16:19–24, 37–40; 17:5–10, 13–14), so have the Thessalonians already endured much "affliction" for the sake of the gospel. After the good news came to them, suffering and persecution arrived hard on its heels (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:14). Not only did the Thessalonians endure such persecution, they did so "with the joy" that comes from the Holy Spirit (1:6). Earthly explanations do not suffice for understanding their joy amid opposition. Clearly the Spirit was present among them.

<span id="page-269-5"></span>Thus Paul remains confident in the believers' salvation and election because, though a young church, they have already become imitators of Paul and Jesus. Even from the earliest days of their receiving the gospel, the Thessalonians have endured persecution with the joy that comes from the Spirit.

<span id="page-269-7"></span>1:7 Such a wonderful response to the gospel among the Thessalonians has led further to their serving as an example for others.

"Macedonia and . . . Achaia" includes most of modern Greece, from the north in Philippi to the southern regions of Athens and Corinth. Thessalonica was the provincial capital in Macedonia. Paul likely writes from Corinth in Achaia, and thus he knows that the churches in the entire region from Philippi to Corinth look to the Thessalonian church as a model of receptivity to the gospel.

<span id="page-269-9"></span><span id="page-269-4"></span>The Greek word for "example" (*typos*) is employed also by Paul in other epistles, in which he encourages churches to follow the faithful model of other believers (e.g., Phil. 3:17; 2 Thess. 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12; Titus 2:7). Thus there is this *imitatio* chain: Christ is imitated by Paul and his team; they are then imitated by the Thessalonian church; and other churches follow the example of the Thessalonians. And this, just to reiterate the theme of 1 Thessalonians 1:5–10, grants Paul further evidence of the church's salvation and election.

<span id="page-270-16"></span><span id="page-270-14"></span>1:8–10 These verses unpack what was said succinctly in verse 7. The way the Thessalonians have become an example to other churches is at least twofold: they have participated in the spread of the gospel, and their faithfulness to God has become well known.

<span id="page-270-0"></span>Concerning the spread of the gospel from the Thessalonian church, the "word of the Lord" has "sounded forth." The "word of the Lord" is an OT phrase for the speech of God himself—in creation, in covenantal lawgiving, and in prophetic ministry (e.g., Ex. 4:28; Ps. 33:4, 6; Jer. 1:4; etc.). In the NT, this same phrase indicates gospel truths about Jesus, which derive ultimately from Jesus' own words about himself (e.g., Acts 13:44–49; 15:35–36; 2 Thess. 3:1). In this epistle, "the word of the Lord" is used interchangeably with "the word of God" (1 Thess. 2:13) and "gospel" (1:5; 2:4).

<span id="page-270-19"></span><span id="page-270-15"></span><span id="page-270-12"></span><span id="page-270-7"></span>The gospel has resounded from the Thessalonians—not only in the regions already mentioned by Paul in verse 7 (Macedonia and Greece) but "everywhere" (1:8). This undoubtedly represents some hyperbole, but Paul is pleased that churches around the Mediterranean have all heard positive things about the Thessalonians. Paul indicates that this encouraging report about the Thessalonians' reputation has to do both with their past (their "reception" of Paul's team and the gospel message) and with their present (how they continue to "wait" for Christ's return).

<span id="page-270-10"></span>Not only had the Thessalonians become imitators of Paul, enduring persecution for the sake of the gospel, but they also showed a radical transformation in their religious allegiance. From a Roman perspective, it was shocking that these church members had repudiated their idols. However, these believers had rightly discovered that idols represented worthless false deities (e.g., 1 Cor. 8:4–6; cf. 1 Chron. 16:26–27; Pss. 31:6; 115:4–8; Rev. 9:20). In contrast, the Christian God is "living and true" (1 Thess. 1:9). Paul's mention of former idol worshipers among the Thessalonian community implies that, in addition to Jewish converts in their midst (Acts 17:4), a number of Gentile believers had joined the church.

<span id="page-270-18"></span><span id="page-270-17"></span><span id="page-270-8"></span><span id="page-270-4"></span><span id="page-270-3"></span><span id="page-270-2"></span><span id="page-270-1"></span>In the present age, the Thessalonians, like all believers, await the return of the Lord Jesus. The return of Christ forms an important theme in this epistle (1 Thess. 4:13–5:11; 5:23) and in 2 Thessalonians 1:5–2:12. In 1 Thessalonians 1:10, Paul follows Jesus' own teaching about his return (e.g., Matthew 24–25). Jesus will come on the clouds of heaven (1 Thess. 1:10; cf. Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Mark 13:26; 14:62; Luke 21:27), Jesus' resurrection assures us of his lordship and his return to judge the living and the dead (1 Thess. 4:13–18; cf. Acts 10:42; Rom. 1:4; 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:20–28; 2 Cor. 4:14; Eph. 1:19–21), and Jesus' salvation of his faithful followers delivers them from the coming wrath that will be poured out on all of those who do not assent to Christ's lordship (1 Thess. 5:9–11; cf. John 3:36; Rom. 5:6–11; 2 Thess. 1:5–10).

<span id="page-270-13"></span><span id="page-270-11"></span><span id="page-270-9"></span><span id="page-270-6"></span><span id="page-270-5"></span>Thus 1 Thessalonians 1:5–10 presents evidence for Paul's confidence in the election and salvation of the Thessalonians. In verse 5, Paul notes how the gospel was presented to them with power in the Holy Spirit and with full confidence in <span id="page-271-1"></span>its truth. Then, in verses 6–10, Paul spells out how the Thessalonians' response to the good news shows that, even amid persecution, they joyfully received the gospel, turned from idols, became imitators of Christ, and now await his return.

### *Response*

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy model proper missionary and pastoral concern. They had engaged in loving teamwork to bring the gospel to the church in Thessalonica. Now, they publicly thank God for the believers under their care, serving as a reminder to all in ministry that our congregants benefit when ministers express deep, public appreciation to God for everyone in their ministry.

Paul champions this congregation for their diligent labor and perseverance, which springs forth from their faith, love, and hope. This serves to encourage the congregation further in that good response to the gospel of Jesus, inviting all who read the letter, then and now, to allow their hope to overflow into perseverance while their love and faith return diligent service to Christ in all areas of life.

Following Paul's example, ministers should regularly find ways to encourage the Christian diligence of their flock by championing openly how God is at work among them. Paul's words also model an appropriate confidence amid gospel ministry, finding assurance that God is using our ministries to call others to himself by observing how the Spirit enables our ministry and by witnessing the fruitful response of believers in Christ. Paul has much still to correct among the Thessalonians in subsequent chapters. However, those who receive the good news joyfully, who hope in Christ's return, who endeavor to follow Jesus, and who consider persecution worth enduring for Jesus' sake—such believers can find confidence in God's saving grace.

<span id="page-271-3"></span><span id="page-271-2"></span>Paul and his team have just given thanks for the Thessalonians (1:1–10). Now Paul will remind them further of his team's gospel ministry in Thessalonica (2:1–12) and of how the Thessalonians received that gospel (2:13–16). While this affectionate section serves to deepen the relationship between Paul and the Thessalonians, it also models sound Christian ministry and encourages the Thessalonians in their perseverance and Christian growth.

<span id="page-271-4"></span>In 2:17–20, Paul mentions his longing to return to the Thessalonians, partially out of concern for how these young Christians were faring amid the opposition

Instead, Paul sent Timothy, received an encouraging report, and wrote this letter in response (3:1–10). Paul concludes the first half of this epistle with a benediction (3:11–13).

### *Section Overview*

First-century Roman cities were full of traveling philosophers, magicians, and religious enthusiasts who gained their livelihood from public teaching. Ancient literature often associates such teachers with greed and immorality. They amassed wealth and notoriety through their fine-sounding rhetoric. Some happily argued both sides of a debate, indifferent to the truth of the matter. Their teaching could shift according to audience desires. Often they behaved reprehensibly toward others—mocking their opponents, winning over the weak-willed, engaging in sexual relations with followers, and sponging off of the rich.

In this section, Paul persuasively distinguishes his ministry from such people. Paul and his colleagues approached the Thessalonians with love and affection, seeking to please God with their conduct and message. Paul reminds the church of the suffering he and his team were willing to undergo for the sake of the gospel as evidence that they were motivated by God's commissioning them to this task, which they carried out with honest concern for the welfare of the Thessalonians. Both God and the Thessalonians serve as witnesses to how Paul and his team proclaimed the good news boldly without guile, error, or falsehood. Concerning their relationship with the churches, Paul draws analogies both to the affection of motherhood and to the loving instruction of fathers to their children. Paul's goal was to gather those called by God to be his kingdom people and to encourage them to walk in ways worthy of God.

Many have postulated a tone of defensiveness in Paul's words. Some see this passage as key to the whole epistle, since they believe Paul structured the letter as a rhetorical apology for (or defense of) his conduct while in Thessalonica and for why he had not yet returned to visit the church. Some surmise that, after he left, Paul's reputation was being sullied and Paul feared the church would cave in to such attacks. It is certainly the case that, within a few years, Paul would make just such a defense to believers in Corinth (cf. esp. 2 Cor. 10:1–13:10), so it is conceivable that Paul might have needed to do the same here. However, no overt mention of any such attacks on Paul's reputation is found in 1 or 2 Thessalonians, and this paragraph appears too early and too isolated in the epistle for us to conceive of the entire letter as a kind of rhetorical apology.

<span id="page-273-1"></span><span id="page-273-0"></span>It is clear that Paul reminds his audience of his ministry among them for other purposes, especially in order to highlight the truth of the gospel by showing that the gospel messengers brought this good news amid suffering, without false motives but rather with a desire to please God and with a love for the Thessalonians.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-273-3"></span><span id="page-273-2"></span>2:1 Paul again reminds the Thessalonians of how the gospel came to them (cf. 1:5). He emphasizes the Thessalonians' awareness of this history ("you yourselves know"), and he appeals repeatedly in this section to their remembrance of how Paul and his colleagues impeccably conducted ministry while with them.

The opening "for" connects this recollection to the preceding thanksgiving section, indicating that Paul intends to elaborate on his previous reasons for confidence in the salvation of the Thessalonians. His work among them has not come up empty. Yet now the focus shifts more to the integrity of Paul and his colleagues in their gospel mission.

<span id="page-274-12"></span><span id="page-274-8"></span>As before (1:4), Paul mentions his affectionate ties with the church, evident here in his use of "brothers" to describe his relationship to all in the church. Such family language will continue as Paul soon employs both maternal (2:7–8) and paternal (vv. 11–12) imagery.

<span id="page-274-14"></span><span id="page-274-2"></span><span id="page-274-1"></span>2:2 When Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy first arrived in Thessalonica, they had only recently been exiled from Philippi (Acts 16). While in Philippi, they encountered Lydia and others outside the city gate, and many of them became believers (Acts 16:13–15). Subsequent events led to Paul and his colleagues' being charged as Jews committing unlawful religious acts. The Philippian magistrates consequently had Paul and Silas (i.e., Silvanus) beaten and thrown into prison (vv. 19–24). Later, after the miraculous conversion of the jailer and his household (vv. 25–34), the city magistrates learned of Paul's Roman citizenship and were compelled to apologize to him, though they still insisted that he must leave the city (vv. 35–40).

<span id="page-274-5"></span><span id="page-274-4"></span><span id="page-274-3"></span><span id="page-274-0"></span>Paul's reference in 1 Thessalonians to these events focuses on two aspects of his team's reception while in Philippi: their suffering and their shameful treatment. The Greek term for "shamefully treated" appears elsewhere in the NT for physical injury used as a means of mockery and shame (Matt. 22:6; Luke 18:32; Acts 14:5). As Acts makes clear (16:37), Roman law did not permit the public beating of Roman citizens in such circumstances, and such treatment was deemed dishonorable. Thus Paul and Silas received shameful disrespect as well as physical injury.

<span id="page-274-6"></span>In this verse, Paul contrasts these sufferings with their continued boldness in declaring the gospel just a short time later in Thessalonica. This boldness was not self-generated but arose from their relationship to God as bearers of the gospel. Certainly this highlights the respect to be accorded these missionaries and their message. Moreover, it serves as a point of contact between Paul and the Thessalonians, since that church was also undergoing suffering and persecution (1 Thess. 1:6; 2:14). Therefore, Paul and his colleagues serve again as a model of gospel perseverance for the Thessalonians to imitate (1:6).

<span id="page-274-16"></span><span id="page-274-10"></span><span id="page-274-9"></span>The Thessalonians already "know" (2:2) of the suffering Paul and his colleagues endured in Philippi. Paul had likely talked about this with the Thessalonian believers while they were together. In fact, Paul and his colleagues continued to "declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict" (v. 2), alluding to how persecution followed them to Thessalonica and beyond. The Greek word here for "conflict" (*agōn*) is often used as an athletic metaphor (cf. 2 Tim. 4:7; Heb. 12:1) connoting struggle against opposition in order to achieve victory. Paul expresses that he had been emboldened to declare the "gospel of God" (also 1 Thess. 2:8–9; Rom. 15:16; 1 Tim. 1:11), a phrase used interchangeably with his more typical "gospel of Christ" (cf. 1 Thess. 3:2).

<span id="page-274-15"></span><span id="page-274-13"></span><span id="page-274-11"></span><span id="page-274-7"></span>2:3–4 In the first-century Roman Empire, numerous itinerant speakers taught various philosophies and religions. Many famously employed their eloquent speaking skills to convince others, with the purpose of beguiling the populace into giving them money, food, and a place to stay. Others brought medicinal and magical cures or promised to foretell the future. In such a climate, various charlatans and false teachers could even sneak into the church, seeking similar unrighteous gain (e.g., Acts 8:9–24; 2 Cor. 11:12–15). In these and subsequent verses, Paul distinguishes his ministry from such false messengers, lest he be unfairly associated with devious itinerant teachers.

<span id="page-275-15"></span><span id="page-275-10"></span><span id="page-275-9"></span><span id="page-275-1"></span>Already in verse 2, Paul's willingness to declare the gospel amid much persecution has served as evidence of his good character. In verse 3, Paul notes that his team came with an "appeal" (Gk. *paraklēsis*) that did not originate in "error" (Gk. *planē*, meaning a wandering from the truth; cf. James 5:20; 2 Pet. 3:17; 1 John 4:6). Their exhortation also did not derive from impure or unclean motives originating from moral corruption (Gk. *akatharsia*). Finally, Paul and his colleagues did not approach the Thessalonians in guile, with the goal of "deception" (Gk. *dolos*).

<span id="page-275-11"></span>Verse 4 remarks that Paul and his team did not come to please their listeners with a message full of deception and error. Rather, their message came at the pleasure of God. Indeed, Paul's team had been "tested" (Gk. *dokimazō*). God, who can penetrate the motives of human hearts, has verified that these workmen are worthy to be entrusted with the good news of the gospel (cf. Gal. 2:7; 1 Tim. 1:11; Titus 1:3). They are faithful messengers from God himself, and thus they approach their ministry with good motives.

<span id="page-275-14"></span><span id="page-275-12"></span><span id="page-275-8"></span><span id="page-275-7"></span>2:5–6 The Thessalonians themselves can testify to the integrity of Paul's mission. As before (2:1–2), Paul appeals to what the church "knows" about his ministry in Thessalonica. More importantly, God himself stands as "witness" to how Paul and his team conducted their mission (cf. Rom. 1:9; Phil. 1:8).

<span id="page-275-16"></span><span id="page-275-4"></span><span id="page-275-3"></span>Paul contrasts his team's approach with that of itinerant philosophers and teachers, who could employ flattery to deceive their listeners so that they might greedily receive gain and glory from their work (cf. Rom. 16:18; Phil. 3:19; 2 Pet. 2:3). Paul and his colleagues did not utter "words of flattery," nor did their motives stem from "greed." They did not seek "glory" from human sources. Any gain and glory they received from their ministry could come only from God.

<span id="page-275-13"></span><span id="page-275-6"></span><span id="page-275-5"></span><span id="page-275-2"></span><span id="page-275-0"></span>Paul admits that he had a right to receive compensation from his ministry, since he was acting as an apostle of Christ. While writing to the Corinthians, Paul notes that he had the right to receive financial return from those to whom he was ministering, but he refused to burden the church with his financial needs (1 Cor. 9:12, 15; 2 Cor. 11:9; 12:13). Paul insists that ministers of the gospel rightly deserve compensation for their gospel service (1 Cor. 9:8–14; 1 Tim. 5:17–18; cf. Luke 10:7–8). However, Paul gave up these ministerial (and apostolic) rights for the sake of the gospel and for the benefit of the churches. In Corinth and likely in Thessalonica (cf. 2 Thess. 3:7–9; also 1 Thess. 2:9), Paul worked in his trade as a tentmaker (Acts 18:3) and received support from other churches (2 Cor. 11:8–9; Phil. 4:14–16) so that he would not need funds from the church with whom he was staying.

<span id="page-276-8"></span>Through diligent labor, Paul established a strong work ethic among the churches that he will later encourage the Thessalonians to imitate (2 Thess. 3:6–12). This was also undoubtedly a good missionary strategy, as it set Paul and his colleagues apart from the many itinerant preachers who sought ill-gotten gain with false philosophy. In contrast, Paul's team proved themselves to be motivated by God himself, by the truth of their proclamation, and by their love for the Thessalonians.

<span id="page-276-7"></span><span id="page-276-3"></span><span id="page-276-2"></span>2:7–8 Paul and his colleagues go beyond a mere appeal to their own good missional motives (cf. previous comment) by speaking in compassionate and endearing terms to the Thessalonians (cf. also 2:17–20; 3:6–10, 12). Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy compare themselves to nursing mothers with their newborns (2:7) or to fathers among their children (2:11–12). They were "affectionately desirous" of the Thessalonians, sharing their very lives with them (2:8).

<span id="page-276-6"></span><span id="page-276-4"></span>Sometimes people conceive of Paul as the fervent apostle, on the forefront of the gospel battlefield, spreading his message and moving frequently from city to city, yet relatively unconnected to local congregations. Paul was certainly a fervent apostle with a profound message, yet these verses display his love for those to whom he ministered. His mission was deeply rooted in affection for the church. Paul and his colleagues put that love on display for all the church to see. He is not reticent about his fondness for others, and he gladly announces his love for them, in part to motivate their continued faithfulness to the Lord Jesus. Certainly this serves as a wonderful model for all of Christ's ministers.

Verse 7 employs maternal imagery to portray Paul and his colleagues as deeply caring for the welfare of the Thessalonian church.2 Paul speaks of a nurse whose expertise in looking after other people's children now overflows in affection and care for her own children.

<span id="page-276-0"></span>The relationship between verses 7 and 8 is more continuous than the English punctuation might imply. There is a connection between "like" (Gk. *hōs*) in verse 7 and "so" (Gk. *houtōs*) in verse 8 (cf. Rom. 5:18; 2 Cor. 7:14). Therefore, one should read, "Like a nursing mother taking care of her own children, . . . so . . . we were ready to share with you . . . our own selves."

Paul and his colleagues declare that they approached the Thessalonians in order to share of themselves as well as sharing the good news about Jesus. In all of this they were motivated by their "affectionate desire" because these young believers had become dear to these missionaries. The degree of personal commitment from Paul and his missionary friends to the Thessalonian believers is quite remarkable.

<span id="page-276-5"></span><span id="page-276-1"></span>2:9 If in 2:5 Paul wished the church to affirm that he and his team clearly had no greedy motives, now Paul invites them to recall how diligently his team worked while in Thessalonica. Paul is emphatic here. Note the repetition of "work" vocabulary ("labor," "toil," and "worked") and his insistence that they labored both "night

<sup>2</sup> As the ESV margin indicates, in many early Greek manuscripts the word "infants" appears instead of "gentle"—the Greek variation consists of a single letter (*nēpioi* vs. *ēpioi* ). The difference in meaning would be slight, since using "infants" (*nēpioi* ) would convey that their motives were pure and without greed, consistent with verse 5.

<span id="page-277-15"></span>and day." In order not to be a "burden," Paul earned his keep in addition to laboring in his ministry (cf. 2 Thess. 3:8). This again serves as a stark contrast with the many first-century itinerant philosophers, teachers, and religious enthusiasts (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:5–6).

<span id="page-277-11"></span><span id="page-277-9"></span>2:10 The authors appeal both to the Thessalonians' testimony and to God's supreme awareness of their missionary conduct. Three related words are used to emphasize this proper conduct—"holy," "righteous," and "blameless." In sum, Paul and his team, by the grace of God working through them, imitated the character of the holy God as they sought to minister in his name.

<span id="page-277-12"></span><span id="page-277-10"></span><span id="page-277-8"></span>2:11–12 Having already appealed to maternal imagery (2:7–8), Paul now shifts to a paternal analogy, again reminding readers what they "know" of Paul and his team (2:1, 2, 5; cf. vv. 9, 10). Paul and his colleagues behaved like loving fathers do toward their children. Fathers in Jewish and Greek antiquity looked after their children's education and trained them in proper behavior. Paul draws on this imagery, emphasizing their instruction of the Thessalonians by engaging three overlapping terms: "exhorted," "encouraged," and "charged."

<span id="page-277-7"></span><span id="page-277-1"></span><span id="page-277-0"></span>On many occasions Paul employs the metaphor of walking (Gk. *peripateō*) to depict the Christian life (esp. Eph. 4:1; Col. 1:10; 1 Thess. 4:1, 12; also, e.g., Rom. 8:4; 14:15; Gal. 5:16). This conveys an ongoing effort to pursue a certain path with endurance. The metaphor occurs frequently in the OT (e.g., Pss. 1:1; 119:1; Prov. 2:20) and can even be found in pagan Roman thought. Paul's specific exhortation here is for the Christian to proceed through life in a manner that God would endorse.

<span id="page-277-14"></span><span id="page-277-3"></span><span id="page-277-2"></span>God sets the worthy standard of Christian living, and he empowers Christians from the beginning through "calling" them (cf. Rom. 8:30; 1 Thess. 4:7; 5:24; 2 Thess. 2:14) in election to participate in his own "kingdom and glory." "Glory" refers to the marvelous weightiness and wonder of God's presence and being. Christians are privileged to participate in this glory of God (Rom. 8:21; 1 Cor. 2:7). Paul elsewhere follows Jesus' regular idiom concerning the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 4:20; Col. 4:11; 2 Tim. 4:1), especially focusing on the coming eternal rule of God in Christ (1 Cor. 6:9–10; 15:24, 50), which is the inheritance of Christ's followers (2 Thess. 1:5).

<span id="page-277-13"></span><span id="page-277-6"></span><span id="page-277-5"></span><span id="page-277-4"></span>In sum, Paul reminds the Thessalonians of God's electing call that leads them into his kingdom and glory. Such a calling imposes a proper response that involves following God's ways. Paul, like a father exhorting his children, encourages the church to live accordingly.

### *Response*

At some level, all Christians engage in ministry as Spirit-gifted members of the Christian community, encouraging others and witnessing to the world. Thus we all can identify with Paul's approach to missional service as a model to be followed. The character of gospel witness is important to Paul, since young believers will be better established in the good news if they have appropriate respect for those

who brought it to them. Additionally, Paul often invites the churches to imitate him as he imitates Christ, so that others will live in holy and blameless conduct in response to the gospel.

In Christian ministry, the messenger ought to embody and present the gospel message in a worthy manner. Paul illustrates the importance of this, contrasting it with how others in his day might have abused their audiences. Sadly, in today's church there are those who promulgate erroneous notions of God, encourage false ethics, or seek to add to their personal wealth by expanding their audience. In contrast, we do well to conduct our ministry before God, endeavoring at all times to testify to the gospel with holy, righteous, and blameless conduct.

Paul also models a ministry of boldness. Even amid adversity to the gospel, whether in physical suffering or in shame, Paul does not hesitate to stay true to his Lord. This too should be the calling for all who seek to please God, heedless of human approval or disapproval.

Yet Paul's gospel boldness overflows with a compassionate affection for those in his charge. Like a mother, he yearns for the church, loving and caring for them all. Like a father, he lovingly instructs them in the truths of gospel life. It is certainly possible for us, amid the pressures and frustrations of life, to lose sight of how important it is for our love for the people in our ministries to be apparent in how we serve them.

### *Section Overview*

Paul and his colleagues return to a thankful recollection of how the Thessalonians embraced the truth of God's gospel and also imitated the Christian conduct of

other churches. This even entailed suffering, likely in part due to Jewish opposition to the Christian message. Such opposition prompts comment from Paul, who, in ways similar to the OT prophets, expresses frustration that most of his Jewish countrymen have rejected the messianic good news.

### *Section Outline*

III.B. How the Thessalonians Responded and Endured (2:13–16)

- 1. The Thessalonians Respond (2:13–14a)
- 2. Jewish Opposition to the Gospel (2:14b–16)

<span id="page-279-2"></span>2:13 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy again proclaim their thanksgiving to God for the Thessalonian church, returning to themes from the beginning of the letter (esp. 1:6–10). Such thanksgiving is made "without ceasing" (ESV mg.; cf. 1:2 ESV mg.). Paul refers to the gospel as the "word of God" (Rom. 9:6; Col. 1:25; 2 Tim. 2:9; Titus 2:5). He thus contrasts any message of human origin ("word of men") with the gospel, which originated from God. Though God makes his gospel known through human agents, the message itself is firmly rooted in God's own revelation in Christ.

<span id="page-279-9"></span><span id="page-279-6"></span>In Greek, the concluding relative clause in 1 Thessalonians 2:13 ("which is at work in you believers") could refer either to the "word" of God (thus translated "*which* is at work . . .") or to God himself ("*who* is at work . . ."). The question of whether "God" works or his "word" does rests on a fine distinction, since clearly God works through his word in the lives of believers. The mention of "believers" here is certainly intentional. Paul is renowned for his focus on faith as the proper response to God's grace, which brings someone into true Christian fellowship with God. Thus "believers" are those to whom God has given faith in Christ, which leads them to trust him in all of life (also 1 Thess. 1:7; 2:10).

<span id="page-279-7"></span><span id="page-279-5"></span><span id="page-279-4"></span><span id="page-279-3"></span>2:14 Paul alludes again to a central theme in his Christian ethics: imitation. Christians are to imitate Christ, but they also learn how to follow Christ from observing how other Christians imitate Christ (cf. comments on 1:6–7). Paul earlier commended the Thessalonians for serving as a model for other churches (1:7–10). Here the Thessalonians, as they follow Christ amid suffering and persecution, are said to imitate believers in Judea, the very birthplace of Christian faith.

<span id="page-279-8"></span>Paul has heard a report from Timothy that the persecuted Thessalonians are standing fast, which gives him cause for thanksgiving (cf. 1 Thess. 3:8–9). Here in chapter 2, Paul specifically mentions that the church's sufferings are at the hands of their "own countrymen," indicating a concerted local opposition to the church.

<span id="page-279-1"></span><span id="page-279-0"></span>Paul compares their suffering to the Jewish persecution of the Judean church. Notably, Jewish persecution was evident also at the founding of the Thessalonian church, when synagogue leaders out of jealousy raised a rabble to attack Paul (Acts 17:5–9). This mob failed to catch Paul, but they ransacked the house of Jason, dragging him and other Christians before the city authorities. Even after Paul and his company slipped away from Thessalonica to Berea, Thessalonian Jews pursued Paul, forcing him to leave the province of Macedonia altogether (Acts 17:13–14).

It seems likely that such opponents of the gospel in Thessalonica, not content with Paul's dismissal, would have continued to oppose the church that Paul left behind.

<span id="page-280-20"></span><span id="page-280-15"></span><span id="page-280-14"></span><span id="page-280-8"></span><span id="page-280-5"></span>2:15–16 Paul speaks further of Jewish opposition to the gospel, both in Judea and elsewhere. Paul's concerns here do not spring from anti-Semitism, especially since Paul elsewhere identifies with, and shows compassion and concern for, his fellow Jewish countrymen (e.g., Rom. 11:1–2). Even though Paul self-identified as the "apostle to the Gentiles" (Rom. 11:13; also Gal. 2:8–9; 1 Tim. 2:7), he typically went first to the synagogue in each city he visited (Acts 13:14; 14:1; 17:1–3, 10, 17; 18:4, 19; 19:8). In the synagogue Paul proclaimed the Messiah Jesus in keeping with his statement that the gospel is "to the Jew first" (Rom. 1:16). Paul desired that the success of his Gentile ministry might call his Jewish countrymen to worship Jesus the Messiah (Rom. 11:13–16). Indeed, Gentile believers are "grafted in" to Israel as God's people (Rom. 11:17), and it is this renewed Israel of believing Jews and Gentiles that will be saved (Rom. 11:17–32).

<span id="page-280-18"></span><span id="page-280-17"></span><span id="page-280-16"></span><span id="page-280-13"></span><span id="page-280-11"></span><span id="page-280-10"></span><span id="page-280-9"></span><span id="page-280-7"></span><span id="page-280-6"></span>However, Paul also remembers that, on virtually every occasion when he delivered the messianic good news in these synagogues, he eventually faced great opposition (in Pisidian Antioch [Acts 13:45–51]; in Iconium [14:2–6]; in Lystra [14:19]; in Thessalonica [17:5]; in Berea [17:13–14]; in Corinth [18:6, 12–17]; and later in Ephesus [19:9]). Eventually this culminated in Paul's imprisonment and in Jewish attempts to have him put to death (Acts 21–25). Paul invariably met with a mixed response among his Jewish countrymen, with some believing in Jesus but others refusing to do so (e.g., Acts 28:24). Such a negative reception reminds Paul of how Judah and Israel responded to the OT prophets. Amid the prophets' calls for Israel to repent, those prophets typically experienced social ostracism and even death (cf. Acts 28:25–28; Rom. 11:7–10). Jesus himself warned that the church would be persecuted, much in the way the OT prophets had been (e.g., Matt. 5:11–12; 23:29–39). The Messiah himself was rejected by his own people (e.g., Luke 23:13–24; 24:20; Acts 2:23; 13:27–28; cf. John 1:11). In Acts, the young Saul (later Paul) heard Stephen utter a message about Jewish persecution of the OT prophets and of Christ's followers (Acts 7:39–43; 7:51–8:1). Moreover, Paul remembers a time when, prior to God's gracious intervention, he too was a persecutor of the church (Acts 8:3; Gal. 1:13–14; Phil. 3:6).

<span id="page-280-19"></span><span id="page-280-12"></span><span id="page-280-4"></span><span id="page-280-3"></span><span id="page-280-2"></span><span id="page-280-1"></span><span id="page-280-0"></span>All of this serves as the background to Paul's strong statements of condemnation of his fellow Jewish countrymen in 1 Thessalonians 2:14–16. Paul's denunciation follows the pattern of an OT prophet, who would censure his people even while longing for their repentance and return to the Lord. By condemning the Lord Messiah to death and opposing his agents, unbelieving Jews have invoked divine displeasure. In attempting to thwart Paul in his role as apostle to the Gentiles, they "oppose all mankind" by hindering the word of salvation from coming to all humanity. In this way, Paul concludes they are "[filling up] the measure of their sins" through disavowal of God's messengers, just as their forefathers had done to the OT prophets (2:16; cf. Matt. 23:32).

<span id="page-281-6"></span><span id="page-281-5"></span>Such opposition to the Messiah of God rightly deserves God's wrath (cf. also 2 Thess. 1:5–10), and Paul recognizes that this indeed is the result, so he exclaims, "But wrath has come upon them at last!" (1 Thess. 2:16). The tense of this verb ("has come") has led commentators to speculate concerning which specific moment of "wrath" Paul references. Were there certain events in Paul's day, prior to the writing of this letter, to which Paul was referring? Since the Roman suppression of the First Jewish Revolt occurred later (AD 66–73), some suggest Paul alludes to an earlier humiliation of the Jews—perhaps through some imperial edict (such as Claudius's expulsion of Jews from Rome just prior to the writing of this letter; cf. Acts 18:2) or some local judgment of the Jews in Thessalonica or Corinth (e.g., Acts 18:14–17). However, the Greek aorist tense can at times be used to refer with extra certainty to the prophetic future, and Paul's mention of "at last" in verse 16 may refer to wrath at the final judgment (1 Thess. 1:10; 5:9; also Rom. 2:5; Eph. 5:6; Col. 3:6). Regardless of whether "wrath" here refers to the prophetic future or to a particular event in Paul's day, Paul reminds the Thessalonians that God brings justice in the end.

<span id="page-281-4"></span><span id="page-281-3"></span><span id="page-281-2"></span><span id="page-281-1"></span><span id="page-281-0"></span>Throughout this discourse in 1 Thessalonians 2:14–16, Paul identifies with the Thessalonians' emotions in times of persecution. He assures them that in the end the Lord will deal out just retribution to their opponents. He provides a broader context for Jewish opposition to the gospel, illustrating that such responses have long been encountered in the history of God's dealings with Israel. And he acts as an OT prophet, indicting his own people while nonetheless desiring their repentance and salvation. Thus Paul helps Thessalonian Jewish believers in Christ (as well as the Gentile Christians among them) better to understand the opposition they face as they continue to follow the Messiah.

### *Response*

Paul here commends the ready acceptance of the Christian good news as the very word of God. He indirectly encourages churches to imitate one another as each seeks to honor Christ while enduring opposition in this present age. He also locates the sufferings of the church in a broader tableau of all who have followed God in the past. Since our forerunners in the OT and NT faced suffering, and indeed since Christ himself encountered death at the agency of his own people, we should be prepared to persevere in a world that is in opposition to the things of God. The salvation message is worth every bit of energy and commitment from Christ's followers. And our endurance can serve as a model to others who cling to the Word of God in such an age.

### *Section Overview*

Paul and his team continue to speak of their affection for the Thessalonians. Since Paul had been forced to flee Thessalonica, he had longed to return to this fledgling church—out of love for the believers and with a desire to instruct and encourage them further. He had also feared that persecution could weaken the church's resolve. Because Paul was prevented from returning, he had sent Timothy, whose good report back provided much cause for thanksgiving. This affectionate narrative serves to further unite these missionaries with the church and indirectly provides another opportunity for Paul to encourage the church to persevere amid persecution.

### *Section Outline*

III.C. Paul's Longing for News (2:17–3:5)

- 1. Paul's Return to Thessalonica Hindered (2:17–20)
- 2. Timothy Sent to Encourage the Thessalonians (3:1–5)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-282-1"></span><span id="page-282-0"></span>2:17–18 Local opposition in Thessalonica compelled the church to send Paul away from the city much earlier than he had wished (Acts 17:5), so Paul and his colleagues were concerned about how the church was faring amid difficulty. Paul refers to this separation in verse 17 as his having been "torn away," metaphorically employing the Greek word (*aporphanizō*) referring to an orphaned child's being separated from his parents. Paul thus expresses a deep feeling of loss at his departure. Yet he also hastens to assure the church that this separation will be short-lived. He speaks of their distance as being "in person" (the Gk. is literally "in face") and not "in heart" (cf. 1 Cor. 5:3; Col. 2:5).

<span id="page-283-14"></span><span id="page-283-4"></span>Paul and his colleagues were eager to see the Thessalonians again. They are quite emphatic in this regard, and Paul notes that they endeavored "more eagerly" and "with great desire" to see the Thessalonians in person (cf. 1 Thess. 3:10). Note that Paul chooses this moment to switch to the first-person singular ("I" rather than "we"), highlighting his personal efforts "again and again" to return to the church.

<span id="page-283-2"></span><span id="page-283-1"></span><span id="page-283-0"></span>Concerning his failure to return to Thessalonica, Paul attributes this to satanic spiritual opposition. Satan is the Greek transliteration of a Hebrew name (meaning "accuser") that appears in a few key OT episodes in which this sinful angelic being falsely accuses God's people (Job 1:6–2:10; Zech. 3:1–2). The Gospels and Acts mention Satan by name in several places in the roles of tempting Jesus (Matt. 4:1–11), appearing as an enemy in Jesus' teaching (Mark 3:22–30; 4:15; Luke 10:18; 13:16; 22:31), luring Judas into betraying Jesus (Luke 22:3; John 13:2, 27), and tempting Ananias to lie to the church (Acts 5:3). Paul mentions Satan in connection with temptation (1 Cor. 7:5; 1 Tim. 5:15), eschatological opposition to the church (2 Thess. 2:9), and the church's victory over Satan (Rom. 16:20; also Eph. 4:27; 6:11). In 1 Thessalonians, Paul does not specify just how he knows Satan hindered him from traveling to Thessalonica.

<span id="page-283-11"></span><span id="page-283-9"></span><span id="page-283-8"></span><span id="page-283-5"></span><span id="page-283-3"></span>Paul provides multiple reasons for desiring to return to Thessalonica: the believers there are his "glory and joy" (1 Thess. 2:20); he feels longing, compassion, and affection for them (2:17; 3:6); he knows they need to be further established in the faith (3:2, 10); and he is concerned that the persecutions and afflictions they face may have dissuaded them from following Christ (3:3–5).

<span id="page-283-13"></span><span id="page-283-12"></span>Paul wants the church to be assured of his affection. The Thessalonians may well have felt "orphaned," even as Paul felt "torn away" from them. Paul and his team all along had been concerned about these believers' welfare, and they were praying, seeking avenues of return, and longing for news. Even at the time he writes this letter, Paul is continuing to seek opportunities to be personally present again with the church (3:10–11).

<span id="page-283-15"></span><span id="page-283-10"></span>2:19–20 Imagine how happy a child feels when his mom declares that she is "proud of him," or when a father tells his daughter that she is his "joy." We should understand verses 19–20 in similar ways. Paul and his colleagues call the church their "joy," their "crown of boasting," and their "glory." This language conveys both a real eschatological truth for Paul and an encouragement for the church.

<span id="page-283-16"></span><span id="page-283-7"></span><span id="page-283-6"></span>At Christ's appearing (cf. comment on 4:15), Paul believes his legacy before the Lord will especially be the people to whom he has ministered (Phil. 2:16; also 1 Cor. 9:15–18; 2 Cor. 10:13–18). Such "boasting" is a two-way street; thus Paul can say <span id="page-284-9"></span>of the church in Corinth, "On the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you" (2 Cor. 1:14). Paul refers to the church as his "crown" (also Phil. 4:1), much as an athlete in antiquity received a crown for victory (cf. 2 Tim. 2:5; 4:8).

<span id="page-284-12"></span><span id="page-284-6"></span><span id="page-284-4"></span>While "boasting" can often designate sinful pride (e.g., 1 Cor. 1:28–31), Paul affirms an appropriate kind of boasting. The distinction concerns in what one "boasts." For example, Paul forbids anyone to boast in his or her meritorious works, as if such works garnered salvation (e.g., Rom. 2:23; 3:27; 4:2; Eph. 2:9). On the other hand, Paul takes appropriate confidence in the way he behaves among the churches, and boasts of such things (2 Cor. 1:12). He willingly boasts in his weakness, since it leads to Christ's glory shining through his witness (2 Cor. 11:21–12:10; cf. also Rom. 15:17–21). Paul even boasts of particular churches in his communications with other churches (e.g., 2 Cor. 7:14; 8:24; 9:2–3).

<span id="page-284-10"></span><span id="page-284-8"></span><span id="page-284-5"></span>Paul addresses his joy and pride in the Thessalonian church especially as a means of encouraging them. Such expressions should be seen in light of the deep affection he repeatedly expresses throughout the letter. Thus when Paul and his colleagues remind the church of their joy in them, we should expect that the church too would rejoice in the profound news that they have brought joy to their spiritual fathers in the Lord, who had first conveyed the gospel to them and who have expressed such affection for them. When Paul calls them his "crown of boasting," this would indeed be akin to children's witnessing their parents' beaming with pride.

<span id="page-284-17"></span><span id="page-284-16"></span><span id="page-284-15"></span><span id="page-284-14"></span>3:1–3a Though Paul was hindered from traveling to Thessalonica (2:18), Timothy was able to go. Paul wants the church to see Timothy's visit as an affectionate effort to encourage them and to learn of their welfare (3:2). Paul hoped Timothy's work would help prevent the church from being "moved" by their afflictions (3:3a), since Paul was concerned that Satan was utilizing persecution to attack the church's faith (3:5; cf. comment on 2:14).

<span id="page-284-13"></span><span id="page-284-7"></span>Paul refers to Timothy as his "brother" and "God's coworker," and says that the church should therefore receive him as Paul's honored apostolic delegate (cf. 2 Cor. 1:1; Col. 1:1; Philem. 1). Paul had specially invited Timothy to join his mission (Acts 16:3), and Timothy later served as Paul's delegate to other churches, including Philippi (Phil. 2:19–23) and Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:2–3).

<span id="page-284-11"></span><span id="page-284-3"></span><span id="page-284-2"></span><span id="page-284-1"></span><span id="page-284-0"></span>Timothy voyaged to Thessalonica around AD 49–50, while Paul was in Athens (Acts 17:15–34). The full sequence of events is not entirely clear, but the broad outline appears to be this: Paul and Silas were compelled to flee Thessalonica (Acts 17:10), and then later Paul had to escape from Berea to Athens, while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea (Acts 17:14). Paul then requested that Silas and Timothy join him in Athens (Acts 17:15). It is possible that once Timothy arrived in Athens, Paul directed him to travel back to Thessalonica. Others have postulated instead that Paul sent a second directive to Timothy (subsequent to the one mentioned in Acts 17:15) to go to Thessalonica even before Timothy had arrived in Athens.

<span id="page-285-9"></span><span id="page-285-3"></span><span id="page-285-2"></span><span id="page-285-1"></span>3:3b–5 Paul and his colleagues remind the church that affliction and suffering are part of Christian testimony. Jesus himself spoke of how the church would be persecuted (e.g., Matt. 5:10–12; 10:16–23). If Jesus suffered opposition in this world, then his followers should expect much the same (e.g., Matt. 10:24–25; John 15:18–25). Paul, having previously been a persecutor of the church, well understands both sides of this reality. In electing Paul as his chosen instrument, Jesus even declares that Paul will be shown "how much he must suffer for the sake of my name" (Acts 9:15–16). Paul fully expects hostility against the gospel (e.g., Col. 1:24; 2 Thess. 1:4; 2 Tim. 3:12).

<span id="page-285-6"></span><span id="page-285-4"></span>Paul emphatically reminds the church that they had been forewarned that persecution was imminent ("you yourselves know," and "we kept telling you beforehand"), underscoring that such difficult circumstances are in keeping with his theology, witness, and expectations.

<span id="page-285-8"></span><span id="page-285-0"></span>Paul specifically says that he had delegated Timothy to "learn about [their] faith." Timothy approached the Thessalonians to encourage them (1 Thess. 3:2), but he was also to report on their condition. Paul vocalizes his fear: the Tempter may have tempted them away from the faith. The Tempter is Satan (cf. comment on 2:17–18; cf. Matt. 4:3; 1 Cor. 7:5). Paul expresses the fear any missionary may feel who has had to leave the field too quickly: what will happen to the faith of those left behind? Paul is also concerned lest their labor among the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 2:9) show itself ultimately to be without fruit or result (cf. Gal. 4:11; Phil. 2:16).

### <span id="page-285-7"></span><span id="page-285-5"></span>*Response*

As we consider modern responses to these verses, we can envision the perspectives both of ministers and of the church. Since all Christians serve as ministers in our own ways (though only some of us in that formal role), we can all learn from Paul's ministerial practice. He recognizes the spiritual challenges to young believers who have not yet gained proper grounding in the faith. Even when it became impossible to stay in Thessalonica and instruct the church in their new faith, Paul eagerly found ways to remain in contact and to provide encouragement from afar. Such an approach springs from an earnest love and affection for believers. Furthermore, Paul does not hesitate to share his parental pride and joy in these believers. In all this, Paul's ministerial example is worth imitating.

The church is also challenged to remember that every believer may well endure suffering and persecution in this age. Persecution is not to be sought out by any church. However, we should be prepared in our theology and practice to encounter times of suffering as opportunities to follow our crucified Lord and bring glory to him.

### *Section Overview*

Timothy has returned with the good report that the Thessalonians are thriving in their Christian faith and love. Paul expresses the joy, comfort, and thanksgiving that he finds in this news. This permits him another opportunity to affirm and encourage the Thessalonians in their steadfast faith, and he again mentions his desire to see them face-to-face.

### *Section Outline*

III.D. Joy at Timothy's Encouraging Report (3:6–10)

- 1. The Comfort of Timothy's News (3:6–7)
- 2. Contentment That the Church Remains Steadfast (3:8)
- <span id="page-286-0"></span>3. Joyful Thanksgiving and Prayer (3:9–10)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-286-3"></span>3:6–7 The narrative of Paul's longing for the Thessalonians (2:17–3:5) now achieves its climax. Paul has heard news from Timothy, and he rejoices greatly to learn that the Thessalonians are thriving in the Lord. The Greek of 3:6–10 forms one sentence, with verse 7 providing the main verb ("we have been comforted").

<span id="page-286-5"></span><span id="page-286-2"></span><span id="page-286-1"></span>In verse 6 we learn that Timothy has returned from his trip to Thessalonica. The Greek verb translated "brought us . . . good news" (*euangelizō*) is the same word Paul often employs for bringing the gospel to others; it refers to a herald's bringing good tidings. Paul highlights three items from Timothy's report: the Thessalonians' faith, their love, and their fond remembrance of Paul and his team (3:6). From a distance, Paul had been concerned about whether their newfound Christian faith had remained intact (3:5), and now Timothy testifies they are indeed well-founded

<span id="page-287-14"></span><span id="page-287-9"></span><span id="page-287-5"></span>in their faith (v. 8). Paul also rejoices to hear about their love (cf. 1:3; 4:9; 5:8, 13). Paul will soon pray for their love for one another to continue to increase (3:12), indicating that verse 6 also likely focuses on the Thessalonians' love for their Christian brothers and sisters. Finally, just as Paul has repeatedly announced his longing to visit the Thessalonians again in person (2:17–18; 3:5), so the church warmly remembers Paul and his colleagues and desires eagerly to see them again.

<span id="page-287-8"></span>Although Paul continues to find himself amid the distress and affliction of ministry, he has found comfort in such a good report. He gladly shares his joy and thanksgiving, knowing that such expressions will encourage the Thessalonian believers to persevere all the more.

<span id="page-287-12"></span><span id="page-287-2"></span><span id="page-287-1"></span>3:8 Paul employs the metaphor of "life" to express his elation at the news. The continued faith of the Thessalonians brings life to the apostle. Paul notes that they "stand" in the Lord—a common Pauline metaphor (e.g., 1 Cor. 16:13; Gal. 5:1; Phil. 1:27; 4:1; 2 Thess. 2:15) providing a key image of endurance and perseverance. Through the Lord's strength (Rom. 14:4), the church endures.

<span id="page-287-13"></span><span id="page-287-7"></span><span id="page-287-4"></span><span id="page-287-0"></span>3:9–10 Having been comforted by Timothy's report, Paul expresses thanksgiving to God, overflowing with joy that the church stands fast in the Lord (cf. 1:2–10; 2:13–14). Paul articulates his thanksgiving in terms of a rhetorical question. The question hinges on whether one can ever fully "return to" (or "repay," Gk. *antapodidōmi* ) God with thanksgiving. The assumption is that such "repayment" is beyond Paul's ability, and thus his thanksgiving can hardly equal the joy he feels.

<span id="page-287-6"></span><span id="page-287-3"></span>As they rejoice, Paul and his colleagues continue to pray for opportunity to return to Thessalonica (3:10). Their prayer, like their thanksgiving (1:2; 2:13), is a constant refrain in these missionaries' lives ("night and day"; 2:9). Paul and his colleagues desire to be personally present with the Thessalonians (literally "to see your face"; cf. comment on 2:17–18) and to strengthen their faith further. Paul readily acknowledges that, despite the enduring faith of the church (3:6–7), there remains more growth ahead for them. All this continues to remind the Thessalonians of Paul's affection for them.

### *Response*

Paul and his colleagues continue to model a wonderful approach to missions. They rejoice at how God sustains the church in this world. Moreover, they engage in public thanksgiving in order to encourage the church. Even amid the trials of ministry (cf. 3:7), a church is enlivened by how its leaders and servants reflect an attitude of joy and thanksgiving, publicly celebrating all that God is doing.

<span id="page-287-11"></span><span id="page-287-10"></span>Yet there will always be challenges in this world. Thus God's people must remain faithful, loving, and steadfast (qualities all lauded in 3:6–8), and all of us are in continual need of growth, encouragement, and further instruction in following Christ (v. 10).

### <span id="page-288-6"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 3:11–13

**<sup>11</sup>**Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, **<sup>12</sup>** and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, **<sup>13</sup>** so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

### *Section Overview*

Paul prayerfully invokes God's blessing on the Thessalonians. He specifically refers to God the Father and Jesus working together in the Godhead for the benefit of the church. In addition to asking again for God to provide a way for Paul to return to Thessalonica, Paul and his colleagues pray for the church to grow in love, since this will further root them in holiness as they await the return of Jesus.

### *Section Outline*

### III.E. The Pauline Benediction (3:11–13)

- 1. May God Grant Paul Opportunity to Return to Thessalonica (3:11)
- 2. May God Further Increase the Thessalonians' Love (3:12–13)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-288-5"></span><span id="page-288-4"></span>3:11 Having just acknowledged that Paul and his colleagues are still praying to return to Thessalonica (3:10), Paul now delivers a benediction that begins with petition to God.

<span id="page-288-3"></span><span id="page-288-2"></span><span id="page-288-1"></span><span id="page-288-0"></span>Nearly two thousand years later, it seems unexceptional that Paul directed his prayers to both "our God and Father" and "our Lord Jesus" (cf. 1:1; 3:13; also, e.g., Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Thess. 2:16). However, this would have been shocking in Paul's day among Jews and Gentiles outside the church. In fact, there is much theology implicit in Paul's wording. First, he intimately associates Jesus with God the Father, calling Jesus "Lord" (a common OT title for God) and praying to the Lord Jesus alongside God the Father. This implies a very high Christology, affirming Jesus' deity. It also displaces the Roman emperor and all other "lords," whose claims for deity were rejected by Jews and Christians. Second, God is called "our . . . Father," reminding us that through Jesus' atoning work, Christians have been adopted into communion with God (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6–7). Jesus himself taught his followers to call God "Father" (e.g., Matt. 5:16, 45; 6:6, 9; 23:9; Mark 14:36).

This benediction contains two specific petitions, both employing the Greek optative mood in order to convey a prayerful request. In the first petition, Paul asks God the Father and the Lord Jesus to "direct our way to you." Paul's desire to return to the Thessalonians, which has been a theme of many preceding verses (esp. 2:17–18; 3:1–2, 5, 10), culminates with this entreaty.

<span id="page-289-11"></span><span id="page-289-9"></span><span id="page-289-8"></span><span id="page-289-7"></span>3:12 This verse introduces Paul's second petition, namely, that the Thessalonians would grow further in love for others. Paul has already lauded the Thessalonians for their love (3:6). By combining two optative verbs with overlapping meaning ("increase and abound"), Paul stresses the church's need for continued growth in love while acknowledging that such love is already present (cf. comments on 4:9– 12). When Paul mentions "love for one another and for all," he certainly includes loving other churches and likely also invites them to serve as loving witnesses to everyone in their circle of acquaintances (cf. 1 Thess. 5:15; Gal. 6:10). Paul caps this discussion with a reminder that he and his colleagues love the Thessalonians ("as we do for you"), inviting them to love others in the way such love had been modeled to them.

<span id="page-289-12"></span><span id="page-289-5"></span><span id="page-289-2"></span><span id="page-289-1"></span><span id="page-289-0"></span>The reader would rightly associate loving one another with the OT commandment to love our neighbors (Lev. 19:18, 34; Deut. 10:19), with Jesus' strong emphasis on loving others (e.g., Matt. 5:43–48; 22:37–40; Luke 10:25–37; John 13:34–35; 15:12–17), and with broader NT theology (e.g., Heb. 13:1; James 2:8; 1 Pet. 1:22). Paul also emphasizes love for others throughout his epistles (e.g., Rom. 12:9–10; 13:8–10; 1 Cor. 16:14; Gal. 5:14; Eph. 5:2), noting that love is the greatest Christian virtue (1 Cor. 13:1–13).

<span id="page-289-10"></span><span id="page-289-4"></span><span id="page-289-3"></span>3:13 Such love for others has a purposeful intent: Christian holiness. Drawing on OT vocabulary of purity and sanctification, Paul looks for the congregation's hearts to be established as "blameless" and holy. The route toward holy living that Paul emphasizes here is through loving others.

As Paul concludes this brief benedictory prayer, he again mentions (as an *inclusio* with 3:11) God the Father and the Lord Jesus. Paul prays for the sanctification of the Thessalonian believers, rooted in love, to be established so that it will stand firm in the judgment at Christ's return. This reference to the future return of Christ with his saints signals a topic that will soon be addressed (4:13–5:11; cf. also 1:10).

### <span id="page-289-6"></span>*Response*

As before, we can learn both from how Paul conducts ministry and from how he intended the church to respond to his words. Paul models good ministerial practice here in multiple ways. Having just reported to the Thessalonians that he prays for them, he immediately engages in supplication on their behalf. By reminding them repeatedly of the lordship of Christ and the fatherhood of God, he invites them to live with the knowledge that God has adopted them and that Jesus is their Lord. Furthermore, Paul provides us an example of missionary prayer, prompting us to petition God regularly for Christian love to increase within our churches.

Finally, we should observe how Paul's own love serves as an excellent model for the churches; in similar ways, ministers should be known for their love of others.

Indeed, all Christians should ask the Lord to increase our love for everyone in our churches, our neighborhoods, and the world around us. God desires our sanctification in response to his grace, and holiness cannot be found apart from love.

### OVERVIEW OF

### <span id="page-290-2"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 4:1–5:22

Paul and his colleagues have spent over half of the letter giving thanks for the Thessalonians and admiring their steadfast faith and love. They now shift to specific admonitions and instructions that connect to the church's ethical and theological challenges.

<span id="page-290-1"></span>They first address one particular aspect of sanctification: sexual fidelity (1 Thess. 4:1–8). The Roman world was awash with sexual immorality, and Paul seeks to instill a Christian sexual ethic. He then proceeds to exhort them further in love for one another (4:9–10; cf. 3:6, 12) and to encourage a proper public witness through Christian work (4:11–12).

<span id="page-290-4"></span><span id="page-290-3"></span><span id="page-290-0"></span>The central section of Paul's instruction focuses on the return of Christ (4:13– 5:11). Paul addresses two key questions: (1) What will happen to the Christian dead? (2) When will Christ return?

<span id="page-290-5"></span>The final paragraph (5:12–22) brings together a series of Pauline admonitions about proper church conduct.

### *Section Overview*

Paul encourages the Thessalonians to grow in the pattern of holy living that they received from him and his colleagues. He focuses especially on their sexual purity and holiness, given the pervasive impact of sexual immorality in the Roman world.

### *Comment*

4:1 The letter transitions from Paul's joy at the good news of the Thessalonians' steadfast faith and love. Paul now encourages them to continue to grow in their faithful Christian walk.

<span id="page-291-3"></span><span id="page-291-2"></span>Strikingly, Paul employs the word "finally," although two chapters remain in the epistle. Elsewhere Paul uses "finally" to highlight the instruction that follows (2 Cor. 13:11; Eph. 6:10; Phil. 4:8), even when he has substantially more to say (Phil. 3:1; 2 Thess. 3:1). This functions as a transition to the instruction in chapters 4–5. The urgency of what follows is also accentuated by overlapping verbs of communication ("we ask and urge"), words spoken solemnly "in the Lord Jesus."

<span id="page-291-7"></span><span id="page-291-5"></span>Paul and his colleagues remind the Thessalonians that they had "received" similar instruction before. Although they already know how to walk before God, every believer must be reminded continually of proper Christian conduct in order to live out those principles in a world resistant to Christ. As noted earlier (cf. comment on 2:11–12), "walking" is a common Pauline metaphor, emphasizing the ongoing daily endurance required in following Christ. Paul also directs churches regularly to "please" God (e.g., 1 Cor. 7:32; Gal. 1:10; 1 Thess. 2:4; cf. 2 Tim. 2:4). "Pleasing" does not refer to an attempt to win salvation from God by our actions (Rom. 8:8), but it does indicate that, as those saved by grace, our proper response is to live in Spirit-empowered sanctification, which is pleasant (1 Thess. 4:1) to the God who has redeemed us.

<span id="page-291-8"></span><span id="page-291-6"></span><span id="page-291-4"></span><span id="page-291-1"></span><span id="page-291-0"></span>Paul acknowledges yet again (cf. 1:6–10; 2:13–14; 3:6–8) that the Thessalonians are already walking according the Christian pattern they have received, further encouraging them to abound in this holy manner of life (cf. also 3:12–13).

<span id="page-292-14"></span><span id="page-292-13"></span><span id="page-292-12"></span>4:2 Throughout this epistle, Paul often reminds the Thessalonians of what they already "know" from his previous work among them (e.g., 1 Thess. 1:5; 2:1, 2, 5, 11; 3:3–4; 5:2). Often Christian discipleship does not hinge on studying new and deeper truths; it instead entails growth in proper Christian habits in order to live out truths already learned.

<span id="page-292-15"></span><span id="page-292-10"></span><span id="page-292-8"></span>4:3 Paul and his colleagues highlight one particular dimension of Christian sanctification: maintaining sexual purity before the Lord. Sanctification elsewhere in Paul's letters involves many other aspects of holiness as well (e.g., Rom. 6:22; 1 Cor. 1:30; 1 Thess. 5:23), but the Greek here clearly directs the reader to apply sanctification to sexual fidelity (also in 4:4, 7). Significantly, Paul calls this the "will of God" (cf. 1 Pet. 4:1–6; 1 John 2:15–17).

<span id="page-292-19"></span><span id="page-292-16"></span>Roman sexual mores famously endorsed behavior that Paul knew to be sexually immoral. Even though marital fidelity was commonly expected from Roman matrons, their husbands might regularly participate in dinner parties that included slave-consorts. Young men were often encouraged to be sexually active prior to marriage. Ancient Roman literature contains numerous stories of adulterous males, and in some tales even married women would pursue lovers. Homosexuality was widely practiced, especially among the Greeks, including forms of pederasty. Cities were famous for their prostitutes, especially cities on major trade routes (such as Thessalonica). Amid such widespread licentiousness, the church's pagan neighbors likely thought these Christians strange to refuse such behavior. Indeed, some members of the church, having participated in such Roman sensuality prior to coming to Christ, likely still felt the addictive pull of such temptations.

<span id="page-292-5"></span><span id="page-292-4"></span><span id="page-292-3"></span><span id="page-292-2"></span><span id="page-292-1"></span><span id="page-292-0"></span>God's plan for sex, rooted in the creational joys of marriage (e.g., Gen. 1:26–28; 2:24–25), had long been revealed. Paul knew well both the seventh commandment prohibiting adultery (Ex. 20:14; Deut. 5:18; Rom. 13:9) and the various OT laws condemning fornication, adultery, homosexuality, incest, bestiality, and other forms of sexual immorality (e.g., Lev. 18:6–23; 20:10–21; Deut. 22:13–30). Paul would also have studied the OT proverbial and prophetic pronouncements against such sexual sins (e.g., Prov. 2:16–19; 6:32; 7:1–27; Jer. 7:9; 29:23; Hos. 4:2; Mal. 3:5). The early church also knew Jesus' teaching on such matters (e.g., Matt. 5:27–32; 15:19; 19:9, 18). The Jerusalem council, cognizant of the Roman practices surrounding them, directed Gentile believers to abstain from sexual immorality (Acts 15:20, 29; cf. also Heb. 13:4; Rev. 2:14; 22:15). Thus it is not surprising that Paul frequently instructs believers throughout the Roman Empire to practice sex only in the context of marriage (e.g., Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 5:1–13; 6:9–20; Gal. 5:19; Eph. 5:3, 5; Col. 3:5; 1 Tim. 1:10).

<span id="page-292-18"></span><span id="page-292-17"></span><span id="page-292-11"></span><span id="page-292-9"></span><span id="page-292-7"></span><span id="page-292-6"></span>4:4–5 Commentators debate the meaning of the word "body" in verse 4. As the ESV footnote mentions, the Greek speaks literally of "possessing" one's own "vessel" in holiness and honor. Because this is contrasted with the "passion of lust" in 4:5 and falls immediately after the admonition to "abstain from sexual immorality" (v. 3), the context favors an interpretation tied to the sexuality themes in this passage.

In that regard, it is best to understand (as does the ESV) the "possessing of one's own vessel" as referring to controlling one's body by avoiding sexual promiscuity.

<span id="page-293-11"></span><span id="page-293-10"></span><span id="page-293-2"></span>Paul contrasts controlling one's body "in holiness and honor" (4:4) with giving the body over to the "passion of lust" (v. 5). In context, "lust" constitutes a desire for passions that transgress the bounds of righteousness (cf. Rom. 1:26–27). Paul here overtly associates such lustful passions with the Roman milieu of Gentiles "who do not know God." The Thessalonian believers, including those who as Gentiles formerly followed pagan sexual behavior, are to look different from their culture on this matter (Eph. 2:1–3; 4:17; Col. 3:5–9).

<span id="page-293-12"></span><span id="page-293-5"></span>4:6 Paul warns that giving in to lustful passions injures others, and the God of justice will avenge the oppressed. Paul supplies two verbs here to indicate that sexual immorality "transgresses" and "wrongs" another; the first verb refers to crossing boundaries (e.g., LXX Mic. 7:18; Jer. 5:22).

<span id="page-293-9"></span><span id="page-293-4"></span><span id="page-293-0"></span>The particular nature of "wrong[ing] his brother" has overtones in Greek of greed and taking advantage of others (Gk. *pleonektein*; cf. 2 Cor. 2:11; 7:2; 12:17–18). Some interpreters understand such greed as that which defrauds others, perhaps implying that Paul has shifted topics here to business relations. However, the context concerns sexual sin, and verses 3–6 form a single sentence, implying that the subject matter has not changed. The greed of *pleonektein* and its cognate nouns appear elsewhere in contexts of sexual immorality as well (Eph. 4:19; 5:3, 5; also Mark 7:22), and thus this word can refer to the greed of lustful passions.

<span id="page-293-7"></span><span id="page-293-1"></span>In committing sexual sin, those who do so transgress the boundaries of others as their covetousness injures their brother. At a minimum, Paul observes that adultery injures the spouse of the adulterer. Yet we could well extend his thought to observe that many are trespassed against anytime someone pursues their lustful desires—certainly one's spouse and children (whether present or future), but also the other person in the sexual act and all of their own family relations, and even Christians in the community among which they worship.

God, who mandates that we love our brothers and neighbors and not injure them, commanded long ago not to engage in illicit sexual encounters. Every such event creates injury, whether or not the perpetrator is cognizant of this fact. God avenges those who are injured and judges those who transgress his righteous law. Thus Paul warns the Thessalonians of the dire consequences of failing to abide by God's precepts concerning sex. In marriage, sex is a joyful gift. Outside the marriage of husband and wife, sex brings injury to others as well as judgment. Paul closes this verse by yet again emphasizing solemnly that he has already taught the Thessalonians on this matter.

<span id="page-293-13"></span><span id="page-293-8"></span><span id="page-293-6"></span><span id="page-293-3"></span>4:7 God calls the believer both to salvation and to sanctification (e.g., 1 Thess. 2:12; 5:23–24; Eph. 4:1). Drawing on OT imagery, Paul here emphasizes the call unto holiness and sanctification. He contrasts holiness with "impurity" (Gk. *akatharsia*), a metaphorical reference to uncleanness. Although Paul can apply "impurity" to a general propensity to sin (Rom. 6:19; 1 Thess. 2:3), he often associates this term

<span id="page-294-3"></span><span id="page-294-0"></span>with sexual impurity specifically (Rom. 1:24; 2 Cor. 12:21; Gal. 5:19; Eph. 4:19; Col. 3:5). Sexual immorality renders the culprit unclean before God.

4:8 In one last emphatic statement, Paul reminds his readers that the call to sexual purity originates not from mere human teaching (whether from Paul or others) but from the God who created, called, saved, and sanctifies these believers (cf. 2:13).

<span id="page-294-4"></span><span id="page-294-1"></span>God the Father has sent his Holy Spirit to fill and indwell believers (e.g., Rom. 8:9–11; Gal. 5:22–23; 2 Tim. 1:14). Paul does not explain fully here the import of the Father's identity as he "who gives his Holy Spirit to you." Yet in 1 Corinthians, Paul argues that believers must live a holy life and especially avoid sexual immorality, lest they take their bodies, the temple dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, and join them in sinful relationship to another (1 Cor. 6:15–20; also 3:16–17).

<span id="page-294-8"></span><span id="page-294-7"></span><span id="page-294-6"></span><span id="page-294-2"></span>In sum, sexual immorality injures others (1 Thess. 4:6), deserves the Lord's vengeance (v. 6), contravenes the holy calling and instruction of God (vv. 7–8), and associates the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit with impurity and transgression (v. 8).

### *Response*

Christian believers have been granted the great privileges of salvation and ongoing sanctification in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit. Christians seek to live in a way that pleases the God who has already redeemed them, and Christian sanctification especially applies to how we conduct ourselves sexually.

This is as true today as it was two thousand years ago. In both cases, the culture has set itself adrift from God's good plan for sex between husband and wife. In modern culture, sexual relations between consenting adults are assumed to be private matters, consisting of individual moral decisions that have no effect on others. Paul certainly would not agree, since this overlooks the many others who are injured when we misuse sex. Contemporary interest in alternative sexualities, including homosexual and transgender behavior, was widespread in the Roman Empire and was condemned by the apostles. Even the modern prevalence of pornography has analogues in antiquity.

Sadly, many have forgotten that God will certainly judge such activity, especially in the church, since such actions among Christians injure brothers and sisters in the Lord. Licentiousness brings the very dwelling place of the Holy Spirit into sinful disrepute. Paul's word here would be to "control our bodies" (cf. 4:4) and to live as pure and holy in this world.

<span id="page-294-5"></span>Positively, there is much more that can be said about sex. Sex is a wonderful gift from God to humanity to be enjoyed to his glory. It unites husband and wife in lifelong deep and precious ways. To the unmarried, it is of inestimable value to remain chaste unto the Lord's glory. And to the married, marital fidelity expresses a faithfulness in our callings both to our spouses and to God. In a society awash in impure and unholy beliefs about sex, God's people can indeed shine as those who have given over every sphere of their lives in order to walk in a way pleasing to the Lord.

### <span id="page-295-5"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 4:9–12

**<sup>9</sup>**Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another, **<sup>10</sup>** for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more, **<sup>11</sup>** and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, **<sup>12</sup>** so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.

### *Section Overview*

Paul and his colleagues now shift to two new topics: Christian love and diligent work. Paul commends the believers for their love of one another in the Christian community (both in Thessalonica and throughout their region) and encourages them all the more to love their brothers and sisters in the church. He then exhorts the Thessalonians to work diligently in their own vocations without meddling in the affairs of others. Paul desires to increase the church's self-reliance and their witness to the watching world.

IV.B. Concerning Love and Work (4:9–12)

- <span id="page-295-3"></span>2. Urged to Abound in Love and Diligent Work (4:10b–12)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-295-0"></span>4:9 Paul and his colleagues switch topics to brotherly love, signaling this shift in their discourse using the words "now concerning." Paul employs the term for "brotherly love" (Gk. *philadelphia*) also in Romans 12:10. This connects clearly with the OT concept of "love of neighbor" (Lev. 19:18, 34; Deut. 10:19) and with Jesus' many instructions to love others, especially within the Christian community (e.g., John 13:34–35; 15:12–17; cf. also Matt. 19:17–19; 22:37–40). The church already knows the importance of loving one another, since they have been "taught by God"—combining in one Greek word (*theodidaktos*) this notion found elsewhere in Scripture (e.g., Isa. 54:13; John 6:45; 1 Cor. 2:13).

<span id="page-295-4"></span><span id="page-295-2"></span><span id="page-295-1"></span>As observed above, Paul calls all in the Christian faith (men and women alike) "brothers" in order to emphasize the familial relationship that exists in the church (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 1:4). All believers have been adopted by God into this <span id="page-296-0"></span>new family (Rom. 8:14–23; Gal. 4:4–7; Eph. 1:5). As members of the same family, we are to love one another.

<span id="page-296-7"></span><span id="page-296-6"></span>4:10–12 The ESV accurately reflects the structure of the single Greek sentence that encompasses verses 10b–12. Paul "urges" four particular ethical responses from the church (each response appearing as an infinitive). The first response ("to do this more and more") is found in verse 10; the next three appear in verse 11 ("to aspire to live quietly," "to mind your own affairs," and "to work with your hands"). Verse 12 then depicts the consequence of such action.

<span id="page-296-4"></span><span id="page-296-3"></span>In 4:10, Paul affirms again that the Thessalonians already love their fellow Christians (cf. 3:6), and he urges them to abound in such love all the more (as he prayed in 3:12). Paul especially highlights the Thessalonians' renowned love for their brothers and sisters in Macedonia, the Roman province containing Thessalonica (cf. 1:7–8).

<span id="page-296-14"></span><span id="page-296-8"></span><span id="page-296-1"></span>In 4:11, the Thessalonians are to "aspire to live quietly." In a Roman society that prizes honor and glory, the church is to set their ambition instead on a "quiet" life. Paul urges similar goals elsewhere: to "work quietly" (2 Thess. 3:12) and to "lead a peaceful and quiet life" (1 Tim. 2:2). The overall thrust in 1 Thessalonians 4:11 likely involves not disturbing others through meddling in their affairs, laboring earnestly instead. Paul hopes here, as elsewhere, that this will lead to godly dignity (1 Tim. 2:2), provision for the needs of life (2 Thess. 3:12), and godly witness to the watching world (1 Thess. 4:12).

<span id="page-296-13"></span><span id="page-296-9"></span>The Thessalonians are also instructed to "mind your own affairs." The Greek more literally directs the readers to "do your own things": they are to perform the work that is theirs in front of them. This also likely implies not meddling as busybodies in others' work (2 Thess. 3:11; cf. 1 Tim. 5:13; 1 Pet. 4:15). It is possible that Paul is addressing a particular issue in Thessalonica, perhaps among certain busybodies or flatterers seeking patron-client relationships, but Paul does not specify such a problem, so scholars can only conjecture.

<span id="page-296-11"></span><span id="page-296-10"></span><span id="page-296-5"></span>In the fourth and final admonition (connected with "urge," from 1 Thess. 4:10), Paul commands the Thessalonians to "work with your hands." Paul returns briefly to this theme at the end of 1 Thessalonians (5:14), where he directs the church to "admonish the idle." Paul anticipates a problem with laziness, one he addresses more strongly in his second epistle (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 3:6–12). In contrast to any charges of laziness or greed, Paul has already reminded the readers that "we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you" (1 Thess. 2:9). In 2 Thessalonians Paul connects his team's laboring for a living—even while conducting their ministry—to the need for others to work diligently as well (2 Thess. 3:7–8).

<span id="page-296-12"></span><span id="page-296-2"></span>Several commentators have connected the problem of laziness at Thessalonica with their mistaken eschatological views. However, neither epistle to the Thessalonians draws any explicit link between their laziness and their eschatology, and Paul has already taught the Thessalonians in person about working diligently, <span id="page-297-7"></span>even prior to any eschatological error that may have developed after Paul left (note "as we instructed you" in 1 Thess. 4:11; cf. 2 Thess. 3:6–7, 10).

<span id="page-297-5"></span><span id="page-297-4"></span><span id="page-297-2"></span>Paul especially focuses on "work[ing] with your hands" (also 1 Cor. 4:12; Eph. 4:28), implying that the church includes many physical laborers. Paul himself was a tentmaker (Acts 18:3). The Romans tended to demean manual labor, so Paul may be reinstating its importance as a corrective. However, the primary reference to "work[ing] with your hands" simply emphasizes the diligence of the laborer.

We should observe that the three admonitions in 1 Thessalonians 4:11 ("aspire to live quietly," "mind your own affairs," and "work with your hands") all overlap conceptually. They direct the Thessalonians to labor diligently on the tasks at hand without meddling in others' affairs or complaining (cf. 2 Thess. 3:10–12).

<span id="page-297-9"></span><span id="page-297-8"></span><span id="page-297-6"></span>In 1 Thessalonians 4:12 Paul envisions two results flowing from such labor: witness and financial sufficiency. Concerned about the public witness of the church, Paul directs them to "walk properly before outsiders." Nonbelievers will observe the diligent labor and good lives of the Christians and will learn to respect them; hence the believers' proper public conduct serves as a testimony to Christ (cf. Col. 4:5). Some scholars suggest that Paul advocates being "dependent on no one" (1 Thess. 4:12) in order to set the church free from the obligations of patron-client relationships or unwarranted debts to (unbelieving) family members. This is conceivable, but it is certainly the case that, whenever possible, Paul desires believers to seek to "earn their own living" (2 Thess. 3:12). The beneficence of the church should be directed toward those who have no family to care for them and who cannot work due to age, disability, or special circumstances (e.g., 1 Tim. 5:3–16; cf. also, e.g., Rom. 12:13; 2 Cor. 9:1–15; Eph. 4:28; 1 Tim. 6:18–19).

### <span id="page-297-11"></span><span id="page-297-10"></span><span id="page-297-3"></span>*Response*

These verses articulate a vital approach to conducting life in church and society. The call to love one another is fundamental to Christian fellowship. This command remains consistent in both OT and NT instruction. Even among loving churches, we can grow further in our love for one another. Thus, following Paul's example, we ought constantly to remind ourselves of this central tenet of Christian ethics.

Our Christian commitments also determine our approach to work: so far as we are able, we should labor diligently on the work God has placed before us, with a calm and quiet demeanor. Such an approach to our vocations offers a witness to Christ before a watching world and serves as a means through which God provides for our financial need.

<span id="page-297-1"></span><span id="page-297-0"></span>In this modern era, Christians do well to reflect on the theology of work. We can briefly begin such theological reflection with the vital observation that, from the very creation of humanity in the garden (Gen. 1:26–28; 2:5–25; esp. 2:15), we have been given the opportunity to image God in the way we care for his creation through diligent exertion, following the model of God's own work and rest. With the rebellious fall of mankind, our labor became more burdensome (Gen. 3:17–19).

<span id="page-298-0"></span>However, we as Christians are called to reclaim the world of labor for God's glory and our good, treating others with love and serving our employers industriously. Such an appreciation for the God-imaging glory of work informs Paul's awareness of the Christian call to work heartily as unto the Lord.

### <span id="page-298-1"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 4:13–18

**<sup>13</sup>**But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. **<sup>14</sup>**For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. **15**For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord,*<sup>1</sup>* that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. **16**For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. **17**Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. **18**Therefore encourage one another with these words.

1Or *by the word of the Lord*

### *Section Overview*

While many approach this passage desiring to know the exact sequence of Christ's return, such knowledge is not Paul's principal concern. Rather, he encourages the Thessalonians that Christians who have died will be raised when Christ returns. They shall again see their loved ones in Christ on that day. Thus they ought not grieve in the same manner as their pagan neighbors do.

<span id="page-298-2"></span>In the process of assuring the church that the Christian dead will be raised, Paul does provide a brief outline of future events (1 Thess. 4:15–17), following the eschatological teaching of Jesus. When the Lord descends from heaven, everyone will know what is happening, for voices and instruments shall loudly declare his arrival. The Christian dead will be raised first, and the living will join the risen saints in meeting the Lord.

<span id="page-298-3"></span>As one approaches these end-time sections in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, it is helpful to keep at least four observations in mind: (1) Often Paul is answering different questions than modern interpreters ask, and thus we should be aware that, in the providence of God, we may not be able from Paul's words to reach satisfactory answers to all of our modern theological ponderings. (2) Paul has lived previously in Thessalonica, and he has taught the church about eschatology, so in this epistle <span id="page-299-14"></span>he often omits full discussion of concepts the Thessalonians already know; this makes interpretation challenging, requiring humility from modern exegetes (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 2:5–6). (3) Paul repeatedly displays dependence on Jesus' teaching, and this should influence our approach to interpreting his words. (4) Paul is concerned primarily with encouraging the church in his day (rather than with informing their eschatological speculation); in particular, he seeks to reassure Christians in the midst of grief (1 Thess. 4:13–18) and to remind them always to be prepared for Christ's return (1 Thess. 5:1–11).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-299-11"></span><span id="page-299-8"></span><span id="page-299-5"></span>4:13 Paul introduces this new topic by stating, "we do not want you to be uninformed," in order to accentuate the following discussion (cf. 1 Cor. 10:1; also Rom. 1:13; 11:25; 1 Cor. 12:1; 2 Cor. 1:8). Paul desires the Thessalonians to be informed appropriately about "those who are asleep."

<span id="page-299-9"></span><span id="page-299-0"></span>Sleep serves as a common NT metaphor for death (e.g., 1 Cor. 15:6, 18, 20; also Matt. 27:52; Acts 7:60; 13:36). This sleep metaphor often appears in contexts in which the future resurrection of believers is discussed. Sleep is thus a particularly apt symbol. The dead in Christ have merely fallen asleep, awaiting their awakening in the coming resurrection (e.g., John 11:11; Eph. 5:14). This need not imply a lack of conscious awareness in the intermediate state between death and resurrection (e.g., Luke 16:19–31; 23:43; Phil. 1:21–23; Rev. 4:4; 7:1–17).

<span id="page-299-4"></span><span id="page-299-2"></span><span id="page-299-1"></span>Paul discusses this issue in order that "you may not grieve as others do who have no hope." Some assume mistakenly that this verse implies that Christians should never grieve at all. However, even our Lord grieved the death of his friend Lazarus and wept for the pain of separation that Lazarus's death caused his family and friends (John 11:33–36; cf. Acts 9:37–39). Paul elsewhere encourages believers to weep together amid the travails of life (Rom. 12:15; 1 Cor. 12:26). For believers, death does not have the final word, but it does cause a separation between us and those we love, which naturally produces grief.

<span id="page-299-10"></span><span id="page-299-7"></span>Nevertheless, Paul encourages believers to have a different kind of grief from unbelievers—"not . . . as others do who have no hope" (cf. Eph. 2:12). Christians grieve while still living hopeful of the future regathering of believers at the resurrection (John 11:25–26).

<span id="page-299-12"></span><span id="page-299-6"></span><span id="page-299-3"></span>4:14 Paul heralds the basis for Christian hope: Jesus "died and rose again" (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1–11; Rom. 6:1–5; 1 Thess. 5:10). Jesus' resurrection confirms his victory over sin and death and displays the pattern of resurrection life that he will grant his

<span id="page-300-11"></span>followers at his return (cf. 1 Cor. 15:12–58; Phil. 3:20–21). Thus, in Jesus' resurrection the church has confidence that God will raise their dead brothers and sisters in Christ. Indeed, these risen believers will be an integral part of his second coming.

<span id="page-300-10"></span><span id="page-300-3"></span>4:15 Paul repeats a truth that he comprehends "by a word from the Lord." Paul knows Jesus' instructions to his disciples concerning eschatology, though possibly he has also received prophetic revelation from Jesus. Much of what follows clearly parallels Jesus' teaching found in the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24–25; Mark 13; Luke 21; cf. also comment on 1 Thess. 1:8–10). This includes the return of the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 24:30), the trumpet call (Matt. 24:31), the gathering of the elect from the ends of the earth and heaven (Mark 13:27), the inability to know the day of the Lord's return (Matt. 24:42), and Jesus' return being likened to a thief in the night (Matt. 24:43).

<span id="page-300-9"></span><span id="page-300-7"></span><span id="page-300-6"></span><span id="page-300-4"></span>Key to the next few verses is Paul's division between those Christians who die prior to Christ's return ("those who have fallen asleep" or "the dead in Christ") and those who are still living on earth when Jesus appears ("we who are alive" or those "left until the coming of the Lord"). Paul demonstrates that the dead in Christ are indeed raised at the Lord's return, even prior to the still-living believers' welcoming Christ.

<span id="page-300-14"></span><span id="page-300-13"></span>Indeed, the dead in Christ are raised "first" (1 Thess. 4:16). Or, as Paul puts it in verse 15, "We who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep." The "coming [Gk. *parousia*] of the Lord" is a common NT phrase designating Christ's return in order to establish his eternal kingdom and rule (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 2:1).

<span id="page-300-16"></span>4:16 In the next two verses, Paul provides a basic order of events at Jesus' return, emphasizing that the dead in Christ experience resurrection glory. This sequence of events follows the contours of Jesus' own eschatological instruction (esp. Matt. 24:30–31; Mark 13:26–27; Luke 21:27).

<span id="page-300-8"></span><span id="page-300-5"></span><span id="page-300-1"></span>First, the Lord "will descend from heaven." As Jesus mentions (quoting Dan. 7:13), the Son of Man will come "on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matt. 24:30; cf. Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27). Many images in Revelation overlap here, but especially the coming from heaven of Jesus as the rider on the white horse, escorted by angelic armies, while an angel cries out in a loud voice (Rev. 19:11–21).

<span id="page-300-17"></span><span id="page-300-15"></span><span id="page-300-2"></span>This appearance is accompanied by three sounds: "a cry of command," "the voice of the archangel," and "the sound of the trumpet of God." Paul elsewhere describes Jesus' being "revealed from heaven with his mighty angels" (2 Thess. 1:7; for angels, cf. Matt. 13:41, 49; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31). The sounding of a "loud trumpet" is also mentioned explicitly in Matthew 24:31 (cf. 1 Cor. 15:52). The blowing of trumpets during the eschatological return of the people of God is known in the OT (e.g., Isa. 27:13), and trumpets are featured in the book of Revelation as well (esp. chs. 8–11).

<span id="page-300-12"></span><span id="page-300-0"></span>Central to Paul's argument are the words, "the dead in Christ will rise first." Although the resurrection of the believing dead receives frequent mention in <span id="page-301-7"></span>the NT (e.g., 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; also Luke 14:14; Rev. 20:4–5), Jesus' own eschatological teaching in the Gospels does not directly state that the resurrection of the dead occurs "first" (before the living go to meet the Lord). Perhaps Paul was meditating on Jesus' statement that the angels "will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other" (Matt. 24:31; cf. Mark 13:27). Or perhaps Paul knew more from oral apostolic tradition or direct revelation.

<span id="page-301-10"></span><span id="page-301-2"></span>4:17 After the believing dead have been raised, the story shifts to the believers who remain alive at the time of Jesus' return. This verse has been the subject of much controversy, principally about what it means for living believers to be "caught up together with them in the clouds" and to "meet the Lord in the air." Many contend this provides the exegetical basis for the theology of a future "rapture," in which living believers are suddenly taken out of this world and are taken directly to heaven prior to the great tribulation that precedes a millennium believed to be yet in the future.

<span id="page-301-3"></span>Many also suggest an analogy with those "taken" in the time of Noah (cf. Matt. 24:40–41). Yet this analogy is problematic, since those "taken" in the time of Noah were taken by drowning unto death and judgment, while those who were left behind (namely Noah and his family) experienced the salvation of God.

<span id="page-301-9"></span><span id="page-301-8"></span><span id="page-301-5"></span>There are difficulties in 1 Thessalonians for the rapture theory. This interpretation would imply that Jesus' glorious descent is only partial, stopping in the clouds/air briefly in order to meet the raptured Christians before returning to heaven with them. It seems more likely that Paul expects Jesus' descent to continue from the heavens to the earth. Thus many have argued that the verb for "meet" in the phrase "meet the Lord in the air" is key to understanding these anticipated events. This Greek word for "meet" (*apantēsis*) appears in only two other NT texts. In the eschatological parable of Matthew 25:6, the virgins wait for the bridegroom, whom they "meet" and welcome back to the wedding feast. In Acts 28:15, Roman believers travel out to the Forum of Appius in order to welcome Paul and bring him back to Rome with them. In both Matthew 25 and Acts 28, the action of meeting involves going forth to greet an honored person, then promptly returning with the honored guest. Many instances of *apantēsis* in the Septuagint Greek OT follow a comparable pattern (e.g., Judg. 4:18; 11:31, 34; 19:3; 1 Sam. 13:10), and secular Greek writings use the word to speak of civic delegations going out to welcome a dignitary before returning in celebration to the city.

<span id="page-301-6"></span><span id="page-301-4"></span><span id="page-301-1"></span><span id="page-301-0"></span>This would imply that, at Christ's appearance, Paul expects the dead in Christ to be raised, followed by the lifting up of the living believers to welcome Jesus in the air, before Jesus descends to earth with his people in order to judge the world and establish fully his kingdom on earth. For Jesus' arriving "on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory," again see Matthew 24:30 (quoting Dan. 7:13; also Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27). Some have suggested that "in the air" metaphorically implies something like "out in the open," perhaps in the midst of the clouds that have descended all the way to earth with Jesus. However, it is more probable that Paul intends the "air" and "clouds" to be used to designate a physical space between the earth and the heavens.

In addition to emphasizing the resurrection of the dead, it is important to stress Paul's final clause in this verse. There, Paul expresses confidence in the eternal life of believers in the age to come: "and so we will always be with the Lord."

<span id="page-302-0"></span>4:18 Paul concludes this section with an imperative to encourage one another with this teaching. Believers in Thessalonica who were concerned about the fate of their dead brothers and sisters in the Lord should be comforted by Paul's teaching. Jesus himself had revealed that the dead in Christ are to be raised—even raised before the living have the privilege of meeting Christ. Therefore, Christians need not grieve without hope.

### *Response*

Modern Christians often study such passages in order to develop a detailed itinerary of Christ's return. While this paragraph does provide important information, we should first and foremost acknowledge that Paul has a different objective in mind. He primarily desires to comfort Christians in the loss of their loved ones.

The dead in Christ are merely asleep, awaiting the day of their resurrection at Christ's return. This hope is true, since the very essentials of the gospel (Jesus' death and resurrection) provide confidence that God will raise the dead, whom Christ has redeemed. We can grieve with hope!

It is not wrong to wonder about the itinerary of Christ's return. However, we should be cognizant that in these verses Paul presents only a selection of coming eschatological events (e.g., there is no mention of signs portending Jesus' return or of the final judgment). And we should admit that in these few short verses Paul speaks in such cursory fashion (likely assuming prior teaching in person among the Thessalonians) that it is difficult to fill in definitively all of the many other details we may wish to know. Christians should engage in debates about eschatology with great humility.

### <span id="page-302-1"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 5:1–11

### *Section Overview*

Paul reminds the Thessalonians of what they already know: the timing of Jesus' second coming will be a surprise. Jesus himself taught that his appearance could be likened to a thief in the night, coming at a time when people do not expect it. Thus the Christian is called to be prepared at all times. In contrast to those who are in metaphorical darkness and do not follow Jesus, Christians are to be children of the light—walking in faith, love, and hope. The Christian destiny is salvation at Christ's return.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-303-5"></span><span id="page-303-2"></span><span id="page-303-1"></span><span id="page-303-0"></span>5:1 Many wish to know when Jesus will return to establish his kingdom fully. The disciples asked this very question (Matt. 24:3; Mark 13:4; Luke 21:7). In Jesus' reply, known as the Olivet Discourse, he affirms that, though signs will presage his return, the actual timing of his second coming is not for us to know (Matt. 24:36–44; Mark 13:32–37). Instead, believers should wait patiently and always be prepared for his appearance (e.g., Matt. 24:45–25:13; Luke 12:39–46). In 1 Thessalonians 5, Paul also answers questions about the timing of Jesus' return, and he carefully models his response on Jesus' teaching. It may be that a letter had arrived from Thessalonica or that Timothy had brought back news, thus signaling the Thessalonians' desire for more instruction on the timing of Jesus' second coming.

<span id="page-303-4"></span><span id="page-303-3"></span>Concerning "the times and the seasons," a similar expression occurs in Acts 1:7, where Jesus responds to the disciples' question about the timing of the restoration of the kingdom of God: "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father

has fixed by his own authority." Referring again to the church as "brothers," Paul reminds the church concerning instruction they had already received when Paul and his team were with them in Thessalonica. Rhetorically, Paul underscores that they "have no need to have anything written to you."

<span id="page-304-9"></span>5:2 Paul stresses again that they already know the answer to this question, employing the intensified pronoun "you yourselves" and stating that they are already "fully" (Gk. *akribōs*, "accurately") aware of the proper reply.

<span id="page-304-8"></span><span id="page-304-5"></span>Admittedly, this reply is perhaps disappointing to some: the timing of Jesus' return will be a surprise. Jesus compared his return to a "thief," who comes in the night at a time at which no one expects him (Matt. 24:43; Luke 12:39). In this verse, Paul references Jesus' own eschatological teaching, as he did earlier (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:10; 4:15; 4:16; 5:1). Jesus' "thief" aphorism was clearly well known in the apostolic tradition (cf. 2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 3:3; 16:15). Throughout the NT, this thief saying appears in the context of warning and exhortation. The thief causes injury to the household; therefore, those unprepared for the Lord's return will suffer loss and destruction. This provides a helpful transition to the thought of 5:3–8.

<span id="page-304-14"></span><span id="page-304-11"></span><span id="page-304-3"></span><span id="page-304-0"></span>Paul draws on OT vocabulary for the "day of the Lord" (e.g., Isa. 13:6, 9; Jer. 46:10; Ezek. 30:3; Joel 2:31; 3:14; Amos 5:18–20; Zeph. 1:7–18; Mal. 4:5) to depict the day on which the Lord Jesus will appear to bring final judgment on his enemies and vindication for his people (1 Cor. 1:8; 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; 2 Thess. 2:2; also 2 Pet. 3:10).

<span id="page-304-10"></span><span id="page-304-7"></span>5:3 Since Christ's return will come as a surprise, Paul warns that those who are not following Christ are in danger of being caught unaware. People may become so acclimatized to the status quo that they forget that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead (cf. also 2 Pet. 3:4).

<span id="page-304-13"></span><span id="page-304-2"></span><span id="page-304-1"></span>Paul pictures someone who observes, "There is peace and security," and thus assumes the signs for Jesus' return and final judgment are still far off. Such a person fails to be prepared for Christ's appearance. Indeed, it may be at just such a moment that "sudden destruction" brings the final judgment. Following an OT metaphor for destruction (Isa. 26:17; Jer. 4:31; 6:24; Mic. 4:9–10; on the "day of the Lord," see esp. Isa. 13:8), Paul draws analogies to the labor pains of pregnancy, which can be agonizing and sudden. Labor pains also appear in various other eschatological metaphors from Jesus and Paul (Matt. 24:8; Mark 13:8; John 16:21; Rom. 8:22). Here the emphasis, as in the OT, remains merely on the pain itself, without reference to the joy of the birth. No one will be able to flee from the sudden judgment Christ brings (cf. Rom. 2:3).

<span id="page-304-12"></span><span id="page-304-6"></span><span id="page-304-4"></span>5:4–5 In contrast to the people mentioned in 5:3, the Thessalonian believers "are not in darkness" since they are followers of Jesus, seeking to walk according to his teaching. They already know to be prepared for Jesus' return. The contrast with 5:3 makes it likely that Paul was speaking in verse 3 about those who do not know Christ. Both "darkness" and "night" in these verses refer to those who have not yet experienced the illumination of the gospel's shining in their souls. In contrast, the "children of the light/day" are those who now see clearly enough to follow Jesus.

<span id="page-305-10"></span>This darkness/light metaphor provides Paul with multiple applications, especially in combination with Jesus' thief metaphor. Since thieves steal primarily at night (5:2), those who are children of the day/light will not be surprised by the thief. Their lives lived in faith, hope, and love (v. 8) show that they have obtained salvation in Christ (v. 9) as they live out their sanctification by walking in his lightfilled ways. In contrast, those who remain in spiritual darkness will be surprised with sudden destruction at Christ's return (v. 3).

<span id="page-305-15"></span><span id="page-305-13"></span><span id="page-305-11"></span>In verse 5 Paul and his colleagues shift subtly from talking about "you" to speaking about "us." They include themselves alongside the Thessalonian believers as children of light, increasing the sense of fellowship with one another.

<span id="page-305-14"></span>5:6–7 Paul now introduces two additional related metaphors. When he says, "Let us not sleep," he certainly does not mean it literally. Sleep connotes a passive, callous disregard for the need to be prepared. Drunkenness further suggests such irresponsibility. Paul elsewhere commends physical sobriety and avoidance of drunkenness (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:18; 1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7), but here the reference is metaphorical (cf. 1 Cor. 15:34). In context, sleep and drunkenness make one illprepared to encounter the surprise of a "thief" during the night.

<span id="page-305-5"></span><span id="page-305-3"></span><span id="page-305-1"></span>Connecting these metaphors to the preceding discussion (1 Thess. 5:4–5) of darkness and light, Paul observes that those who sleep and those who get drunk both inhabit the space of night and darkness. In contrast, the children of light will be found awake and sober and thus prepared for Christ's return (cf. John 12:35–36; Eph. 5:8–14). Thus the directives to "keep awake" and "be sober" refer to being watchful and ready for Christ's appearing.

<span id="page-305-7"></span>Some have understood the wakefulness of the children of light here to relate to cognition, implying that such "children" have studied the Scriptures and thus know the signs well enough to predict Christ's return. However, these images do not work in that way. The ongoing sobriety and wakefulness of the children of light has to do with how they conduct themselves as those living in the day. And, in 5:8, Paul will indicate specifically what such sobriety involves: faith, love, and hope.

<span id="page-305-12"></span>5:8 This verse further explains what Paul's images in 5:4–8 have been pointing toward. What does it look like to be prepared for Christ's return? Preparedness means to conduct our lives in faith, love, and hope in Christ. Note that Paul had previously mentioned this triad of faith, hope, and love (1:3; cf. 1 Cor. 13:13; Gal. 5:5–6; Col. 1:4–5).

<span id="page-305-9"></span><span id="page-305-8"></span><span id="page-305-6"></span><span id="page-305-4"></span><span id="page-305-2"></span><span id="page-305-0"></span>Paul adopts the image of God's heavenly armor from Isaiah 59:17 (in Isaiah, it is the Lord God who wears such armor). In another well-known passage (Eph. 6:14–17), Paul expands on the "armor of God," applying it there, as here, to the armor that God furnishes to equip his saints. Some interpreters (especially of the Ephesians text) tend to wax eloquent on why each concept (such as faith or hope) is matched with a particular piece of Roman military equipment. However, we should be more constrained in our discussions of this imagery, since Paul varies the labels for each piece of equipment in 1 Thessalonians and Ephesians. Thus the <span id="page-306-11"></span><span id="page-306-0"></span>"breastplate" is "righteousness" in Ephesians 6:14 (following Isa. 59:17), whereas in 1 Thessalonians 5:8 the "breastplate" refers to both "faith and love." The broader imagery is Paul's main point: faith, love, and hope are likened to armor that protects believers and prepares them for spiritual battle.

<span id="page-306-12"></span>5:9–10 Paul mentions the "hope of salvation" in 5:8. Verses 9–10 proceed to discuss how God's gracious salvation and redemption in Christ delivers such hope to believers, assuring us that our destiny will not be God's wrath and eternal destruction but rather eternal salvation. While believers are in some sense "saved" in the present, in this particular context "salvation" is juxtaposed with future wrath and judgment, and thus Paul looks forward here to the final salvation of Christ's people in the resurrection.

<span id="page-306-15"></span><span id="page-306-13"></span>Such salvation is obtained (cf. 2 Thess. 2:14) only through the work of Jesus, who is declared both the eternal "Lord" and "Christ." In a brief summary of the gospel (1 Thess. 5:10), Paul reminds the church that Jesus' death was "for us," signifying that his death made atonement for our sins. Moreover, Jesus' resurrection provides the hope that someday we shall live with him—our resurrection lives having been made possible through our union with the risen Christ (cf., e.g., 1 Cor. 15:20–28).

<span id="page-306-10"></span><span id="page-306-9"></span><span id="page-306-5"></span>Paul's mention of "whether we are awake or asleep" affords at least two possible interpretations. It could draw on the concept of sleep/wakefulness found in the immediate context (1 Thess. 5:6–7), but then verse 10 would be at odds with Paul's caution that those who sleep are in darkness and thus in peril of destruction (vv. 3–7). Rather, "whether we are awake or asleep" likely refers back to Paul's discussion at the beginning of his eschatological teaching (4:13–18), where "asleep" refers to the dead in Christ and thus "awake" would then indicate those believers who are presently alive. Concerning Jesus' followers, both the dead in Christ and the currently living believers await our final resurrection and eternal life with Christ.

<span id="page-306-14"></span><span id="page-306-8"></span><span id="page-306-7"></span><span id="page-306-4"></span><span id="page-306-3"></span>5:11 As at the conclusion of the preceding section (4:18), here Paul again invites the Thessalonians to mutual encouragement based on the gospel truths found in Paul's teaching. Alongside "encourage one another," Paul adds "build one another up," which is a further idiom for encouraging and strengthening others (cf. Acts 20:32; 1 Cor. 14:4). The importance of Christian community is here assumed, for if we (both individually and collectively) are to be built up in Christ, we need one another for mutual encouragement. In this verse and throughout the epistle, Paul affirms that the Thessalonians are already following Christ ("just as you are doing"; cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:6–10; 3:6–7; 4:1); that in itself was one way Paul "encouraged" and "built up" the churches: he commended them for what they were doing well.

### <span id="page-306-6"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-306-2"></span><span id="page-306-1"></span>Many today, as in centuries past, desire to know the precise timing of Jesus' return. Yet in truth, the timing of Christ's appearance will be a surprise (Matt. 24:36–44; Mark 13:32–37; Acts 1:7). Jesus himself teaches this, as does Paul. That is not to say that no signs will precede his return. The difficulty is that many of the signs Jesus <span id="page-307-1"></span><span id="page-307-0"></span>mentions (such as wars, rumors of wars, famines, earthquakes, betrayals, and false prophets; cf. Matt. 24:6–13; Mark 13:7–13) are matters witnessed in every generation, and the moment of final fulfillment of other more definitive signs (such as the gospel's being preached to all nations or the appearing of the abomination of desolation; cf. Matt. 24:14–22) appears difficult to interpret. Discussing such matters can be worthwhile, but everyone should be humble in the conclusions they draw, and no one should seek a day, month, or year for Christ's appearing. Only after Christ has returned will we look back and know clearly the "times and the seasons" (1 Thess. 5:1). Most importantly, Jesus warns that his coming will be like a thief and will take people unaware.

<span id="page-307-3"></span>Jesus and Paul encourage Christians to be simultaneously ever-waiting and ever-ready. We should be prepared for Christ to appear on the clouds of heaven tomorrow, and we should also be willing to wait for his return to be years, decades, or centuries away (cf. Matt. 24:36–25:30).

<span id="page-307-2"></span>What does being prepared for Christ's return look like? Paul's answer is actually rather straightforward: living our lives in faith, hope, and love in Christ. In fact, as we study most of the end-time passages in the NT, we realize a striking continuity in terms of authorial intent. The NT authors encourage Christians to persevere in this world primarily by living out the essential ethics of Christ's kingdom in response to the gracious salvation we hold through Christ's death and resurrection. The timing they leave to God.

Therefore our response to these verses is essentially this: faith, love, and hope. We already know Christ's salvation in the present and have confidence about the future culmination of this salvation at Jesus' return. Believers will indeed be raised to be with our Lord, whose appearance we eagerly await. We do well to encourage and build up one another in these foundational truths.

### <span id="page-307-4"></span>1 THESSALONIANS 5:12–22

**<sup>12</sup>**We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, **<sup>13</sup>** and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-308-7"></span>Having just mentioned the mutual edification of believers (1 Thess. 5:11), Paul now turns to a series of admonitions to the church. These directives are united in how they seek the welfare of the whole church.

Paul begins by asking that church leadership be treated with respect and that peace reign in the church. He moves to address care for troubled members in the congregation, distinguishing between the idlers, the fainthearted, and the weak. Then Paul enjoins continual joy, supplication, and thanksgiving. Finally, he directs the church not to extinguish the work of the Spirit in its midst, applying this especially to how the church receives prophecies and avoids evil.

### *Section Outline*

IV.E. Further Admonitions (5:12–22)

- 1. Esteem Church Leaders (5:12–13)
- 2. Seek to Do Good to All (5:14–15)
- 3. Rejoice and Pray (5:16–18)
- 4. Do Not Quench the Spirit (5:19–22)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-308-8"></span>5:12–13 Paul first directs believers to respect church leadership. From this letter alone, it is difficult to identify what leadership positions (both formal and informal) existed in the Thessalonian church, and we do not know precisely how much time Paul had in Thessalonica to institute a leadership structure. In other communities, Paul regularly established two formal leadership roles—elders/overseers and deacons (e.g., Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1–13; 5:17–20; Titus 1:5–9; also Acts 14:23; 20:17, 28). Yet Paul also informally included other coworkers in Christ among his esteemed fellow workers (e.g., Rom. 16:1–16; Phil. 4:2–3).

<span id="page-308-11"></span><span id="page-308-10"></span><span id="page-308-9"></span><span id="page-308-6"></span><span id="page-308-5"></span><span id="page-308-4"></span><span id="page-308-3"></span><span id="page-308-2"></span><span id="page-308-1"></span><span id="page-308-0"></span>Paul depicts these leaders' roles in terms of three responsibilities (all three are participles in Greek, connected by a single definite article): they "labor," "are over you," and "admonish." Paul himself had labored diligently in his ministry prior to leaving Thessalonica (1 Thess. 2:9; 3:5), and he often referred to the ministerial labor of his fellow workers (Rom. 16:6, 12; 1 Cor. 16:16; Phil. 2:25; 4:3; 1 Tim. 5:17). In the second responsibility ("over you"), Paul employs a term (Gk. *proistēmi* ) that he uses elsewhere for leaders directing the churches (Rom. 12:8; 1 Tim. 5:17). When Paul coaches Timothy concerning the selection of church leaders, he engages this term for how someone "manages" his household, arguing that the managing of the church is analogous to the managing of a Roman household (1 Tim. 3:4–5, 12). This term ( *proistēmi* ) can also have connotations of "help" and "devotion" (Titus 3:8, 14). We may thus infer that these leaders have been called to manage the church with the same care they give to their own families. The third responsibility ("admonish you") refers especially to the leaders' role in providing instruction to the church (1 Thess. 5:14; also Rom. 15:14; 1 Cor. 4:14; Col. 3:16). In sum, these leaders work diligently at managing and instructing the church.

In response to these leaders, Paul instructs the congregation to "respect" and "esteem" them "very highly." Such esteem ought to flow from a love for these leaders and a recognition of the labors they perform (note Paul's exact words: "Esteem them very highly *in love because of their work*"). Paul knows well that churches can fight and divide when people undermine the leadership of others (e.g., 1 Cor. 1:10–13), so in other epistles Paul similarly emphasizes the importance of believers honoring their leaders (e.g., 1 Cor. 16:16, 18; Phil. 2:29–30; 1 Tim. 5:17; cf. Heb. 13:17; 1 Pet. 5:5).

<span id="page-309-16"></span><span id="page-309-9"></span><span id="page-309-8"></span><span id="page-309-4"></span><span id="page-309-2"></span><span id="page-309-1"></span>The final admonition in 5:13 states, "Be at peace among yourselves." Similar words were also spoken by our Lord (Mark 9:50), and Paul will elsewhere emphasize the importance of churches dwelling together peacefully (Rom. 12:18; 14:9; 2 Cor. 13:11). In 1 Thessalonians, this admonition appears to be connected with the preceding discussion of attitudes toward leaders—both thematically and by how the discourse shifts substantially after this admonition (i.e., with "we urge you" in 5:14). As Paul says elsewhere, church harmony results from mutual humility combined with a unified focus on Christ (cf. Phil. 2:1–11; 4:2–3).

<span id="page-309-12"></span>5:14 Paul now shifts to discussing how the church ought to respond to its more troubled members. Paul wisely divides these troubled personalities into three categories.

<span id="page-309-15"></span><span id="page-309-13"></span>Those who are "idle" and refuse to work need to be instructed firmly to labor diligently (1 Thess. 4:11–12). In a subsequent letter, Paul provides more detailed instructions on dealing with those who refuse to work (2 Thess. 3:6–12). For a discussion of the word "idle," see comment on 2 Thessalonians 3:6.

<span id="page-309-14"></span><span id="page-309-0"></span>Those who are "fainthearted" should be "encouraged." The Greek word for "fainthearted" (*oligopsychos*) implies someone of lowly spirit who is discouraged or grieved (cf. LXX Prov. 18:14; Isa. 35:4; 54:6; 57:15). And the term for "encourage" ( *paramytheomai*) bears a stronger correlation to "consolation" than do some of Paul's other words for encouragement. Those who are discouraged should be consoled.

<span id="page-309-6"></span><span id="page-309-5"></span><span id="page-309-3"></span>Those who are "weak" need someone to help them. "Weakness" can appear in various contexts in Paul: concerning those of weak conscience (e.g., Rom. 15:1; 1 Cor. 8:7–13), those who are ill (1 Cor. 11:30), or those who are without honor or are deemed weak in other ways by their culture (1 Cor. 1:26–29; 4:10; 9:22). It is difficult to decide on which of these meanings of "weak" best applies in this verse, but perhaps Paul is thinking of a whole range of ways in which someone can be in need both physically and spiritually.

<span id="page-309-11"></span><span id="page-309-10"></span><span id="page-309-7"></span>In a summative way, Paul exhorts the church to "be patient with them all." This certainly encourages patience with those who are troubled in the congregation (whether lazy, fainthearted, or weak), but it likely also commends patience more broadly with everyone in the church. For Paul, patience is a Christian virtue, associated with love (1 Cor. 13:4; cf. also 2 Cor. 6:6), and is to be practiced regularly among church members (Eph. 4:1–3; Col. 3:12–15). Ultimately, the Spirit produces patience in the life of the believer (Gal. 5:22–23). Patience brings church unity, promotes love for one another, and follows the model of longsuffering that God himself constantly exhibits. Since God has been patient with us, we should be patient with one another.

<span id="page-310-18"></span><span id="page-310-17"></span>5:15 In line with the preceding call to patience (5:14), Paul directs these believers to break the cycle of retribution and revenge so common in society. When they receive harm and "evil" from another, they are not to "repay" the offense. Similar instructions are found elsewhere in Paul (Rom. 12:14, 17; 1 Cor. 4:12) and Peter (1 Pet. 2:23; 3:9).

<span id="page-310-23"></span><span id="page-310-3"></span>In contrast to any actions of retribution, the Christian should always pursue the good of those in the Christian communion and beyond. We should seek their welfare (cf. Gal. 6:10).

<span id="page-310-14"></span><span id="page-310-9"></span><span id="page-310-0"></span>5:16–18 This block of verses supplies directives concerning prayer. Paul himself modeled this kind of prayer to the churches—rejoicing in all circumstances (Phil. 1:4, 18; 2:17), praying without ceasing (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:2–3; 3:9–10; also Rom. 1:9; 2 Thess. 1:11; 2 Tim. 1:3), and giving thanks on every occasion, especially when he prayed for the churches (1 Thess. 1:2; 2:13; also 1 Cor. 1:4; Eph. 1:16; Phil. 1:3; Col. 1:3; 2 Thess. 1:3; 2:13; Philem. 4).

<span id="page-310-15"></span><span id="page-310-10"></span><span id="page-310-8"></span><span id="page-310-5"></span><span id="page-310-2"></span>Elsewhere Paul commends Christians always to rejoice in the Lord (Phil. 4:4; cf. 2 Cor. 13:11; Phil. 3:1) and to "rejoice in hope" (Rom. 12:12). Paul often rejoices even amid suffering, sorrow, and persecution (e.g., 2 Cor. 6:10; 7:4; Col. 1:24). Paul joyfully looks for ways in which God is at work around him, especially in the churches. Moreover, by "rejoicing in the Lord," Paul indicates that the benefits of salvation and relationship to the Lord Jesus always provide him opportunity for joy, even in the most challenging of circumstances. It is God who fills the believer with joy (Rom. 15:13; Gal. 5:22–23).

<span id="page-310-16"></span><span id="page-310-13"></span><span id="page-310-11"></span><span id="page-310-4"></span>Constancy in prayer follows a common Pauline refrain (Rom. 12:12; Eph. 6:18; Col. 4:2). Paul also repeatedly encourages continual thankfulness to God (Eph. 5:20; Col. 1:11–12; 3:17). As noted in the remarks on 1 Thessalonians 1:2–3, this need not imply that every waking moment is spent in prayer and thankfulness; rather, prayer is a reflexive habit that believers engage in regularly throughout the day. Such moments of prayer also call for expressions of thanksgiving to the Lord for his many good gifts and his saving work in our midst. As with Paul's directive to "rejoice always," believers should find ways to be thankful in the circumstances before us, knowing that even suffering is light and momentary (2 Cor. 1:3–7; 4:16–18) and that final deliverance and eternal good await us at the Lord's return.

<span id="page-310-20"></span><span id="page-310-19"></span><span id="page-310-7"></span><span id="page-310-6"></span>Paul assures us that this approach to prayer (1 Thess. 5:16–18) is according to "the will of God in Christ Jesus" (v. 18). Often people seek after knowledge of God's will, and here there is an explicit statement about what the Lord's will entails (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 4:3; cf. Rom. 12:2; Eph. 6:6; Col. 4:12).

<span id="page-310-22"></span><span id="page-310-21"></span><span id="page-310-12"></span><span id="page-310-1"></span>5:19 In verses 19–22, Paul directs believers not to "quench the Spirit." The verb translated "quench" here typically refers to the putting out of a fire (Eph. 6:16). <span id="page-311-4"></span><span id="page-311-2"></span><span id="page-311-1"></span>The metaphor is appropriate, for the Spirit can be compared to a fire (Matt. 3:11; Luke 3:16; esp. at Pentecost, Acts 2:2–4). However, Paul certainly does not imply that the third person of the Trinity can be extinguished. Rather, the point is that the *work* of the Spirit in the life of the believer and in the church may be smothered and quenched. This is similar to "grieving" or "resisting" the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30–32; Acts 7:51; cf. Isa. 63:10; Ps. 78:40). To borrow Paul's language from other epistles, rather than fighting against the Spirit's work, believers and churches ought to "walk by the Spirit" (cf. Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16–18, 25–26) and "be filled with the Spirit" (Eph. 5:18), thus continuously exhibiting the "fruit of the Spirit" (Gal. 5:22–23).

<span id="page-311-23"></span><span id="page-311-20"></span><span id="page-311-17"></span><span id="page-311-16"></span><span id="page-311-15"></span><span id="page-311-9"></span>Given that the next two verses refer to prophecy, in which the Spirit works as an active agent, it seems that in 1 Thessalonians 5:20–21 Paul presents representative ways of quenching the Spirit. This likely continues into verse 22, since embracing evil involves fighting against the Spirit's work (Gal. 5:16–26). Thus 1 Thessalonians 5:20–22 help us understand further what it means to quench the Spirit.

<span id="page-311-24"></span><span id="page-311-21"></span><span id="page-311-13"></span><span id="page-311-12"></span><span id="page-311-11"></span><span id="page-311-6"></span>5:20–21 According to Paul, the primary purpose of prophecy in the church is to encourage believers (esp. 1 Cor. 14:1–5, 22–25, 29–40; also Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 11:4– 5; 12:10, 28–29; 13:2, 8–9; 1 Tim. 1:18; 4:14). Paul lists NT-era prophets alongside the apostles (and others) as foundational to the building up of the early church (Eph. 2:20; 3:5; 4:11; cf. Luke 11:49), although elsewhere he alludes to the primacy of the apostolic teaching over church prophets (1 Cor. 12:28; 14:37–38; 2 Thess. 2:2). Some NT-era prophets and/or prophetic moments are mentioned in the book of Acts (Acts 11:27–30; 15:32; 19:6; 21:9–14). Notably, Paul and Barnabas are named among the "prophets and teachers" at Antioch (Acts 13:1–3). Throughout these instances, it was assumed that the Spirit still employed prophetic words for the edification of the church. Thus Paul instructs these first-century believers, "Do not despise prophecies" (1 Thess. 5:20). Similarly, he encourages the Corinthians to desire earnestly to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:39).

<span id="page-311-25"></span><span id="page-311-22"></span><span id="page-311-19"></span><span id="page-311-18"></span><span id="page-311-14"></span><span id="page-311-10"></span><span id="page-311-8"></span><span id="page-311-7"></span><span id="page-311-5"></span><span id="page-311-3"></span><span id="page-311-0"></span>Paul also affirms, however, that any such prophecy must be tested (1 Thess. 5:21). Elsewhere he advocates testing and discernment (Gk. *dokimazō*) in the Christian life as a means of proving the genuineness of instruction or conduct (e.g., Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor. 11:28; 2 Cor. 8:8, 20; 13:5; Gal. 6:4; Eph. 5:10; Phil. 1:10); indeed, Paul and his message have been tested by God himself (1 Thess. 2:4). Tests for prophets were similarly important in the OT (Deut. 18:20–22). Testing undoubtedly included submitting the prophetic words to the authority of the OT Scriptures and the NT apostolic witness, evaluating prophetic utterances based on known revelation and consistency with the theology and ethics Jesus handed down through the apostles. Only that which was "good" was to be retained earnestly (on "hold fast," see 1 Cor. 11:2; 15:2; cf. Luke 8:15; Heb. 3:6, 14; 10:23). There was always a danger that false prophets would arise (e.g., Matt. 24:24; 1 John 4:1; 2 Pet. 2:1), so such testing was necessary to prevent destructive beliefs <span id="page-312-8"></span><span id="page-312-2"></span><span id="page-312-0"></span>and practices from being introduced (cf. Matt. 7:15–20; 1 Cor. 12:1–3, 10; 1 John 4:1–3; Rev. 2:2). Many commentators would see Paul's words here as focusing primarily on avoiding such false prophets and heretics, yet Paul also appears concerned that *believers* may speak errant words (1 Cor. 14:29) or that the import of their prophetic statements may be misapplied (cf. Acts 21:11–15). Paul believes such prophetic moments are subsidiary to, and must be tested by, the OT prophets and NT apostolic witness.

<span id="page-312-1"></span>Theologians continue to debate the cessationist position, that prophecy ceased after the close of the NT canon. In theological traditions where continuing prophecy is pursued, it must be with the appropriate instruction that such prophecies should be tested, that they should be viewed as limited in scope, and that they should not serve the revelatory and normative function of Scripture. Yet we must also be careful to allow the Spirit's voice to be heard.

<span id="page-312-4"></span>5:22 Paul closes these verses on "quenching the Spirit" with the command, "Abstain from every form of evil." This coheres with Paul's decree in Galatians not to gratify the desires of the flesh, which are at odds with the good fruit the Spirit grants those who walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16–26). The fundamental means of quenching the Spirit is to engage in wicked thoughts, words, and actions. In contrast, the central trait of persons and churches led by the Spirit is that they overflow with the fruit of "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control" (Gal. 5:22–23).

<span id="page-312-7"></span><span id="page-312-6"></span><span id="page-312-5"></span><span id="page-312-3"></span>The general aphorism of 1 Thessalonians 5:22 provides a fitting conclusion to the immediate series of church admonitions (5:12–22) as well as an appropriate end to the broader Pauline instruction of 4:1–5:22. Such abstinence from evil is not truly possible without the Spirit's working in the hearts of believers, who by God's grace have found their salvation and only hope in Jesus Christ.

### *Response*

NT authors consistently endorse the need for church leadership. Such leaders are called to manage and instruct congregations lovingly. All church members should convey respect and esteem for such leaders. At the same time, the leaders are responsible before God to lead the church into faith, hope, and love—modeling such Christian virtues among themselves and before the congregation. Everyone is to seek the peace and welfare of Christ's body. These instructions seem straightforward, but harmonious congregations full of humble and God-honoring leaders (as well as faithful and respectful parishioners) are strikingly rare. It is thus incumbent on us all to examine how we conduct our church lives, repenting and seeking forgiveness when we injure others. Ultimately, we are called to love all in the church, respecting leaders and caring for everyone.

As we care for the most troubled among us, great wisdom is required. Many need physical assistance, while others need encouragement. However, some require rebuke, lest they exploit church resources when they could be working. Anyone who has served in diaconal ministry knows the great challenge of balancing compassion with wisdom. Paul acknowledges that tension as well. The goal is ultimately the good of the Christian brother or sister; sometimes this necessitates reproof, while on other occasions prayer and a helping hand are best.

As we seek the good of others, we must also break the cycle of retaliation so prevalent in our culture. For example, many a church has been divided by two (or more) sides' refusing to forgive the other. Instead, Jesus calls us to love.

Christians regularly struggle with prayer, perhaps in part because we think it should be easy. Yet regular prayer necessitates cultivating a habitual reflex to turn to God in joy, petition, and thanksgiving. Through prayer we also learn better to rejoice in how God works among us, even in difficult times.

<span id="page-313-0"></span>The church is called to walk in step with God's Spirit, constantly open to his work in our midst. His leading, though, may also be confused by the many voices around us; thus we must be studied in Scripture so that we can test everything for consistency with the revealed Word of God. Moreover, we cannot walk by the Spirit and hold on to the fruit of the flesh (Gal. 5:16–26). Such evils are often subtle, captivating us in ways we do not recognize. Thus we should be regularly repentant and constantly intent on living out the Spirit's good fruit, all to Christ's glory.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-313-1"></span>Paul commonly closes his letters by varying the standard epistolary forms of his day in order to communicate important final truths to the church. He often includes a benediction, prayerfully invoking on the church the blessing of God the Father and the Lord Jesus (1 Thess. 5:23–24). In these final verses, Paul directs the church to pray for his ministry, to greet one another with a sign of friendship and brotherhood, and to read his letter aloud to the whole church. As he does in all his epistles, Paul ends with an invocation of God's grace.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-314-11"></span><span id="page-314-10"></span><span id="page-314-8"></span><span id="page-314-4"></span>5:23–24 Paul's concluding benedictions typically ask for blessing on the churches to whom he writes (e.g., Eph. 6:23; 2 Thess. 2:16–17; 3:5, 16–18). Paul had previously closed the long first half of this epistle with a benediction addressing (as here) God the Father and the Lord Jesus (1 Thess. 3:11–13). In both benedictions of this epistle, Paul prays for the believers' sanctification in light of Jesus' second coming, thus resonating with the letter's eschatology (4:13–5:11). Differences between the two benedictions, however, also indicate that each is crafted to fit its immediate context and to convey particular emphases. Thus the benediction in 3:11–13 requests that God both grant Paul opportunity to return to Thessalonica and also enable the congregation to grow in mutual love—themes key to the context of chapters 2–3.

<span id="page-314-12"></span><span id="page-314-9"></span><span id="page-314-7"></span><span id="page-314-6"></span><span id="page-314-1"></span>In these verses, Paul prays that the "God of peace" will sanctify the believers "completely." Paul addresses the "God of peace" frequently (e.g., Rom. 15:33; 16:20; Phil. 4:9), and in a related way he often invokes (especially at the beginning of his letters) grace and peace on his readers "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 1:2). Sanctification is mentioned earlier in the epistle, especially in the context of sexual purity (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 4:3). Most often in Paul, sanctification refers either to how God renders the believer positionally holy through union with Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 1:2; 6:11; Eph. 5:26) or to how God causes the believer to grow in holy conduct in his or her everyday life. In this verse, the focus appears to be on the church's growth in holy conduct, since this makes best sense of the word "completely" and of the subsequent request that the church be "kept blameless."

<span id="page-314-2"></span>Parallel to his request that God "sanctify you completely," Paul asks for these believers to be kept "blameless" in every aspect of life ("spirit, soul, and body"). There is clear overlap between "sanctify" and being "kept blameless," since both refer to the purity and holiness of the believers.

<span id="page-314-13"></span><span id="page-314-5"></span><span id="page-314-3"></span><span id="page-314-0"></span>Some have pressed "spirit and soul and body" to indicate that human beings are tripartite (also referencing Heb. 4:12), with three distinct parts to our person. However, the NT elsewhere speaks of the whole of a person simply as "spirit and body" (cf. 1 Cor. 5:3; 7:34; 2 Cor. 7:1; Col. 2:5; James 2:26) or alternately as "soul and body" (Matt. 10:28). Indeed, Paul can employ the terms "spirit" and "soul" somewhat interchangeably (cf. Phil. 1:27). Moreover, even if in death our souls are for a while separated from our bodies, humans were created from the beginning to be whole beings, and our resurrection hope is that our souls will find an eternal home in glorified bodies. Thus we need to be careful about developing theories about the nature of our humanity based on such brief passages of Scripture. The broader point here is that Paul asks God to make the church and its individual members holy and blameless in every aspect of their being and lives.

<span id="page-315-7"></span><span id="page-315-0"></span>Paul expresses in a wonderful way his confidence that God is at work in the church. God "calls" his people (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 2:11–12; 4:7) and is "faithful" (e.g., Deut. 7:9; Isa. 49:7; 1 Cor. 1:9). Since God is faithful, he will perform in these believers the sanctifying work to which he called them.

<span id="page-315-10"></span><span id="page-315-4"></span>5:25 Cognizant of the many challenges in ministry, and aware of the importance of prayer, Paul invites congregations to pray with him for his team's mission (e.g., 2 Cor. 1:11; Col. 4:3; 2 Thess. 3:1; cf. Phil. 1:19; Philem. 22). This also connects with his earlier broader directive to "pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. 5:17).

<span id="page-315-11"></span><span id="page-315-9"></span><span id="page-315-5"></span><span id="page-315-3"></span><span id="page-315-2"></span>5:26 In keeping with another common Pauline closing exhortation, Paul asks the congregants to greet one another with a "holy kiss" (cf. Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 16:20; 2 Cor. 13:12; cf. 1 Pet. 5:14). Kisses in the first century were performed regularly as greetings between close friends and family (e.g., Luke 7:45; 15:20; Acts 20:37). Similar greetings remain common in Middle Eastern cultures today. When Judas saluted Jesus deceitfully with a kiss, he heinously violated this standard greeting of peace (Mark 14:45).

<span id="page-315-1"></span>Paul commonly calls this greeting a "holy kiss," likely to emphasize its distinctively Christian application among fellow believers, whom Paul often addresses as saints ("holy ones"). A clear desire for unity is conveyed in such greetings between "all the brothers." In ways that connect well with our particular cultures, we should seek to institute forms of greeting and fellowship that promote further unity and lead to the edification of the congregation.

<span id="page-315-12"></span>5:27 Paul desired that all in the church would hear his letter, and thus he delivers this oath. Paul assumes a formal church gathering, likely connected with a worship service. Probably some in the congregation were illiterate. More importantly, books were expensive, and few possessed their own copies of Scripture. Thus the OT was read aloud regularly in church services for the benefit of all. Circulating apostolic letters would receive similar treatment (cf. Col. 4:16; Rev. 1:3).

<span id="page-315-8"></span><span id="page-315-6"></span>Paul shifts suddenly to the first-person singular ("I put you under oath"), perhaps as a way of emphasizing the letter's origins (cf. Introduction: Author). Paul's concern that everyone at Thessalonica should hear the letter may indicate a fear that not all would have the opportunity to do so, and many commentators suggest that Paul was worried about divisions in the community, finding hints of disunity in verses like 1 Thessalonians 4:6; 5:13–15, 20. It is possible that such tensions existed, but Paul does not provide enough direct evidence to know this with certainty.

<span id="page-316-2"></span><span id="page-316-0"></span>5:28 Just as Paul opened his letter by invoking God's grace on the Thessalonians (1:1), so he closes it in a similar way. With varied wording, all of Paul's epistles conclude with an invocation of grace. Although this is Paul's standard way of signing off, it also communicates a true desire for the church to abide in God's grace.

### *Response*

Following Paul's benediction, we do well to pray that God through his Spirit will enable us to walk more in step with his will, in response to his gracious forgiveness and calling in Christ. Ultimately, we know that complete sanctification will be ours only at the coming of Christ, but we should still always seek to walk blamelessly before the Lord, comforted by the forgiveness we have in Christ, even as we stumble every day.

<span id="page-316-1"></span>Finally, Paul again encourages prayer (cf. 5:16–18), with supplication directed especially on behalf of ministry and missions. Following Paul's lead (5:28), another wonderful prayer of the church would be to petition God to grant his grace to all among us. As salvation is by grace through faith in Christ, so also the whole Christian life flows from God's gracious work through his Spirit in our midst.

# 2 THESSALONIANS

*David W. Chapman*

## <span id="page-319-5"></span>INTRODUCTION TO 2 THESSALONIANS

### *Overview*

Paul and his colleagues again write to the fledgling church in Thessalonica, encouraging them to continue persevering amid a society opposed to Christ. They also address particular concerns within this church, notably by opposing any teaching that the Lord's return has already occurred and by admonishing church members to work diligently.

### *Author*

<span id="page-319-2"></span><span id="page-319-1"></span>Like 1 Thessalonians, this epistle lists its authors as Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. The letter typically employs first-person plural references to all three authors. However, as in 1 Thessalonians, Paul is clearly the lead author, since he twice switches to first-person singular ("I" in 2:5; 3:17). Moreover, Paul concludes this letter with his personal word to the congregation, signing the epistle himself. The reasons Paul authors this epistle with his colleagues are similar to those behind 1 Thessalonians. All three missionaries had been present at the founding of the church (Acts 17:1–10), and Timothy had at one point returned to Thessalonica to encourage the believers (1 Thess. 3:1–10).

<span id="page-319-7"></span><span id="page-319-6"></span><span id="page-319-4"></span><span id="page-319-3"></span><span id="page-319-0"></span>The epistle affirms Pauline authorship (2 Thess. 1:1), follows Pauline style, and was universally accepted in the early church as Paul's epistle. However, some modern scholars debate Paul's contribution to the letter. Those objecting to Pauline authorship argue that the theology does not include some standard Pauline themes; that the letter appears to draw extensively on 1 Thessalonians for source material; that the epistle seems less personal than 1 Thessalonians; and that the eschatological material in 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (expecting clear signs to precede Jesus' return) is at odds with 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11 (where Jesus' return comes as a surprise). Responses to these objections include: (1) Since Paul wrote each of his epistles to audiences with different needs, not every letter contains every major Pauline theme. (2) Simultaneously, overlap in content and style between 1 and 2 Thessalonians would be expected from the same author writing to the same audience, yet variations in tone and content also testify to the shifting situation at Thessalonica (cf. Date and Occasion). (3) Most importantly, the eschatological questions at Thessalonica changed between the writing of these two letters,

<span id="page-320-10"></span>requiring Paul to lean into the same material in different ways. (4) Jesus himself taught both that his return would come like a thief and that it would be presaged by signs (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 2:3–4); thus Paul follows Jesus' approach to eschatology in both letters. Thus, none of these objections warrants abandoning the self-testimony of the letter and the early church's strong support for Pauline authorship.

### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-320-0"></span>This epistle was penned after 1 Thessalonians, apparently while Paul was still engaged in his second missionary journey (while Silas and Timothy were still with him), though a date early in the third journey cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, a date in the early to mid-50s AD seems most likely. For Paul's interaction with the Thessalonians prior to this letter, cf. Introduction to 1 Thessalonians: Date and Occasion.

<span id="page-320-11"></span><span id="page-320-6"></span>Three developments in Thessalonica apparently caused sufficient concern to Paul and his colleagues for them to pen this second letter. First, the need for continued endurance amid persecution receives repeated attention (1:4; 2:13–15, 17; 3:3–5, 13). Second, a false belief had arisen claiming that the sequence of events leading to Christ's return had already begun (2:1–12). Third, the problem with idleness in the community, already identified in the previous letter (1 Thess. 4:11–12; 5:14), required a firmer reprimand (2 Thess. 3:6–12).

### <span id="page-320-2"></span><span id="page-320-1"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

Paul adopts many Greco-Roman epistolary conventions, though he modifies them to his missionary purposes. Thus his opening greeting and epistolary closing have been fitted to his Christian theology of grace and peace rooted in the living God and the lordship of Christ.

<span id="page-320-9"></span><span id="page-320-3"></span>The opening thanksgiving and prayer signals topics to which Paul and his colleagues will return (cf. Overview of 2 Thess. 1:1–12). The bulk of the central section addresses whether the day of the Lord has already arrived (2:1–12). The final chapter provides directives for Christian living, especially concerning the problem of idleness in the church (3:6–12). Paul closes with a benediction and an invocation of grace.

### *Theology of 2 Thessalonians*

<span id="page-320-8"></span><span id="page-320-7"></span><span id="page-320-5"></span><span id="page-320-4"></span>Many standard Pauline theological themes appear here in condensed form. He references frequently the grace and glory of God the Father and the Lord Jesus in the lives of the believers (1:2, 9, 12; 2:14, 16; 3:16, 18). God is just and faithful (1:5; 3:3). God has sovereignly chosen the church for salvation by faith through the sanctifying work of the Spirit (2:13). Believers respond to God's grace in faith and love (1:3–4, 10–11; 2:10, 12, 13–14; 3:2, 5). Then, as the church of those sanctified by God's grace, their salvation issues forth into the performance of good works (1:11; 2:17; 3:13–15).

<span id="page-321-6"></span><span id="page-321-5"></span><span id="page-321-4"></span>The church can be confident that their just God will overcome the enemies of Christ's church (1:5–10; 2:8–12). This confidence is rooted in the hope of Jesus' return (1:7–10; 2:1–12), which will be preceded by the rise of the man of lawlessness (2:3–12). In fact, the world already experiences the satanic influence of lawlessness (2:7). Nonetheless, God remains sovereign over the time and manner of divine judgment on those who align with Satan (2:6, 8, 11–12).

<span id="page-321-9"></span><span id="page-321-8"></span><span id="page-321-7"></span><span id="page-321-3"></span><span id="page-321-2"></span>Paul's theology springs forth into ethics, especially encouraging the church to endure present affliction (1:4; 2:13–15, 17; 3:3–5, 13). Paul models thanksgiving and prayer (1:3, 11–12; 2:13, 16–17; 3:16, 18), inviting the church to pray for and with him (3:1–2). He also emphasizes the importance of Christians' earning their own livelihood (3:6–12).

### <span id="page-321-10"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-321-1"></span>This epistle often connects thematically with Paul's other letters, but a particularly close relationship exists with 1 Thessalonians, especially in themes of endurance, diligent work, and eschatology. As in his previous letter, Paul's thought is indebted throughout to the teaching of the OT and of Jesus. This is especially obvious in the eschatological section, where concepts of the "day of the Lord" and the "man of lawlessness" overtly employ OT prophetic concepts and Jesus' eschatological instruction (esp. Matthew 24–25; Mark 13; Luke 21).

### <span id="page-321-0"></span>*Preaching from 2 Thessalonians*

Expository preaching of this letter should enable the modern audience to empathize with its ancient readers, drawing out contemporary analogs to the challenges the Thessalonians faced. The theme of endurance amid opposition should feature strongly in preaching this epistle. Paul's own model of Christian living calls for imitation. Also, we should be humble in our preaching regarding eschatological controversies, since the original readers, who had experienced Paul's eschatological teaching in person, were in a better position than we are to understand what Paul has left unsaid in this letter (cf. comments on 2:1–12). For further ideas, cf. Introduction to 1 Thessalonians: Preaching from 1 Thessalonians.

### *Interpretive Challenges*

As noted already, scholars have debated the issue of Pauline authorship. Discussions about the possible rhetorical structure of the letter have influenced commentaries on both 1 and 2 Thessalonians (cf. Introduction to 1 Thessalonians: Interpretive Challenges for 1 Thessalonians).

However, the bulk of interpretive questions in 2 Thessalonians focus on the central eschatological section (2:1–12). As noted above, some academics have emphasized differences between the eschatological teaching in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, though this supposed tension is best explained by the changing nature of the questions that arose in the Thessalonian church (cf. above <span id="page-322-3"></span><span id="page-322-1"></span><span id="page-322-0"></span>under Author, also Date and Occasion). One prominent commentary recently suggested that 2 Thessalonians was actually written *before* 1 Thessalonians, with the serious eschatological concern of 2:1–12 giving way to lesser issues later in 1 Thessalonians 4:13–5:11.1 Against this, however, 2 Thessalonians implies the existence of a previous letter (2:15), while 1 Thessalonians does not. More importantly, it is quite conceivable that some in this young church became influenced by heightened eschatological expectations between the penning of 1 Thessalonians and the present letter. We need not assume that a great deal of time was required for such eschatological fervor to arise, since false views can develop quickly in the early life of a church (as testified by the many heretical movements Paul confronted in his ministry).

The sequence of end-time events implied by the epistle has been a matter of debate over the centuries. We should recognize that part of this debate springs from how Paul speaks in condensed language to the Thessalonians, since they had previously heard him teach more fully in person on such matters; thus Paul could abbreviate his discussion about such issues as the "man of lawlessness" and the "restrainer," even if we today might wish for more information (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 2:1–12).

### OVERVIEW OF

### 2 THESSALONIANS 1:1–12

In these opening verses, we quickly sense the plight of this church and also discern the consolation that Paul pens in order to help them endure. Paul follows ancient epistolary technique by beginning with a greeting and thanksgiving, followed by a prayer. Amid persecution, Paul encourages the church's perseverance by reminding them of the confidence they have that God will both deliver them in the end and judge their enemies. Paul then prays for the Lord's work to continue and increase in the church.

### <span id="page-324-5"></span>2 THESSALONIANS 1:1–12

1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

**<sup>2</sup>**Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**<sup>3</sup>**We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers,*<sup>1</sup>* as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing. **4**Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring.

**<sup>5</sup>**This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— **<sup>6</sup>** since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, **<sup>7</sup>** and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels **<sup>8</sup>** in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. **9**They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from*<sup>2</sup>* the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, **10**when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed. **11**To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power, **<sup>12</sup>** so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="page-324-2"></span>1Or *brothers and sisters*. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word *adelphoi* (translated "brothers") may refer either to *brothers* or to *brothers and sisters* 2Or *destruction that comes from*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-324-1"></span><span id="page-324-0"></span>The opening greeting (2 Thess. 1:1–2) parallels the opening of 1 Thessalonians. Paul and his colleagues thank God for the church's increasing faith and love while championing the Thessalonians for their endurance amid affliction (vv. 3–4). Their steadfastness evidences God's righteous judgment (v. 5), which will be fully manifest when God vindicates the church and brings affliction on her persecutors.

<span id="page-324-4"></span><span id="page-324-3"></span>In verses 5–10, Paul transitions from thanksgiving (vv. 3–4) to a brief mention of eschatology in anticipation of chapter 2. He assures the church that God's enemies will face destruction when Jesus returns, while the saints will be welcomed into the presence of the glorified Christ. Paul then presents his prayer for the church, asking the Lord to fulfill his good work in them (1:11–12).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-325-11"></span><span id="page-325-7"></span><span id="page-325-2"></span>1:1 This epistle opens with a statement of authorship virtually identical to that of 1 Thessalonians. Paul coauthors with Silvanus and Timothy, but Paul remains the principal author (2:5; 3:17). Cf. the Introduction: Author sections for both 1 and 2 Thessalonians.

<span id="page-325-8"></span><span id="page-325-6"></span><span id="page-325-0"></span>1:2 The greeting continues with an invocation of grace and peace, following Paul's typical opening formula. The invocation concludes with "in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (cf. Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3). In the first two verses, Paul already refers to God as "our Father" twice, as well as to Jesus as both "Lord" and "Christ"—such language has deep theological resonance in early Christian thought and Christology (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 1:1).

<span id="page-325-10"></span><span id="page-325-9"></span><span id="page-325-3"></span>1:3 The entirety of 2 Thessalonians 1:3–12 constitutes a single sentence in Greek, strung together with conjunctions, logical connectives, relative clauses, etc. At the same time, these verses can be subdivided into thematic clumps, making it easier for English speakers to read. Hence translators often break these verses into multiple sentences or paragraphs. Nevertheless, we should recognize Paul's continuity of thought and argumentation.

<span id="page-325-1"></span>Paul commonly follows greetings in his church letters with a thanksgiving or invocation of blessing to God. Frequently Paul states that he gives thanks "always" or "continually" (e.g., 1 Cor. 1:4; Col. 1:3; 1 Thess. 1:2; Philem. 4). Paul also instructs Christian congregations to offer unceasing gratitude to God (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 5:16–18). Here he calls the believers "brothers" (as he does eight more times in the letter), indicating the deep familial connection the Christian community should exhibit (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 1:4).

<span id="page-325-12"></span><span id="page-325-5"></span><span id="page-325-4"></span>The wording of this thanksgiving ("we *ought* always to give thanks") is unusual (though cf. 2 Thess. 2:13). This combination of "we ought" and "as is right" highlights how gratitude to God is Paul's proper response to the Thessalonians' faith and love. Paul recognizes God at work in nurturing and maturing the Thessalonians.

Paul also underscores godly qualities that he desires the church to continue to develop and esteem. Their faith is "growing abundantly." This translates a single emphatic Greek word (*hyperauxanō*), stressing the copious increase of their trust in God. In Paul's previous letter he praised the Thessalonians' growing faith <span id="page-326-8"></span><span id="page-326-2"></span>as well (1 Thess. 1:3, 8; 3:5–10). In this letter, he continues boasting about their steadfast faith, even amid persecution (2 Thess. 1:4). Their love for one another is also "increasing" (Gk. *pleonazō*), as Paul had desired in his earlier letter (1 Thess. 3:12–13; 4:9–10).

<span id="page-326-5"></span>1:4 Many English translations begin a new sentence at this point, although the Greek syntax (with *hōste* plus infinitive) indicates that this verse continues the sentence begun in verse 3. In particular, the Thessalonians' growing faith and love have resulted in Paul's boasting to the other churches about their perseverance amid persecution.

<span id="page-326-4"></span><span id="page-326-1"></span>In Paul's previous letter, he called the Thessalonians his "crown of boasting" (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:19–20). Such boasting can be similar to the pride that parents take in their children's welfare and success. In this positive sense Paul boasts of the churches to one another and before God (e.g., 2 Cor. 1:14; 7:14; 8:24; 9:2–3). He shares what is praiseworthy among the churches, with the goals of generating mutual respect, love, and prayer and of presenting Christians to one another as models of those who imitate Christ (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:6; 1:7; 2:14).

<span id="page-326-3"></span>This verse specifies what Paul boasts about to other churches, namely, the Thessalonians' perseverance and faith. Paul remarks that the context for such endurance encompasses both persecution and affliction, with these terms overlapping substantially in meaning. The term "persecution" (Gk. *diōgmos*) is slightly more specific (e.g., Rom. 8:35; 2 Cor. 12:10; 2 Tim. 3:11), indicating that others have actively pursued the injury of these believers. The word "afflictions" (Gk. *thlipsis*) speaks of various kinds of suffering, including persecution (esp. 2 Thess. 1:6).

<span id="page-326-11"></span><span id="page-326-10"></span><span id="page-326-9"></span><span id="page-326-7"></span><span id="page-326-0"></span>1:5 It is perhaps better not to think of 1:5–12 as a separate paragraph. Although a conceptual shift occurs in this verse, the Greek is clear that this verse continues the sentence and thought of verses 3–4. Without introducing another Greek verb, this verse indicates that the Thessalonians have provided "evidence" of God's righteous judgment by remaining steadfast and faithful amid persecution (v. 4).

<span id="page-326-13"></span><span id="page-326-12"></span><span id="page-326-6"></span>Paul's logic here may require some explanation. How can their endurance of persecution provide evidence of God's judgment? It might seem that the contrary would be true. Since God is just, one might think these believers should be blessed by him and their opponents punished. As we answer this, it is helpful to note a few contextual features. First, Paul focuses here on the final eschatological judgment of God through Christ (1:7–10). Second, God's judgment in the OT and NT always brings both vindication for God's followers and destruction on God's opponents (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 5:2). That dual movement of destruction and vindication is clearly operative in this paragraph (2 Thess. 1:6–10). Third, Paul states explicitly the purpose of the Thessalonians' exemplary role in evidencing God's justice: "that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering" (1:5). Their suffering provides evidence that God is righteous in admitting them into his kingdom, since their willingness to endure persecution is a manifestation of their faith in Christ.

<span id="page-327-7"></span><span id="page-327-5"></span>It is not that the endurance of suffering itself is sufficient to render the Thessalonian believers worthy of entrance into God's kingdom—such would be contrary to Paul's insistence that good works do not earn salvation (e.g., Rom. 3:19–26; Eph. 2:1–10; Titus 3:3–8). Instead, their suffering enables their faith in Christ to shine all the more (cf. 2 Tim. 1:8–12). Salvation comes by grace through faith to believers, who consequently display their faith as they continue to trust in Jesus, heedless of suffering and persecution in this life.

<span id="page-327-15"></span>The concluding clause in verse 5 ("for which you are also suffering") is connected to the afflictions of 1:6–7, indicating that Paul is not addressing every kind of suffering in this life. Rather, he especially discusses those afflictions that come as a result of persecution for Christian faith. Paul had earlier taught the Thessalonians that suffering and persecution were to be expected in this life (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 3:3b–5). Jesus taught the same, reminding his disciples that, since the world had persecuted the Messiah, those who follow him can expect similar treatment (e.g., Matt. 10:24–25; Mark 10:29–30; John 15:18–25); therefore, Christians are called to take up their own crosses and follow Jesus (Matt. 16:24–25).

<span id="page-327-9"></span><span id="page-327-8"></span><span id="page-327-6"></span><span id="page-327-3"></span><span id="page-327-2"></span>Paul speaks here of the "kingdom of God," following the language Jesus commonly employed to discuss God's reign (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:11–12). As is typical of eschatological language in the NT, this "kingdom" is currently present in Christ's reign through his people (e.g., Rom. 14:17; Col. 1:13) but will be consummated fully only at Jesus' return. When Paul refers to the kingdom, he often looks forward to that future consummation of Jesus' rule over all.

<span id="page-327-13"></span><span id="page-327-11"></span>1:6 Verses 6 and 7 explain further how the believers' steadfastness constitutes evidence of God's righteous judgment (v. 5). The word "just" in verse 6 is the same Greek adjective (*dikaios*) translated "righteous" in verse 5. Combined with "since" at the beginning of verse 6, this indicates a strong connection between verse 5 and verses 6–7. God's judgment comes with the dual components of vindication for God's people and the destruction of his opponents.

<span id="page-327-12"></span>Verse 6 focuses on the destruction component of that pairing. Just as the Thessalonian believers will participate in the eternal kingdom, so will their opponents be excluded from that kingdom, to their own destruction. These persecutors of God's people will be repaid in kind in the eternal judgment. God looks justly with wrath on those who have rejected him, despised his law and moral instruction, injured his people, and sought to hinder the progress of the good news of his kingdom. The specific nature of their destruction is developed in greater detail in 1:8–10. This is consistent with OT prophetic expectation (e.g., Isa. 66:15–16; Jer. 25:15–38; Joel 3:1–21); the teaching of Jesus (e.g., Matt. 10:14–15; 11:20–24; 12:38–42; 25:41–46; Mark 9:42–48; John 3:36; 5:25–29); and apostolic witness (e.g., Rom. 2:5–11; Eph. 5:3–6; 1 Thess. 1:10; 2 Pet. 2:1–3; 3:1–13; Rev. 6:10; 20:11–15).

<span id="page-327-16"></span><span id="page-327-14"></span><span id="page-327-10"></span><span id="page-327-4"></span><span id="page-327-1"></span><span id="page-327-0"></span>Combining verses 5–6 of 2 Thessalonians 1, we may observe how the believers' endurance under suffering evidences God's justice both (1) through how these believers will be delivered fully into God's kingdom, and (2) in how their suffering for Christ proves that those who persecute Christ's church properly deserve destruction and exclusion from God's kingdom.

<span id="page-328-12"></span>1:7–8 Verse 7 returns to the deliverance of God's people (cf. v. 5). This verse opens with the word "and" (Gk. *kai* ), indicating that God "considers . . . just" both the contents of verse 6 "and" those of verses 7–8. As God's righteous judgment brings destruction on God's opponents (v. 6), so his decree also grants his people eternal relief from their sufferings.

This too is consistent with OT prophecy, the teaching of Jesus, and apostolic instruction. Thus, if we reexamine the biblical passages cited in the previous verse concerning the retribution God brings upon his opponents, we observe that the contexts of many of those same biblical texts also reflect the vindication of his chosen people, since these two aspects of judgment (destruction on God's enemies and salvation for his people) come in tandem.

<span id="page-328-9"></span>Note how Paul includes himself, along with the Thessalonians, among those who will experience relief from persecution when Jesus comes in judgment. Paul certainly has endured much suffering and hardship (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:2); he too was longing for God's deliverance. But this also serves to remind the Thessalonians of (1) how Paul identifies with them, and (2) how, as they suffer, they are following the pattern of the apostolic witnesses who first announced the gospel to them (1 Thess. 1:6).

<span id="page-328-13"></span><span id="page-328-10"></span><span id="page-328-8"></span><span id="page-328-7"></span>Although God does grant times of relief and blessing to his people in this life, the epoch of "relief" in 2 Thessalonians 1:7–8 is that of future judgment, referring to the age "when the Lord Jesus is revealed." The return of Christ serves as a major theme in both of Paul's letters to the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 1:10; 2:16; 3:13; 4:13–5:11; 5:23–24; 2 Thess. 1:5–2:15). Not surprisingly, key features in the following verses correlate with Paul's teaching in his previous letter to Thessalonica and his other letters. For example, cf. the discussion of the descent of Christ from heaven with angelic accompaniment in the comment on 1 Thessalonians 4:16.

<span id="page-328-11"></span><span id="page-328-3"></span><span id="page-328-1"></span><span id="page-328-0"></span>Verse 8 adds that Jesus will come "in flaming fire." OT prophetic literature often invokes imagery of fire, especially in light of the Assyrian and Babylonian use of fire in siege warfare (e.g., Jer. 21:10; Ezek. 15:1–8; Joel 2:3; Amos 2:1–5). Many OT prophets portray God's arrival in fiery judgment (e.g., Isa. 66:15–16; Nah. 1:5–8; Zeph. 3:8; Mal. 4:1). We should note especially that Daniel's vision of the Son of Man reveals a blazing stream around him as he brings punishing fire (Dan. 7:9–12). Images of fire are also common in NT passages addressing divine judgment (e.g., Matt. 13:40–42; 18:6–9; 25:41; Luke 16:22–28; 2 Pet. 3:7–13; Rev. 20:10–15; 21:8).

<span id="page-328-14"></span><span id="page-328-6"></span><span id="page-328-5"></span><span id="page-328-4"></span><span id="page-328-2"></span>Second Thessalonians 1:8 references divine "vengeance." The Greek word *ekdikēsis* indicates justice or punishment, referring to God's redeeming justice on behalf of his elect (Luke 18:7–8) or to his just punishment on those who oppose him (Luke 21:22; Rom. 12:19). The people who will experience God's punishment in verse 8 are "those who do not know God" and "those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus." It is possible that these constitute two categories of people—some know nothing of God, while others have heard the gospel and refuse to follow Jesus. More likely, however, the two categories are intended to emphasize one another—those who do not assent to the gospel of Jesus also do not know God.

<span id="page-329-9"></span><span id="page-329-0"></span>The knowledge of God is a vast biblical theme, extending throughout the OT (e.g., Ex. 6:7; Deut. 4:35–40; Ps. 46:10; Prov. 2:5) and into the NT (John 17:3; 2 Cor. 2:14; 4:6; Gal. 4:8–9; Eph. 1:16–23). Such knowledge does not comprise mere intellectual understanding but also incorporates a personal engagement in knowing God with all of one's being, in light of God's revelation. Paul elsewhere writes about the lack of knowledge of God (1 Cor. 1:21; Gal. 4:8; 1 Thess. 4:5; Titus 1:16).

<span id="page-329-7"></span><span id="page-329-6"></span><span id="page-329-4"></span>Paul speaks of those who "do not obey the gospel." The gospel is the good news that Paul heralds concerning salvation by faith in the crucified and risen Messiah. Some might be struck by the words "obey the gospel," since we more often talk about *believing in* the gospel. However, Paul elsewhere similarly talks of "obeying" the gospel (Rom. 10:16; cf. 1 Pet. 3:1; 4:17) or of "obeying" God's truth (Rom. 2:8; Gal. 5:7). The good news of Christ requires submission to its message, for submission is the proper response once one believes in the truth of the message (note how Paul connects all of these themes in Rom. 10:16). Eternal punishment awaits those who refuse to follow the good proclamation of the Lord Jesus as Savior and Lord.

<span id="page-329-14"></span><span id="page-329-13"></span><span id="page-329-12"></span><span id="page-329-10"></span><span id="page-329-5"></span>1:9 This verse begins with a relative pronoun in Greek (*hoitines*, "who"). Thus verse 9 connects its subject with the people indicted in verse 8, and verses 9–10 continue the Greek sentence that began in verse 3. These people who do not know God or obey his gospel face eternal "destruction" (Gk. *olethros*; cf. Rom. 9:22; Phil. 1:28; 3:19; 1 Thess. 5:3). Paul here follows Jesus' teaching that, just as Jesus gives eternal life to his believing followers, so will he render eternal judgment of destruction on those who reject him and his gospel (Matt. 18:8–9; 25:41–46; John 5:21–29; Gal. 6:7–8).

<span id="page-329-3"></span><span id="page-329-2"></span><span id="page-329-1"></span>This destruction is "away from the presence of the Lord" (Gk. "away from the Lord's face"). The primary physical metaphor for hell involves suffering and fire (e.g., Matt. 5:22; cf. comment on 2 Thess. 1:7–8), but the essential spiritual reality of hell places the faithless outside of the discernable presence of the Deity. The destruction is further noted as being away from the "glory of his might." The Lord here is Jesus (cf. 1:10), and Paul elsewhere associates glory, authority, and power with him (e.g., 1 Cor. 2:8; 5:4; Eph. 1:17–23; 2 Thess. 1:12; Titus 2:13).

<span id="page-329-15"></span><span id="page-329-11"></span><span id="page-329-8"></span>1:10 Jesus will return on "that day," which draws on OT and NT imagery of the "day of the Lord" (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 5:2; 2 Thess. 2:2). Paul asserts two purposes for Christ's return: "to be glorified in his saints" and "to be marveled at among all who have believed." These believing saints will render glory and admiration unto their Savior and Lord. Paul stresses to the Thessalonians that he considers them to be among these believers ("our testimony to you was believed"), again conveying

<span id="page-330-12"></span>confidence that they will be among the throngs Jesus will deliver into his eternal kingdom (1:5, 7).

<span id="page-330-13"></span><span id="page-330-11"></span><span id="page-330-7"></span>1:11 Paul and his colleagues shift from thanksgiving and eschatological confidence to prayer. In Greek, this prayer begins as a relative clause (ESV "to this end" is more literally "unto which" in the Gk.), continuing the connection with the extended sentence of 1:3–12. Paul affirms that "we always pray for you," later exhorting the Thessalonians to be persistent in prayer as well (3:1; cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:2; 3:9–10; 5:16–18). The content of the prayer is structured around two verbs ("make you worthy," and "may fulfill"), with an intended result ("so that"; 2 Thess. 1:12) being the glorification of Christ and his people through God's grace.

<span id="page-330-14"></span><span id="page-330-9"></span>The prayer to "make you worthy of his calling" reminds the reader of verse 5, where the Thessalonians' endurance of persecution was evidence that they are "worthy of the kingdom of God." Elsewhere Paul encourages Christians to walk in a manner "worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory" (1 Thess. 2:12; cf. Eph. 4:1; Phil. 1:27; Col. 1:10). God's electing call leads these believers into God's kingdom and glory, inviting the Christian to respond by following God's ways.

<span id="page-330-5"></span>Paul further asks God to fulfill in these believers two faithful responses: "every resolve for good" and "every work of faith by his power." Paul petitions God for good works to pour forth from the faith of these Thessalonian believers. Paul elsewhere affirms the importance of good works when they are not performed in an attempt to earn a meritorious right to salvation but rather spring from the salvation God has already given to the faithful (e.g., Eph. 2:8–10; Col. 1:10; 2 Tim. 3:16–17; Titus 2:11–14; 3:4–8; cf. also comment on 1 Thess. 1:3). Paul envisions these good works' flowing from God's power at work in the believer to produce God-honoring lives to his glory (cf. Eph. 3:14–19; Col. 1:9–12).

<span id="page-330-8"></span><span id="page-330-6"></span><span id="page-330-4"></span><span id="page-330-3"></span><span id="page-330-2"></span><span id="page-330-0"></span>1:12 Paul now states the intended result of his prayer in verse 11: glorification of Christ and his people. The "name of our Lord Jesus," much like the "name of God" in the OT and NT (e.g., Ex. 3:15; Ps. 8:1; Matt. 28:19), stands for the entirety of Jesus' person (e.g., Rom. 10:13; 1 Cor. 1:2, 10; Eph. 1:20–21; Phil. 2:9–10; Col. 3:17; 2 Thess. 3:6). When the name is glorified, the person is glorified. In verse 12, the name of the Lord Jesus is glorified "in you"; consequently, Jesus will receive glorious honor from how his followers conduct themselves in his name. Yet the believers also receive glory ("and you in him"). Paul expects the church to appear in glory before Jesus after the final judgment into all eternity (cf. Rom. 8:30).

<span id="page-330-10"></span><span id="page-330-1"></span>This whole prayer appeals to "the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ." The combination of God the Father and Christ Jesus in such formulae has been discussed previously (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 5:28; 2 Thess. 1:2). Here Paul recognizes the magnitude of God's grace. None of us in our own merit deserves God's good pleasure. Salvation, the consequent Christian walk in this world, and the glories to come all flow from God's generous and undeserved gift that operates in the lives of all of his people.

### *Response*

<span id="page-331-0"></span>Paul and his colleagues again model missionary and pastoral concern. Their teamwork resulted in the gospel's coming to Thessalonica, and the whole team contributes to the church's pastoral encouragement—both via the previous epistle and in person (e.g., 1 Thess. 3:1–10). This opening expression of public thanksgiving to God for the believers must have been deeply encouraging to the church. All of us in ministry (whether volunteer or vocational) do well to follow Paul's model of team ministry and public gratitude to God for everyone affected by our ministries.

The Thessalonians' endurance and perseverance also serves as a fine example for us today, as it did in the first century. Those who take a faithful stand, especially amid persecution, provide evidence to the whole world that God is at work in them.

<span id="page-331-2"></span>Paul typically refers to Jesus' second coming for very practical reasons (e.g., 1 Thess. 4:13–18). In the context of 2 Thessalonians, Paul consoles this persecuted church by reminding them that Jesus' appearance will grant them deliverance from suffering, even as Jesus delivers judgment on their persecutors. We must keep in mind Paul's pastoral purpose, lest our eschatological reflections become mere abstractions, and so that our personal responses remain consistent with Paul's intended applications.

The primary personal response to this eschatological teaching, which Paul desires from his readers (then and now), involves believers' persevering through God's grace in their faithful following of Jesus, regardless of any persecution that may come. Such a response calls believers to holy works, performed in faith and through God's strength, all to the glory of the Lord Jesus.

Thematic connection between 2:1–12 and 2:13–17 can be seen in the appeal to not be "shaken" or "alarmed" in 2:2 and in the directive to "stand firm" in 2:15. Ultimately, like much of the epistle, this central section encourages the persecuted church to persevere and stand firm against false teaching.

### *Section Overview*

Some in Thessalonica had apparently become anxious that the day of the Lord was immediately at hand. Paul and his colleagues attempt to calm such worries.

The modern reader is at a disadvantage in interpreting this passage, for Paul assumes that the Thessalonians remember his earlier eschatological teaching from his time with them. This leaves some logical gaps in the text that the Thessalonians could fill in based on prior knowledge. For example, Paul reminds the Thessalonians that he had previously taught them about the "man of lawlessness" and "he who now restrains it," but we do not have access to this previous instruction, which leads to a diversity of modern understandings (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 2:5–6). Thus these verses have received multiple interpretations over the centuries.

<span id="page-332-1"></span>Nonetheless, the broader contours are clear. First, Paul encourages the Thessalonians not to be distressed by whatever has led them to deliberate about the presence of the day of the Lord. Second, he reminds them that certain events must precede the Lord's return, especially a period of rebellion and the rise of a man of lawlessness. Third, Paul reminds the readers that the man of lawlessness has been restrained from appearing until the right moment. When the lawless one arrives, his works will include false wonders and the deception of the lost. The implicit argument is that the day of the Lord has not yet come, since these events have yet to occur.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-333-8"></span><span id="page-333-7"></span>2:1 Paul and his colleagues begin their appeal by asking the "brothers" in Thessalonica not to be shaken or alarmed by a concern that the day of the Lord had already appeared (2:1–2). The mention of "brothers" here is Paul's customary way of referring to all in the church (male and female alike) as members of the same family in Christ (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 1:3; 1 Thess. 4:9–10).

<span id="page-333-4"></span><span id="page-333-3"></span>The topic at hand focuses on two closely connected events in verse 1: "the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" and "our being gathered together to him." Both events are united by a single definite article ("the") in the Greek text. The second coming of Christ continues to serve as a repeated theme in Paul's communications with this church (1 Thess. 1:10; 2:16; 3:13; 4:13–5:11; 5:23–24; 2 Thess. 1:5–2:15). The word employed here for Jesus' "coming" (Gk. *parousia*) appears at several similar junctures in Paul's corpus (1 Thess. 2:19; 3:13; 5:23; 2 Thess. 2:8–9; 1 Cor. 15:23; cf. comment on 1 Thess. 4:15). Elsewhere in the NT, *parousia* likewise repeatedly designates Jesus' second coming (cf. also Matt. 24:3, 27, 37, 39; James 5:7–8; 2 Pet. 1:16; 3:4, 12; 1 John 2:28).

<span id="page-333-9"></span><span id="page-333-6"></span><span id="page-333-5"></span><span id="page-333-2"></span><span id="page-333-1"></span><span id="page-333-0"></span>The "gathering together" of believers to the Lord was discussed earlier, in 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 (cf. also Matt. 24:31). Paul provides more detail there about the sequence of how the dead in Christ are raised first before those believers still living join the risen dead in the air to greet the Lord. Here Paul refers only in passing to these events, since he is concentrating on other matters. This reminds us that in neither 1 Thessalonians nor 2 Thessalonians do we receive a complete timetable of Jesus' second coming. Rather, Paul focuses on encouraging the church in their present struggles in light of the eschatological teachings they have already

<span id="page-334-4"></span>received. In verse 1, Paul twice includes the readers in his use of "our," assuring them of their participation in these coming events.

<span id="page-334-5"></span>2:2 Paul and his colleagues do not want the Thessalonian believers to be "shaken in mind" or "alarmed." The verb for "alarmed" (Gk. *throeō*) appears two other times in the NT, and both instances are in the context of Jesus' warning his followers not to be alarmed by the false messiahs, wars, and rumors of wars preceding his second coming (Matt. 24:6; Mark 13:7).

<span id="page-334-0"></span>Paul was concerned that the Thessalonians might become anxious over rumors about the day of the Lord. The "day of the Lord" refers in the OT to the appearance of God in judgment, and in the NT this phrase is applied specifically to the glorious return of Christ to carry out messianic judgment on behalf of God the Father (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 5:2; 2 Thess. 1:10).

<span id="page-334-3"></span>This leads to the first of several key interpretive debates. In what sense did some Thessalonians believe the day of the Lord had "come"? Paul's words were likely clear to the original readers, who knew firsthand the controversy Paul was addressing. However, as we are absent from that historical context, we are left inferring much from few words, and so there are many present-day suggestions on this theme.

The grammatical question concerns the time implied by the perfect verb "has come" (Gk. *enistēmi* ). Assuming no one in Paul's day likely held that Jesus was already physically present and ruling on earth, many commentators have suggested that "has come" must be a future-referring perfect tense, implying that Jesus' second coming was very soon ("near at hand"). This is possible, but *enistēmi* in the perfect tense usually bears present meaning, and this is especially the case for all other perfect-tense instances of this verb in Paul (Rom. 8:38; 1 Cor. 3:22; 7:26; Gal. 1:4; cf. Heb. 9:9). In these other instances, modern translators often render the verb *enistēmi* as "is present" (rather than "has come").

<span id="page-334-2"></span><span id="page-334-1"></span>Thus it seems that some Thessalonians were concerned that the day of the Lord was already, in some sense, present. But in what way? The answer must take into account how Paul words his response. For example, Paul does not counter by arguing, "The Lord is not yet on his earthly throne," or, "The judgment has not yet happened," so it is unlikely that the Thessalonians believed Jesus had physically returned and had already performed the final judgment. Some have suggested that, impressed with the Spirit's work in their midst, the Thessalonians engaged in enthusiastic beliefs and rituals, acting like the day of the Lord was fully present in their church as an internal spiritual reality. However, Paul does not respond in such a way as to redress that hypothetical situation. Similarly, some scholars contend that an incipient gnosticism lies behind the text—with church members convinced that they have already been raised in spiritual perfection in this world. Yet this also appears inconsistent with Paul's argumentation in the following verses. Paul could simply have said, "You have not yet experienced spiritual perfection."

The church probably believed that the sequence of events leading to the imminent culmination of the day of the Lord had begun, but that some key events (particularly the physical return of Christ) were yet to occur. Therefore, two main suggestions for "has come" (*enistēmi* ) seem most sensible: (1) the Thessalonians, having heard from some source that the day of the Lord had already partially arrived, were concerned that their hope was in vain since they had experienced no noticeable change in their circumstances; or (2) they were worried that, since the sequence of events preceding the day of the Lord had begun, greater tribulation was soon to arrive, followed by God's impending wrath. Consequently, they either feared greater persecution in the tribulation or were anxious about how God's wrath would impact them. What we can say for certain is that Paul seeks to remedy their mistaken belief in the verses that follow.

<span id="page-335-6"></span>Paul hypothesizes that this false belief may have come "either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us." Given the threefold repetition of the Greek word *mēde*/*mēte* (meaning "neither/nor"), it is clear in the Greek that three distinct items are mentioned here: a "spirit" (likely referring to a prophecy; cf. 1 John 4:1); a "spoken word" (i.e., a teaching); and a "letter seeming to be from us." In his previous letter, Paul has instructed the Thessalonians to "test" prophecies (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 5:20–21), implying that some prophetic words circulating in Thessalonica may be false. Throughout the course of his ministry, Paul has also known false teachers to arise in other congregations (e.g., 2 Cor. 11:1–15; Phil. 3:2; Col. 2:16–23; 1 Tim. 1:3–7; 4:1–5). Finally, it seems that Paul has some real concern that false letters may be circulating in his name (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 3:17).

<span id="page-335-5"></span><span id="page-335-4"></span><span id="page-335-3"></span><span id="page-335-2"></span><span id="page-335-1"></span><span id="page-335-0"></span>The scholarly debate involves whether or not the Thessalonians actually received one (or more) such prophecy, teaching, or epistle. Some contend that an epistle falsely attributed to Paul had arrived, which is why Paul pens his authenticating mark at this letter's conclusion (2 Thess. 3:17). Others suggest that the Thessalonians had misread Paul's previous letter (esp. 1 Thess. 5:1–3), believing it to indicate that Jesus' return was so imminent as to be essentially here. However, the actual evidence for such assertions in 2 Thessalonians is thin. Furthermore, since Paul states a range of three possible means by which the Thessalonians might have come to a wrong belief about the immediate presence of the day of the Lord, it seems that Paul did not actually know what specifically had caused this false belief to arise. Paul may simply be highlighting that no new eschatological doctrine should contradict his previous instruction to the Thessalonians, even if that innovation should originate from a prophetic experience, a skilled rhetorician, or a letter falsely claiming Paul's own authority.

It is worth taking stock of what we know with confidence and what we can merely postulate. We know there was a problem in Thessalonica with a mistaken view about the timing of the day of the Lord, and we know that, however such a view developed, Paul insists that it was false. Scholars debate the precise nature of that incorrect teaching, and while these scholarly options are certainly worth investigating, some views appear more plausible than others. Yet it would be unwise to rely too much on such nuanced conclusions. Rather, the broader contours of the problem seem sufficiently clear for us to proceed.

<span id="page-336-16"></span><span id="page-336-13"></span>2:3–4 Paul does not appear to know the precise circumstances that have brought about the Thessalonians' erroneous beliefs about the day of the Lord, but in verse 3 he does suspect nefarious activity. Paul labels any teaching opposed to the eschatological message of his gospel as an effort at deception (cf. 2:10; Eph. 5:6; Col. 2:8). He then reasons that the day of the Lord has not yet begun, since the world has not yet experienced the "rebellion" and the "man of lawlessness," both of which must precede the day of the Lord.

<span id="page-336-7"></span><span id="page-336-5"></span><span id="page-336-1"></span><span id="page-336-0"></span>The Greek word for "rebellion" (*apostasia*) occurs in the Septuagint OT and in the NT to speak of rebellion against God and his law (Josh. 22:22; 2 Chron. 29:19; Jer. 2:19; Acts 21:21). When the disciples asked Jesus about the signs and timing of his second coming, Jesus responded that false messiahs and prophets would precede his return, as would tribulation against the church (Matt. 24:4–13, 23–28; Mark 13:5–13, 21–23; Luke 21:8–19). Paul teaches elsewhere that the rise of "deceitful spirits and teachings of demons" and also "times of difficulty" will be indicative of the last days (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1; cf. 2 Pet. 3:3–7; Jude 17–19). As in 1 Thessalonians, Paul's instruction on such matters is likely informed by Jesus' own eschatological teaching (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 4:15–16; 5:1).

<span id="page-336-19"></span><span id="page-336-15"></span><span id="page-336-14"></span><span id="page-336-6"></span><span id="page-336-4"></span>In a similar way, Jesus taught that one of the signs prior to his return would be the advent of the "abomination of desolation" in the "holy place" of the temple (Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14). Jesus cites the teaching of Daniel, who prophesied that this abomination would profane the Jerusalem temple (Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). Paul draws on this tradition as he discusses the "man of lawlessness," who is the "son of destruction" in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and the "lawless one" in 2:8–9. The Septuagint Greek translation of Isaiah 57:3–4 similarly speaks of the "sons of lawlessness" who are "children of destruction" (cf. John 17:12) and the "seed of lawlessness" (cf. also Ps. 88:23 LXX [English 89:22]). Following a common Semitic idiom, a "man of lawlessness" would refer to a person whose life is characterized by his opposition to God's rule and reign.

<span id="page-336-17"></span><span id="page-336-11"></span><span id="page-336-10"></span><span id="page-336-8"></span><span id="page-336-3"></span><span id="page-336-2"></span>Further descriptors are applied to this lawless one. He will be "revealed" (Gk. *apokalyptō*; also 2 Thess. 2:6, 8), employing terminology Paul reserves most often for the activity of God in making known something hidden (e.g., Rom. 1:17–18; 8:18; Eph. 3:5). The passive voice in verse 3 of "is revealed" makes it difficult to discern whether God is the one doing the revealing or if this is the work of an evil agent (such as Satan; cf. comment on 2 Thess. 2:9–10).

<span id="page-336-20"></span><span id="page-336-18"></span><span id="page-336-12"></span><span id="page-336-9"></span>The man of lawlessness both opposes and exalts himself over every "so-called god or object of worship." Paul elsewhere employs the Greek word for "opposes" as a title for Satan, the "adversary" (1 Tim. 5:14). The only other use of the Greek word for "exalts himself" (*hyperairō*) in Paul bears connotations of conceit (2 Cor. 12:7), as it likely does here. Paul is careful to say "every *so-called* god," indicating the false deities of pagan worship. The term for "object of worship" (Gk. *sebasma*) refers to pagan idols (cf. Acts 17:23). This man of lawlessness seeks to make himself the central person of worship, beyond any other religious objects or personages in his day.

<span id="page-337-5"></span>Beyond that, the man of lawlessness exalts himself over the very worship of God Almighty. The lawless one's efforts to receive worship result in his taking "his seat in the temple of God." Commentators debate which temple is envisioned here, with most opting for the Jerusalem temple, though others suggest the Thessalonians would imagine an important temple in their city, and still others argue the temple is a reference to the church as the "temple of God" (e.g., 1 Cor. 3:16–17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:21). However, Paul's reliance in this context on OT imagery and Jesus' eschatological instruction implies that "temple of God" refers to the Jerusalem temple. This connects well with the lawless one's action in the temple—"proclaiming himself to be God." The man of lawlessness promotes himself in place of God Almighty as the central deity to be worshiped. That still leaves open the question of whether a future physical temple will be in play or if this is prophetically symbolic of some other coming reality (cf. more below).

<span id="page-337-1"></span>Paul here draws on OT Danielic imagery concerning a ruler opposed to God and his people (cf. Dan. 7:24–27; 8:23–26; 11:20–45; esp. 11:28–39). The Danielic background is particularly striking in comparison to the man of lawlessness in verse 4. We read in Daniel of a king who "shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods," and "shall not pay attention to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all" (Dan. 11:36–37). In Daniel it is this king who sets up the "abomination that makes desolate" in Jerusalem (Dan. 11:31). Other prophets also speak of rulers calling themselves god (e.g., Isa. 14:12–15; Ezek. 28:1–10).

<span id="page-337-3"></span><span id="page-337-2"></span><span id="page-337-0"></span>The central interpretive debate in these two verses concerns the identity of this man of lawlessness. In response to this complex question, we should distinguish between what we can know with some certainty and what we can only suspect.

Two key historical events are known. First, Daniel's prophetic imagery points to Antiochus IV of Seleucia, who styled himself Epiphanes ("god manifest"), invaded Jerusalem, despoiled the temple, commanded the burning of the Scriptures, forbade the covenant rite of circumcision, put to death many faithful Jews, and ultimately instituted pagan sacrifices in the Jerusalem temple (167 BC). Remarkably, a major Jewish literary source from the period appeals to Danielic language by labeling the pagan altar Antiochus set up in the temple as the abomination of desolation (*1 Macc.* 1:54; 6:7). The resulting Maccabean revolt eventually led to Jewish priests and kings again being in control in Jerusalem. Yet, nearly two hundred years later, Jesus applies the "abomination of desolation" language to the future (Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14), revealing that the Danielic imagery establishes a pattern of opposition to God's rule preceding the eschatological judgment of God. Paul draws on Jesus' eschatological instruction by similarly applying this Danielic imagery to events yet to occur.

<span id="page-337-6"></span><span id="page-337-4"></span>Second, before Paul writes 2 Thessalonians, events have already presaged Roman imperial opposition to Jewish worship of God. In particular, the emperor Gaius Caligula ordered soldiers to erect a cult image of himself in the Jerusalem temple, despite widespread Jewish opposition (AD 40–41; Josephus, *Antiquities* 18.261–309). In God's providence, however, Gaius died while the image was still en route, so it was never installed. Paul almost certainly knows this history, and it may well be in his mind as he writes. Still, Paul's argument works only if the man of lawlessness has not yet appeared, since the absence of the lawless one's arrival proves that the day of the Lord is yet to come.

<span id="page-338-1"></span><span id="page-338-0"></span>With that background, we can briefly list various specific interpretations that have been suggested over the years concerning this man of lawlessness. Many have looked to a future, yet unknown, person who will seek to exalt himself in this way. Some have suggested that this lawless one must refer to Satan himself or to one of his demons, but Satan is mentioned later as a separate figure (2 Thess. 2:9). The most natural inference from this text and its Danielic imagery is that a human ruler is intended. Some have suggested that this refers to a nation-state (rather than to a particular individual), with the Roman Empire being the most likely candidate; however, the imagery itself repeatedly points to an individual rather than an entire state. Others have specifically considered his sitting in the temple (2:4) to refer to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple at the hand of Titus (AD 70), but the specifics of that event do not align with an individual's calling himself God while seated in the temple precincts. Similar objections could be made against any of the subsequent religious shrines built atop the Jerusalem Temple Mount, whether the Hadrianic Temple of Jupiter (built around AD 135) or the current Dome of the Rock (built around 691). This reminds us of another related debate, namely, is a specific physical temple required in order for the prophetic expectation to be satisfied? If so, then many contend this would require a future rebuilding of the Jerusalem temple prior to the advent of the lawless one. Yet others would suggest a more metaphorical understanding of the lawless one's session in the temple.

This commentator anticipates a yet-future appearing of a human lawless one, whose manifestation amid false signs and prophecies will precede Jesus' return and final judgment. Whether or not there will be a physical temple in Jerusalem is not yet foreseeable. The more fundamental goal of this commentary on such matters, however, is to encourage humility with regard to all such speculation. God is faithful to his prophetic promises, yet the actual fulfillment of these promises often surprises. In the first advent of our Lord, Jesus' fulfillment of OT prophecy, while comprehensible and wonderful in hindsight, was not anticipated properly by even the most faithful Jewish students of Scripture. Who in the Judaism of Jesus' day, having studied OT prophecy thoroughly, would have predicted that the Messiah would be God incarnate? Or that he would come, be crucified, be raised, ascend, and then delay his return to establish his kingdom fully by at least two millennia? Thus, though it seems best to assume that the man of lawlessness is still to be revealed, the specifics of how that might look (including what is meant by his session in the temple) will likely surprise the best of interpreters. Only in hindsight will we understand the full intent of the prophetic word.

<span id="page-339-3"></span><span id="page-339-2"></span>2:5 This verse provides further reason to recommend humility to all modern interpreters. Paul remarks, "Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?" Clearly, the original audience already knew more Pauline eschatological teaching than we presently have. Although Paul and his colleagues were compelled to leave Thessalonica sooner than they wished (Acts 17:10), they were able to begin instructing the Thessalonians concerning the events of Jesus' return. Paul assumes the Thessalonians recall that instruction. Therefore, Paul often speaks in abbreviated ways about matters that we may wish he had written about in greater detail.

Paul insists that his teaching remains consistent with the message they knew from the beginning. He thus seeks to instill confidence regarding his present argument. In particular, they have previously been informed about the coming of the man of lawlessness.

<span id="page-339-4"></span>2:6 When Paul declares, "You know what is restraining him now," we again confront our lack of firsthand knowledge. Paul's original audience "knew" such matters based on Paul's prior instruction (2:5), but we are left to infer as much as we can to the best of our abilities. This is particularly difficult, and one of the most avid debates among modern commentators concerns the question of who or what is restraining the lawless one's appearance.

<span id="page-339-5"></span>Before considering the options, note that verse 6 speaks of some *entity* (neuter gender in Gk.) that is restraining the lawless one, while verse 7 shifts to the masculine gender, implying that the restrainer is some *person* ("he who now restrains it"). It seems that some personal entity must cease his restraining action in order for the lawless one to be revealed. This could be metaphorical for a group of people, but it seems likely Paul has a single individual in mind.

<span id="page-339-6"></span>Interpreters have considered multiple options for this "restrainer." Many suggest that God himself restrains such evil, perhaps especially in the person of the Holy Spirit. Others believe Paul has some earthly agents in mind, and perhaps the Roman emperors or the empire itself held back the lawless one in Paul's day. This is possible, though such postulations often require a metaphorical expansion of "he who now restrains" to indicate an entire nation or a series of emperors rather than a single individual. Some have even suggested that Satan is the one restraining his own lawless agent until the proper moment (cf. 2:9–10). However, the mention in verse 6 of "in his time" seems to speak more of God's sovereign timing that governs the removing of restraint. An intriguing recent monograph argues that Paul believed the restrainer to be an angel of God, noting that, in Daniel, the lawless ruler who establishes the abomination of desolation (Dan. 11:20–45) is followed immediately by Daniel's prophecy that Michael the archangel would "arise," unleashing a time of trouble prior to the deliverance of God's people (Dan. 12:1–4).2 With this list of options, it appears most likely that God himself controls

<span id="page-339-1"></span><span id="page-339-0"></span><sup>2</sup> Colin R. Nicholl, *From Hope to Despair in Thessalonica: Situating 1 and 2 Thessalonians*, SNTSMS 126 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), esp. 225–249.

the timing and the restraint, holding back the advent of the lawless one until the proper moment. God may then be the restrainer (perhaps specifically as the Holy Spirit) or may act through the agency of an angelic restrainer.

<span id="page-340-10"></span>What can be stated clearly is that the appearance of the lawless one is entirely in keeping with God's sovereignty (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 2:11–12). Therefore, the Thessalonians need not fear that the world is out of control. Rather, the lawless one will appear "in his time" and will be conquered by the Lord Jesus at the proper moment (2:8).

<span id="page-340-11"></span><span id="page-340-8"></span><span id="page-340-7"></span>2:7 Although the lawless one is yet to come, "the mystery of lawlessness is already at work." This is consistent with the concept of evil elsewhere in the NT. John states simultaneously that the "antichrist is coming" and that "now many antichrists have come" (1 John 2:18; cf. 1 John 2:22; 4:3; 2 John 7). Although Paul prophetically anticipates the rise of a particular figure who will embody deceptive opposition to God, he admits readily that the same forces of deception and lawlessness are already prevalent in society. Paul has experienced such evil, as has the persecuted church in Thessalonica.

<span id="page-340-9"></span><span id="page-340-0"></span>To the extent that the lawless one comes with "false signs and wonders" and "deception" (2 Thess. 2:9–10), it is helpful to remember that Jesus predicted that many false messiahs and prophets would arise over time but that the church will nevertheless endure and give witness (Matt. 24:4–5, 11–13, 23–25). Thus we live in an age when simultaneously the Spirit enables the church to proceed with its mission and lawlessness is at work.

<span id="page-340-12"></span><span id="page-340-6"></span><span id="page-340-5"></span><span id="page-340-4"></span><span id="page-340-3"></span><span id="page-340-1"></span>The verbs Paul applies here to lawlessness is the same as language he uses elsewhere of God and Christ. If in 2:7 lawlessness is "at work" (Gk. *energeō*; cf. Rom. 7:5; Eph. 2:2), so also the word of God is "at work" in believers (1 Thess. 2:13; cf. Eph. 1:11, 20; 3:20; Phil. 2:13). Similarly, if in 2:9 the lawless one will "come" (Gk. *parousia*), so also Jesus "comes" (2 Thess. 2:1, 8; cf. comment on 2:9). The man of lawlessness will be "revealed" (Gk. *apokalyptō*; 2:3, 8), just as Paul elsewhere speaks of the revelation of Jesus and his gospel (cf. comment on 2:3–4). Finally, the word "mystery" is here applied to lawlessness (for similar evil mysteries, cf. Rev. 17:5, 7), but elsewhere Paul speaks of God as the author of the mysteries of the gospel (e.g., Rom. 16:25; 1 Cor. 4:1; 15:51; Eph. 3:3–4; Col. 1:26–27; 1 Tim. 3:9, 16). Clearly the lawlessness of Satan seeks to mimic the good work of God in Christ. Yet since God is the one who reveals such mysteries and is sovereign over their timing, it is not surprising to find Paul confident in God's control over the advent of the mystery of lawlessness (cf. 2 Thess. 2:11–12).

<span id="page-340-2"></span>Lawlessness in the present age ("now") is not yet as bad as it could be. Only when "he who now restrains it" is removed will the lawless one arise (2:7). Various views on this restrainer's identity were discussed in the preceding verse. Here we note that "until he is out of the way" is an English idiom for the more particular Greek phrase "until he comes from the middle." The restrainer interposes himself between the people of this age and the fullest expression of evil represented by the lawless one.

<span id="page-341-9"></span><span id="page-341-7"></span>2:8 Paul returns to the revelation of the lawless one (cf. comment on 2:3–4), which will occur subsequent ("then") to the restrainer's ceasing his action of holding back such evil. However, lest the Thessalonians become concerned about the power of such evil, Paul quickly assures them that the Lord Jesus will "kill" and "bring to nothing" the lawless one.

<span id="page-341-1"></span><span id="page-341-0"></span>Jesus will destroy the lawless one by the "breath of his mouth." In the OT, God kills with his fiery breath (Job 4:9; cf. Isa. 30:33). Isaiah prophesied that the messianic "shoot from the stump of Jesse" would kill the wicked "with the breath of his lips" (Isa. 11:1, 4). The word "breath" here ( *pneuma*) is the same word used for the Holy Spirit, so there may be some indication of the Spirit's involvement. In any case, the OT messianic resonances are clear: the Messiah's judgment prevails against all lawlessness.

The Thessalonians (and all Christians) need not worry about the approaching time of lawlessness, for Jesus remains Lord, and he will conquer in due time.

<span id="page-341-10"></span>2:9–10 Empowered by Satan, the lawless one will arrive accompanied by false wonders and signs, thus deceiving unbelievers; but even this is under God's sovereign control (2:11–12).

<span id="page-341-11"></span><span id="page-341-6"></span>Paul again applies to the lawless one and Satan terms typically reserved for God's activity in Christ. The "coming" (Gk. *parousia*) of the lawless one in verse 9 is placed immediately alongside the *parousia* of Jesus (2:8; cf. also comment on 2:1), and Satan's "activity" uses a term often employed for God's work (*energeia*; cf. comment on 2:7). Satan mimics God's work by causing a lawless one to appear, though ultimately Satan's designs will fail (cf. 2:8).

<span id="page-341-8"></span><span id="page-341-5"></span><span id="page-341-3"></span>Paul lists two sets of means through which Satan deceives the masses. The first set constitutes "all power," along with "false signs and wonders"; the second set consists of "all wicked deception." Concerning the first set, "power" and "signs and wonders" often serve as evidence of God's work in the gospel of Christ (for "power," cf. 1 Cor. 2:4–5; 1 Thess. 1:5; 2 Thess. 1:11; for "signs and wonders," cf. Rom. 15:19; 2 Cor. 12:12). So, Satan continues mimicking the gospel and God's work. We are again reminded of Jesus' Olivet Discourse, in which he warns of coming false messiahs and prophets who perform "signs and wonders" in order to lead others astray (Matt. 24:23–25; Mark 13:21–23). Jesus' teaching has set the pattern for apostolic discussions of eschatology. In this regard, this passage is linked with the portrayal of the beasts and the false prophet in the book of Revelation (Rev. 13:11–18; 16:13–14; 19:19–20).

<span id="page-341-13"></span><span id="page-341-12"></span><span id="page-341-4"></span><span id="page-341-2"></span>The man of lawlessness is so convincing to the masses that Paul emphasizes that he appears with "*all* wicked deception." However, even amid such deception, Paul carefully records that only "those who are perishing" will be fooled (cf. Rev. 13:8). This word for "perishing" (Gk. *apollymi* ) refers to those whose destruction awaits them. Paul uses *apollymi* elsewhere to depict those who reject the gospel of Christ (1 Cor. 1:18; 2 Cor. 2:15; 4:3). Because these followers of lawlessness have failed to love the truth of Christ's gospel, they are perishing. The Thessalonians need not worry that they may be numbered among those who will be deceived by the man of lawlessness, since they already know and love the truth.

<span id="page-342-11"></span><span id="page-342-7"></span>2:11–12 In light of their refusal to love the truth ("therefore"), God turns those who are perishing over to falsehood and condemnation. More specifically God "sends them" what Paul calls a "strong delusion" (Gk. *energeia planēs*; "power of deceit"). Satan exercises "activity" (*energeia*) in 2:9, but God is truly the one sovereignly at work. The mechanism for "sending" this deceitful power is not specified; however, Satan's activity, working through the lawless one's methods of deception, is unwittingly coopted into a grander cosmic drama, over which God remains ultimately in control.

<span id="page-342-10"></span>The purpose of such delusion is to lead those who are perishing into further erroneous thoughts and practices ("so that they may believe what is false"; v. 11). This results ultimately in their well-deserved judgment ("in order that all may be condemned"; v. 12).

<span id="page-342-12"></span>Those who are condemned are defined further in verse 12 as those "who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness." These people rebuffed the true theology of the Christian gospel and the Scriptures, with such unbelief already witnessed in their refusal to love the truth (cf. 2:10). Moreover, they intentionally engaged in immorality (i.e., they "had pleasure in unrighteousness").

<span id="page-342-9"></span>The meaning of verses 11–12 is fairly straightforward, as are the implications for the Thessalonians. This persecuted church can be encouraged that their worldview, rooted in the gospel of Jesus and the apostolic instruction, explains the lack of faith and the multiplication of unrighteousness surrounding them. Amid this cosmic battle, they should ally themselves with God rather than with Satan.

<span id="page-342-13"></span>However, these verses also provide a theological challenge. God is never the author of sin, nor does he tempt anyone (James 1:13–15). How is it, then, that God could send delusion on unbelievers in order to reinforce their unbelief and hedonism, resulting in their ultimate destruction? Paul is not interested in discussing such matters of theodicy here; he is content to leave us with the theological mystery. Yet the context provides some help, since the sequence of verses 9 to 12 indicates that many refuse to love the truth, and so God uses Satanic delusion to condemn these people for their hardness of heart.

<span id="page-342-8"></span><span id="page-342-6"></span><span id="page-342-5"></span><span id="page-342-4"></span><span id="page-342-3"></span><span id="page-342-2"></span><span id="page-342-1"></span><span id="page-342-0"></span>Elsewhere in Scripture God works in similar ways. For example, Pharaoh hardened his own heart against God and his people (Ex. 7:14, 22; 8:15, 19, 32; 9:7), and God subsequently further hardened Pharaoh's heart to refuse to do good (Ex. 9:12; 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 8), knowing in advance that all of this would result in judgment on Pharaoh (Ex. 4:21; 7:3). Further biblical examples can be found of God's using wicked people and spirits to produce judgment (and for other ultimately good purposes; Gen. 50:15–21; 1 Sam. 16:14; 1 Kings 22:19–23 [cf. 2 Chron. 18:18–22]; Jer. 20:1–6; 21:1–10; Lam. 2:1–2; Ezek. 14:6–11; Mark 14:18–21, 43–46, 64–65; 15:13–15; Acts 2:23; 4:24–28; Rev. 17:15–17). God is not the author of sin. Yet the Lord is sovereign over sinful actors, controlling

even Satan's wicked designs for his own good purposes, including the judgment of those who oppose him.

### *Response*

Christians should long for the second coming of Jesus, fearing neither the signs to precede it nor the judgment to follow. To the believer, Christ's second advent means participating in Jesus' glory, and so the signs preceding it can be endured by the grace of Christ. We should, however, be wary of those who make predictions about the end, knowing that many have been led astray by false apocalyptic teaching.

God remains sovereign over all events, including the rise of the lawless one in the last days. We need not fear the activity of Satan, even if we must always be vigilant against his designs. Jesus Christ is the victor in the cosmic battle, and God will deliver his children safely through this age unto their eternal home. Although lawlessness may increase in this world and further persecutions ensue, confidence in Jesus allows the church to stand firm. We live in an age in which lawlessness opposes the good work of the gospel, but God has interposed a restrainer until the proper moment, and the Spirit empowers the gospel message to go forth. Until the end, the Christian vocation is to love and believe the truth of the gospel, following Jesus in all of life and loving others in his name, all the while knowing that the vindication of Christ and his church will come in good time.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-343-1"></span><span id="page-343-0"></span>As in their previous letter (1 Thess. 2:13; 3:11–13), Paul and his colleagues insert both a thanksgiving to God (2 Thess. 2:13–14) and a benedictory prayer (vv. 16–17) in the middle of this letter. The authors here return to the theme of the confidence <span id="page-344-8"></span>they have in the Thessalonian believers (vv. 13–14). This church represents the firstfruits of those who are saved in their region: they are chosen and called by God, sanctified by the Spirit, and faithful to the truth of the gospel. Their destiny is glory. In light of these truths, Paul again encourages the church to stand firm by following the apostolic teaching (v. 15). Then Paul speaks a benedictory invocation of comfort on the believers (vv. 16–17).

### <span id="page-344-10"></span><span id="page-344-9"></span>*Section Outline*

III.B. Further Thanksgiving and Admonition to Stand Firm (2:13–17)

- 1. Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians' Election and Calling (2:13–14)
- 2. Admonition to Stand Firm (2:15)
- 3. Paul's Benedictory Prayer for the Church (2:16–17)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-344-7"></span><span id="page-344-6"></span>2:13 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy commence this statement of thanksgiving with the same language they used in the epistle's opening thanksgiving (cf. 1:3). The earlier thanksgiving focused on the church's response to the gospel message amid their growing faith and increasing love. This thanksgiving is directed entirely toward God's saving and electing call.

The word "beloved" encourages further confidence among these Thessalonian believers in their relationship to the Lord. This designation also provides a basis for their election and calling, for it is out of the Lord's love and grace that he has called them to himself.

<span id="page-344-5"></span>God "chose" them. This particular verb is rare in the NT (Gk. *haireō*; cf. Phil. 1:22; Heb. 11:25), referring to the selection of someone for a specific purpose. Other synonymous terms (e.g., Gk. *hairetizō*, *eklektos*, *eklegomai* ) elsewhere speak of God's choosing people for various purposes, especially his electing them for salvation (e.g., Matt. 22:14; John 15:16; Acts 13:17; Rev. 17:14). Paul himself employs such election language for God's gracious choice of believers unto salvation (e.g., Rom. 11:5; Eph. 1:4; Col. 1:27; 3:12; cf. comment on 1 Thess. 1:4).

<span id="page-344-2"></span><span id="page-344-1"></span><span id="page-344-0"></span>In this context, God chose these Thessalonians "as the firstfruits to be saved." The word "firstfruits" (Gk. *aparchē*) refers to the early produce of a harvest (e.g., Ex. 23:19; Lev. 2:12; 23:10). These Thessalonians were among the first believers to experience salvation in their region. Paul celebrates this, assuring them that God has granted them salvation and implying that others will be added to the church as additional fruit.

<span id="page-344-4"></span><span id="page-344-3"></span>The means God has employed in their salvation include "sanctification by the Spirit" and "belief in the truth." The word "sanctification" refers to being rendered holy—that is, set apart from unrighteousness unto purity and blamelessness. The Holy Spirit works such sanctification in these believers (e.g., Rom. 15:16; 1 Cor. 6:11; cf. 1 Thess. 5:23).

<span id="page-345-11"></span>2:14 Paul further remarks, "To this he called you through our gospel." To what were they called? Notably, the Greek word "this" in "to this" (*eis ho*) is neuter in gender, while the immediately preceding nouns are all either feminine or masculine. Thus it is unlikely that Paul is singling out any particular term from verse 13 (whether "firstfruits," "saved," "sanctification," "belief," or "truth"). Rather, the whole salvific content of verse 13 is in view. The believers are called to be the firstfruits of salvation through sanctification and faith.

<span id="page-345-14"></span><span id="page-345-9"></span><span id="page-345-3"></span>The "calling" of God indicates his summoning his people unto salvation and sanctification through his own purpose and grace (cf. 2 Tim. 1:9; and comments on 1 Thess. 1:4; 2:11–12; 4:7; 5:23–24). Conceptually, such "calling" follows logically from the election described by "God chose you" (2 Thess. 2:13). God used the good news of Jesus Christ crucified and risen, as preached by Paul and his colleagues, to summon them to the salvation for which he had already chosen them from before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). The purpose of God's electing call here is "so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ." The word "obtain" is a noun in Greek ( *peripoiēsis*), referring to their "possession" of glory. This provides a stark contrast with "those who are perishing" a few verses earlier (2 Thess. 2:10–12).

<span id="page-345-8"></span><span id="page-345-1"></span>The Thessalonian church can be confident that the God who loves them has enacted his election and calling, drawing them to his salvation through the Spirit's sanctifying work and their belief in the truth of the gospel. The ultimate outcome of this salvation will be glory for the believers at the appearance of Christ.

<span id="page-345-12"></span><span id="page-345-10"></span><span id="page-345-5"></span><span id="page-345-0"></span>2:15 In light of the wonderful truths in 2:13–14, Paul again exhorts the Thessalonians to "stand firm" and endure (cf. comments on 1:4–5; 1 Thess. 3:8). Paul directs them to hold fast to what he and his colleagues have taught them. Their foundational instruction in the Christian faith, though cut short when Paul and his team were forced to leave Thessalonica (Acts 17:5–10), continues to provide the Thessalonians with the needed teaching for living as Christians. This early personal instruction was supplemented by Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians. Thus the original "spoken word" from Paul's time in Thessalonica (and Timothy's subsequent visit; cf. 1 Thess. 3:1–6) was accompanied by "our letter," i.e., 1 Thessalonians.

<span id="page-345-13"></span><span id="page-345-7"></span><span id="page-345-4"></span><span id="page-345-2"></span>2:16 As in the earlier letter (1 Thess. 3:11–13), Paul and his colleagues close the first major portion of this letter with a benediction, invoking God's blessing on the church. In both cases, these benedictions are aligned with the specific concerns of the letter. Here Paul beseeches God to "comfort" and "establish" the Thessalonians, connecting well with the need for this afflicted church to experience solace and to continue to stand fast.

<span id="page-345-6"></span>Paul presents these requests to both God the Father and the Lord Jesus (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 3:11). In offering prayer to Jesus alongside God the Father, Paul clearly acknowledges their distinct persons while also asserting that Jesus <span id="page-346-0"></span>possesses the parallel authority and attributes of deity that permit him to receive prayer and to be named in the same terms as the Father. While in many places Paul asserts the full deity of Christ overtly (e.g., Rom. 1:3–4; 9:5; Phil. 2:5–11; Col. 1:15–20; 2:8–10; Titus 2:13), we also witness Paul's high Christology in these more indirect moments of prayer.

<span id="page-346-6"></span><span id="page-346-1"></span>Two particular descriptors are applied to God: he is the one who "loved us" and who "gave us" both comfort and hope. The mention of love emphasizes further the status of the Thessalonian believers as "beloved by the Lord" (2 Thess. 2:13). Similarly, God has already given these believers "eternal comfort," which anticipates the petition Paul presents in verse 17 for God to "comfort your hearts." God has also already granted these believers "good hope through grace." Such "hope" will be needed as the Thessalonians endure affliction in this life.

<span id="page-346-8"></span>2:17 Although God has already given the Thessalonians comfort and hope (v. 16), Paul petitions God to continue to encourage and console them. In modern idiom, the "heart" is the seat of human emotions; in Paul's day, however, the heart was the seat of the entire person (especially the intellect). Paul asks for their anxieties to be calmed and their hurts to be consoled.

<span id="page-346-3"></span>Additionally, Paul prays for these believers' hearts to be established "in every good work and word." Similarly, Paul's benediction in 1 Thessalonians 3:13 petitioned God to "establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father." The verb "to establish" connects with Paul's earlier admonition to "stand firm" (2 Thess. 2:15). Hence Paul prays for God to grant the church the very endurance he had earlier directed the believers to live out.

<span id="page-346-7"></span><span id="page-346-5"></span><span id="page-346-2"></span>More specifically, this endurance is to be evidenced by spiritual fruit. The performance of good works, while by no means earning meritorious favor unto salvation, flows from the fruit of the Spirit's work in the life of the already saved believer (cf. comment on 1:11). Paul also knows it is important for believers not only to act rightly but also to speak words of grace and love (e.g., Col. 4:6; 1 Tim. 4:12; Titus 2:7–8). This prayer provides a fitting transition to the next chapter, with its concluding admonitions.

### <span id="page-346-9"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-346-4"></span>Paul and his colleagues again model missional and pastoral care (cf. Response section on 2 Thess. 1:1–12). Paul's thanksgiving and benediction are tailored to the needs of the congregation, especially for confidence in salvation, for comfort, and for the strength to endure afflictions from Thessalonian society. Paul readily assures his readers that God's electing call provides them with the security of salvation. Moreover, they can await confidently the glory that will come to Christ's faithful followers when Jesus returns.

Believers in every age are compelled to stand firm, holding on to the gospel and the apostolic teaching of Scripture. Although the challenges to the church vary depending on time and place, ultimately we find ourselves arrayed confidently

against human and spiritual forces that oppose the gospel of Christ. Eternal victory is assured to those who persevere by Christ's strength.

God has already declared his love for his church, and he has already granted us comfort and hope; yet we should also kneel before God on behalf of our fellow believers, asking that they experience this comfort and that we all may be established in every good "work and word." Ultimately, God's grace will prevail, and thus we ask daily for his grace to be active in our lives.

### <span id="page-347-1"></span>OVERVIEW OF

### 2 THESSALONIANS 3:1–15

As in their first epistle, Paul and his colleagues transition from the mid-epistle benediction to a series of admonitions to the Thessalonians. First, they continue to encourage the church to remain steadfast amid the challenges of a culture opposed to Christ. The central paragraph calls for church members not to fall into idleness but to work heartily. Returning to themes from earlier in the letter, this section concludes with an exhortation not to grow weary in doing good works and a warning against any who disregard the apostolic teaching.

### *Section Overview*

Paul and his colleagues ask the Thessalonians to pray on behalf of the Pauline mission in order that the gospel would spread and that their ministry would be protected. Paul also reminds the church that the faithful Lord will defend them. He expresses confidence in the Thessalonians, focusing on their obedient response and on how the Lord will root them in love and endurance.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-348-10"></span><span id="page-348-6"></span>3:1–2 As in their earlier letter (1 Thess. 4:1), Paul and his colleagues transition via the word "finally" from a mid-letter benediction to a series of admonitions. This use of "finally" in the middle of the letter serves to shift the discourse and to introduce important new material (also Phil. 3:1; cf. comment on 1 Thess. 4:1).

<span id="page-348-8"></span><span id="page-348-7"></span><span id="page-348-3"></span>Paul requests the brothers and sisters in the church to "pray for us" (cf. 1 Thess. 5:25). As Paul and his colleagues pray regularly for the Thessalonians (2 Thess. 1:11), so they also invite the church to pray on their behalf. Church members (vocational ministers and laity alike) should participate regularly in mutual prayer for one another.

<span id="page-348-5"></span><span id="page-348-4"></span><span id="page-348-0"></span>Paul first invites the Thessalonians to pray that "the word of the Lord" would be spread through the ministry of Paul and his team (cf. Col. 4:3). The word of the Lord is the good news of Christ, focused on Jesus' teaching, death, and resurrection (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 1:8–10; 4:15). Specifically, Paul asks that the word of the Lord would both "speed ahead" and "be honored." The Greek word for "speed ahead" (*trechō*) refers literally to running; Paul requests via this idiom for the gospel to progress quickly through the Roman world (cf. Ps. 147:15). The term for "be honored" (Gk. *doxazō*) anticipates that this gospel would be extolled as glorious by those who receive it (cf. 2 Thess. 3:1 ESV mg.). Thus Paul petitions that the gospel of Christ would spread far and deep, penetrating throughout the empire and being embraced fully by the recipients. Paul also inserts a reassuring remark to the Thessalonians ("as happened among you"), indicating that he and his colleagues—the Thessalonians' fathers in the faith—affirm gladly that the word of the Lord is active and honored in the Thessalonian church.

<span id="page-348-13"></span><span id="page-348-12"></span><span id="page-348-11"></span><span id="page-348-9"></span><span id="page-348-2"></span><span id="page-348-1"></span>Second, Paul asks that he and his colleagues "may be delivered from wicked and evil men" (3:2). This word for "wicked" (Gk. *atopos*) is somewhat rare in the NT. It designates something that is out of place; idiomatically, it may refer to perverse and twisted behavior (cf. Luke 23:41; Acts 25:5). Paul knows the present age is "evil" (Gal. 1:4; also Eph. 5:16), filled with opposition to God and under the influence of the Evil One (2 Thess. 3:3), even while the Lord steadily builds his church. In the age to come, God will deliver his people from evil and grant them eternal salvation (2 Tim. 4:18), but Paul's concerns here are more immediate. Throughout Paul's missionary travels, he and his colleagues encountered much opposition to the gospel,

<span id="page-349-14"></span><span id="page-349-2"></span>as the Thessalonians would recall (Acts 17:5–10). With apparent understatement, Paul remarks in verse 2 that "not all have faith." Paul and his colleagues ask for prayer that their ministry might go forth amid such human opposition, even as the Lord provides times of deliverance in their daily lives and mission.

<span id="page-349-17"></span>Sometimes God's deliverance results in immediate relief from opposition; on other occasions, however, our ability to perceive God's rescuing hand requires a long-range view of God's work both in this world and to eternity (e.g., 2 Tim. 3:10–13; 4:15–18). We often require God's wisdom to recognize and appreciate the surprising directions that his providential deliverance follows.

<span id="page-349-9"></span><span id="page-349-8"></span><span id="page-349-7"></span>3:3 In contrast to the faithlessness of the unbelievers in this world (3:2), the Lord is faithful (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 5:23–24). He is trustworthy, for he always acts consistently with his holy, just, and loving character. Since "Lord" is a biblical title for both God the Father and Jesus Christ, it can be difficult to know for certain in some contexts whether Paul refers to the first or second person of the Trinity (e.g., 2 Thess. 1:9; 2:2, 13; 3:1, 3, 4, 5, 16). Concerning this verse, we note that Paul most commonly applies the term "Lord" to Jesus in this epistle (1:1, 2, 7, 8, 12; 2:8, 14, 16; 3:6, 12, 18; cf. also comment on 1 Thess. 1:1); on the other hand, Paul typically speaks of God the Father as "faithful" (1 Cor. 1:9; 10:13; 2 Cor. 1:18). Thus the interpretive evidence goes in different directions. Of course, Paul affirms the faithfulness and universal lordship of both of these members of the Trinity, and in Paul's benedictions he commonly invokes the sovereign work of both in the life of the believer (2 Thess. 2:16–17).

<span id="page-349-13"></span><span id="page-349-12"></span><span id="page-349-5"></span><span id="page-349-3"></span>Since the Lord is faithful, the Thessalonians can be assured that he will both "establish you" and "guard you against the evil one." Just a few verses earlier (cf. comment on 2:17), Paul had prayed for the Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father to "establish" the believers' hearts in "every good work and word." Thus Paul expresses confidence in 3:3 that the faithful triune God will indeed work in precisely the way Paul prayed for in 2:17.

<span id="page-349-18"></span><span id="page-349-15"></span><span id="page-349-10"></span><span id="page-349-6"></span><span id="page-349-1"></span><span id="page-349-0"></span>Paul informs the church confidently that God will "guard you against the evil one." The "evil one" is the Devil/Satan (e.g., Matt. 13:38–39; Eph. 6:11, 16; 1 John 3:8–12), the fallen angelic adversary of God's people (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:17–18). Jesus teaches us to pray for God's protection against the Evil One (Matt. 6:13; John 17:15), and Paul has previously affirmed the sovereignty of God over Satan (cf. 2 Thess. 2:6–12 and comments). Given the bleak truth about Satan's coming activity through the man of lawlessness (esp. 2:9–10), the Thessalonians must have been comforted by Paul's statement here, with its assurance of the Lord's work to establish and protect them.

<span id="page-349-16"></span><span id="page-349-11"></span><span id="page-349-4"></span>3:4 Paul and his colleagues continue to express confidence in the Lord on behalf of the church. Paul's confidence is not directly "in the church" but rather "in the Lord" (cf. Gal. 5:10; Phil. 2:24). Paul trusts the Lord to fortify his church unto obedience to the apostolic instruction. Note how he affirms their obedience both in the present and in the future. This statement of confidence encourages these believers in multiple ways, reminding the reader that they are "in the Lord," that the Lord is ultimately the agent who works obedience among them, and that Paul already appreciates their current obedience and has good reason to hope for their future Christian diligence. This verse also indirectly reminds the readers to follow Paul's apostolic teaching.

<span id="page-350-2"></span><span id="page-350-0"></span>3:5 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy insert another brief benedictory prayer amid these admonitions. The "steadfastness of Christ" likely indicates the endurance Christ exemplified during his earthly ministry. Consequently, the parallel construction "love of God" speaks of God's love for the Thessalonians (cf. 2 Thess. 2:13, 16; cf. Rom. 5:5; 8:39; 2 Cor. 13:14). Thus Paul petitions the Lord to direct the Thessalonians' "hearts" (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 2:17) to contemplate both God's love for them and Jesus' endurance. Such contemplation will embolden them further in their own perseverance and love.

### <span id="page-350-1"></span>*Response*

Those in ministry should follow Paul's lead in inviting others to pray for our work. Similarly, it is a high calling to pray for others as they engage in gospel ministry, including missionaries, ministers, and ministry volunteers. Note how Paul's prayer desires both extensive and intensive growth of the gospel—that it would go to many places and grow deeply in the hearts of those who respond. This forms a wonderfully balanced vision for gospel expansion.

God is indeed faithful. Thus we need not fear human or demonic opposition, since the Lord establishes and defends his people. We should publicly express confidence in the work of God among believers around us, for such expressions provide great encouragement to others and follow the apostolic model (3:4). Finally, our Christian walk should be marked by hearts directed "to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ."

### <span id="page-350-3"></span>2 THESSALONIANS 3:6–12

**<sup>6</sup>**Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us. **7**For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you, **8**nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you. **<sup>9</sup>** It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate. **10**For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to

work, let him not eat. **11**For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies. **12**Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.*<sup>1</sup>*

1Greek *to eat their own bread*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-351-7"></span>Some in Thessalonica refused to work (2 Thess. 3:11), so Paul and his colleagues remind the church of their previous instruction: those who can work should do so (vv. 10–12). Indeed, Paul and his team previously modeled an industrious approach to labor.

### *Section Outline*

The word "command" combined with "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" in the opening and closing verses of this paragraph forms an *inclusio* (repeating the same key terms at the beginning and end of a section for emphasis). For this reason, 3:6–12 likely forms a single coherent paragraph, with 3:13 beginning a new section.

<span id="page-351-9"></span>IV.B. Directive to Work and Cease from Idleness (3:6–12)

- 1. Keep Away from the Idle Brother (3:6)
- 2. Paul's Example (3:7–9)
- 3. Paul's Command (3:10)
- 4. Directive to the Idle Brother (3:11–12)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-351-4"></span><span id="page-351-3"></span><span id="page-351-2"></span><span id="page-351-1"></span>3:6 Several features emphasize the importance Paul attaches to these instructions. First, this paragraph receives more space than any other admonition in chapter 3. Second, Paul opens with the words "we command you," reminding the reader that only two verses earlier he has expressed confidence that the Thessalonians "are doing and will do the things that we command" (3:4). Third, Paul delivers this charge in verse 6 "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (cf. 1 Cor. 5:4; 6:11; Eph. 5:20; Col. 3:17), adding extra solemnity to his words (cf., e.g., Acts 16:18). Fourth, Paul returns to the "command" vocabulary as an *inclusio* at the paragraph's end (2 Thess. 3:12), with such repetition highlighting the importance of his directives. Finally, the example of Paul and his team provides a model of the diligent behavior they demand in this passage (3:7–10).

<span id="page-351-8"></span><span id="page-351-6"></span><span id="page-351-5"></span><span id="page-351-0"></span>Verse 6 commands believers to avoid anyone in the church who refuses to work. The person to be avoided is specifically labeled a "brother." The verb translated "keep away" (Gk. *stellō*) is rare in the NT, but lexicons understand it to denote the shunning or avoidance of someone. The brother to be avoided walks in "idleness," with the Greek word (*ataktōs*) referring to behavior that is undisciplined, disorderly, or defying social convention. In context, this unruly conduct takes particular form in a person's refusal to work or earn his own living (esp. 3:10–12).

<span id="page-352-4"></span>This undisciplined idleness runs counter to the instruction Paul and his colleagues have delivered to the church ("the tradition that you received from us"). Paul and company taught in Thessalonica about the importance of dutiful work (3:10; also 1 Thess. 4:11), which they also modeled to the believers by apostolic example (2 Thess. 3:7–10). Moreover, the same directive had been restated in their previous letter (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 4:10–12; 5:14).

<span id="page-352-11"></span><span id="page-352-9"></span><span id="page-352-7"></span><span id="page-352-3"></span>This admonition to "keep away" from the idle brother, with notions of shunning and avoidance, may sound harsh to modern ears, yet Paul does not demand cutting them off from all forms of contact, since a few verses later he presumes that these idle brothers will be present in the congregation to hear this instruction (3:12). Moreover, Paul is concerned that the church could be pressured into providing assistance to people who are fully capable of working. This would draw resources away from the truly needy (cf., e.g., 1 Tim. 5:3, 9–10) and would enable the freeloaders to busy themselves in ways morally destructive to them and damaging to others in the church (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 3:10–12). Also, these loafers have been previously instructed to find employment, and their refusal to heed the apostolic mandate points to deeper spiritual problems. Therefore, the church must avoid supporting them in any way, and believers should be careful in their interactions with such people in order to discourage their slothfulness and moral indolence (cf. also 3:14–15).

<span id="page-352-10"></span><span id="page-352-8"></span><span id="page-352-6"></span><span id="page-352-5"></span>A number of commentators attempt to link this problem of idleness with eschatology, another major concern in 2 Thessalonians. Some have speculated that an apocalyptic millenarian fervor, especially one assuming that the day of the Lord was already upon the believers in Thessalonica (2:2), had led some church members to forsake their work in civil society, under the assumption that such work would be unnecessary when Christ returns. Paul himself, however, makes no explicit connection between these instructions and his earlier discussion of eschatology.

<span id="page-352-2"></span><span id="page-352-1"></span><span id="page-352-0"></span>More importantly, Paul had been concerned from his earliest days in Thessalonica that some in the church were inclined to laziness and sloth, which is why he began instructing the congregation about this even while he was in Thessalonica (3:10). Such early instruction almost certainly occurred before any Christian apocalyptic speculation could have run rampant among these new believers. Furthermore, Paul and his colleagues addressed the issue of work and idleness in their first letter (1 Thess. 2:9–10; 4:11–12; 5:14), and there is little in that letter to suggest apocalyptic speculation had driven congregants toward an avoidance of work (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 4:10–12). It seems more likely that Paul is concerned that the Greco-Roman model of itinerant pagan philosophers may be promoting an avoidance of work, perhaps also demeaning those who engage in manual labor (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 2:9–10). Paul also encourages other congregations toward respecting manual labor (Eph. 4:28; Col. 3:23–24). Hence, this tendency to idleness at Thessalonica is likely tied to cultural assumptions in Greco-Roman society. Beyond that, the Scriptures have long recognized a sinful human propensity to sloth (Prov. 12:24, 27; 19:15; 31:27; Eccles. 10:18; Matt. 25:24–30; Titus 1:12).

<span id="page-353-14"></span><span id="page-353-9"></span>3:7–8 In contrast to the idlers, Paul reminds his audience of the diligent work he and his team displayed in Thessalonica, commending the church to imitate their industrious model (3:9). Imitation is a key theme in Pauline ethics (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 1:6), succinctly stated in his command to "be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:1). The moral example of believers to one another forms a key encouragement and pattern as all seek to follow Christ.

<span id="page-353-12"></span><span id="page-353-8"></span><span id="page-353-5"></span><span id="page-353-1"></span>In contrast to some lazy Thessalonians (2 Thess. 3:6), Paul and his colleagues "were not idle when we were with you." More specifically, they did not "eat anyone's bread without paying for it." Paul was a tentmaker (Acts 18:3) who probably plied his trade "with toil and labor" whenever time allowed (for "night and day," cf. 1 Thess. 2:9; 3:10). Much of this content overlaps with 1 Thessalonians 2:9–10, where Paul notes similarly that he and his colleagues sought not to be a "burden" to the congregation. However, the concerns in 1 Thessalonians focus more on distinguishing their missionary conduct from that of pagan itinerant teachers and philosophers (cf. comments on 1 Thess. 2:5–6; 2:9–10). Here the issue centers on the need to earn one's own living and not burden the church (3:10; cf. Acts 20:33–35).

<span id="page-353-16"></span><span id="page-353-10"></span><span id="page-353-4"></span><span id="page-353-2"></span><span id="page-353-0"></span>3:9 Paul and his team had a right to receive financial compensation from those to whom they were ministering (1 Cor. 9:8–14; 1 Tim. 5:17–18; cf. Luke 10:7–8), but they chose to abandon that right for the sake of the fledgling congregation (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 2:5–6; cf. 1 Cor. 9:3–18; 2 Cor. 11:7–13). Paul again emphasizes the importance of the church's imitating this example of industrious work (cf. 2 Thess. 3:7).

<span id="page-353-17"></span><span id="page-353-13"></span><span id="page-353-6"></span><span id="page-353-3"></span>3:10 Their example in Thessalonica also came with instruction: "If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat." Paul is not rejecting the giving of alms to truly needy individuals or churches (cf., e.g., Acts 24:17; Rom. 15:25–28; 1 Cor. 16:1–3; 2 Cor. 8:1–5; 1 Tim. 5:3, 9–10), but he is concerned about those who are "not *willing* to work." Their refusal to labor should not be rewarded with church beneficence, lest they become habituated to donations when they could otherwise be productive. Everyone who can work should do so for their own welfare, their families, and the needs of others (Eph. 4:28; 1 Thess. 4:11; 5:14). Paul advises that the natural consequences of such idleness ("let him not eat"; contrast 2 Thess. 3:8) should motivate these idlers to work.

<span id="page-353-18"></span><span id="page-353-15"></span><span id="page-353-7"></span>3:11–12 Paul and his colleagues have received a report about people's "walking in idleness." In addition to causing individual spiritual harm and being a fiscal drain on the church, such refusal to work tends to spill over into other injurious behavior. Thus the idle become "busybodies" (Gk. *periergazomenoi* ), designating those who become intrusively engaged in the activities of others. They begin to meddle in other people's lives, leading to gossip, criticism, and disharmony in the community (cf. comment on 1 Thess. 4:10–12; also 1 Tim. 5:13).

<span id="page-353-11"></span>Paul closes by addressing the idlers directly. The combination of "we command and encourage" emphasizes the directive that follows, as does the solemnity of <span id="page-354-4"></span><span id="page-354-2"></span>"in the Lord Jesus Christ" (cf. 2 Thess. 3:6). They are to "do their work quietly," as Paul states the imperative both to work heartily and to avoid acting as gossiping busybodies or grumbling laborers (contrast 3:11). Paul directs them further to "earn their own living," with the Greek literally indicating that they should "eat their own food" (contrast 3:10).

### <span id="page-354-3"></span>*Response*

Those charged with diaconal ministry often face difficult decisions, since not everyone who asks for help is truly in need. Sponsoring the lazy can simply enable their propensity to avoid work. It may also provide them opportunity to follow unprofitable pursuits, such as gossip, excessive personal entertainment, drugs, sensuality, or other addictive behaviors. It is right and good to be careful about whom we give money and resources, lest those resources be squandered and the recipients ultimately harm themselves spiritually or injure others. At the same time, it is a wonderful ministry to help those who truly are in need. Some people simply cannot work, and they deserve our Christian care. Others need to be supported until they can function as capable workers—through medical assistance, training, counseling, etc.

<span id="page-354-1"></span><span id="page-354-0"></span>Our society sometimes admires the lazy. Movies, books, songs, and other aspects of popular culture can champion those who sit around all day, soaking up the sun, gaming the system for handouts, and playing it cool. Many would prefer not to work but to have every desire in life happily fall into their laps. Yet we must remind ourselves, and instruct others, that God gave mankind good and meaningful work to do even before the fall (Gen. 1:26–28; 2:5–25; cf. the Response section on 1 Thess. 4:9–12). Although humanity's fallen condition at times turns such labor into drudgery and challenge, diligent labor is still to be encouraged as a vital aspect of Christian ethics.

### <span id="page-354-5"></span>2 THESSALONIANS 3:13–15

**<sup>13</sup>**As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. **<sup>14</sup>** If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. **15**Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.

### *Section Overview*

Paul charges the church to persevere in their good works. Paul and his colleagues then underscore the previous instruction in the letter (especially the directives against idleness) by commanding the church to disassociate from those who disobey the apostolic teaching. However, such disobedient participants in the church are still to be considered brothers in the Lord, and they should be warned so that they may repent and experience the full benefits of following the Lord.

### *Section Outline*

IV.C. Do Not Grow Weary, but Warn Others (3:13–15)

- 1. Do Not Grow Weary in Doing Good (3:13)
- 2. Warn the Disobedient Brother (3:14–15)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-355-7"></span><span id="page-355-5"></span>3:13 This short verse forms a hinge between 3:6–12 and the following verses. Given the *inclusio* in 3:6–12 (cf. Section Outline discussion for 3:6–12), verse 13 likely begins a new short paragraph (3:13–15; cf. ESV).

<span id="page-355-3"></span><span id="page-355-2"></span><span id="page-355-0"></span>Paul redirects his address to the whole of the church ("as for you, brothers"; cf. Gal. 4:28; 1 Thess. 5:4). The prohibition here is against growing weary in doing good. The Greek verb for "grow weary" (*enkakeō*) refers to becoming discouraged or losing enthusiasm; it is elsewhere often translated "lose heart" (Luke 18:1; 2 Cor. 4:1, 16; Eph. 3:13). "Doing good" appears in a similar admonition in Galatians 6:9–10, referring to the performance of moral good on behalf of others, especially among believers.

<span id="page-355-8"></span><span id="page-355-4"></span>3:14–15 Paul and his colleagues insist that the church must obey their letter. To modern ears, this may seem overly confident or demanding, but Paul's letter bears apostolic witness that none today can claim. He is also well aware of this young church's tenuous situation amid persecution from their countrymen. Thus Paul rightly asserts the authority and import of his words.

<span id="page-355-9"></span><span id="page-355-1"></span>The Thessalonians are to "note" those who choose to defy the apostolic command and are to "have nothing to do" with them. In a manner akin to keeping away from the idle brother (3:6), they are to disassociate from such a disobedient person (cf. 1 Cor. 5:9, 11). As in 2 Thessalonians 3:6, such shunning does not mean considering the person an enemy or even disavowing the person as a believer (cf. Titus 3:10–11). Rather, the person is to be warned and rebuked. The church avoids such people for the purposes of (1) seeking their good, so that they will repent, and (2) seeking the welfare of the church in society, lest disrepute be brought on the church or other members be tempted to similar disobedience. The connection to 2 Thessalonians 3:6, as well as the context of 3:6–13, may indicate that this command is relevant particularly to the issue of those who refuse to work; however, it is likely that anyone who intentionally and flagrantly transgresses an apostolic command should be similarly warned and disassociated, especially those who teach or exemplify immoral behavior.

### <span id="page-355-6"></span>*Response*

We are not saved by good works, but we honor our crucified and risen Savior as we persevere in doing good for the sake of his name. Those who refuse to pay heed to the clear teaching of Scripture, on the other hand, need to be rebuked by the church, even as we pray for and love them. At times it becomes necessary to disassociate from others when they refuse repeatedly the loving admonition of fellow believers, although we always do so with the caring desire that such erring brothers and sisters may return to following Christ. We should not rush to disassociate from fellow believers, since we all need the mutual support of Christian fellowship in order to remain encouraged in our Christian walk.

### <span id="page-356-4"></span>2 THESSALONIANS 3:16–18

**<sup>16</sup>**Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.

**<sup>17</sup>** I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine; it is the way I write. **18**The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

### *Section Overview*

In these closing words, it is again evident that Paul has been the central author among his colleagues. He invokes peace on the congregation, assures them of his authorship of the letter, and concludes with his regular greeting of grace.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-356-5"></span><span id="page-356-3"></span><span id="page-356-2"></span><span id="page-356-1"></span><span id="page-356-0"></span>3:16 Paul closes with a word of benediction, the third in this letter (cf. 2:16–17; 3:5). With "Lord of peace" we again face the question of whether Paul is referring to the first or the second person of the Trinity (cf. comment on 3:3), though perhaps here the Lord Jesus Christ is most in view (3:18). Paul specifically requests the "Lord of peace" to grant the church that very "peace" that is essential to the Lord's nature. Paul similarly prays for peace to be upon the church in his conclusion to other letters (e.g., Gal. 6:16; Eph. 6:23), much as he often opens his epistles with a similar appeal (cf. comment on 2 Thess. 1:2). The Greek, like the English, emphasizes Paul's request for God to apply this peace to the church in a comprehensive way ("at all times in every way").

<span id="page-357-9"></span><span id="page-357-1"></span>In addition to requesting peace, Paul follows a traditional Jewish blessing by requesting the very presence of the Lord to "be with" everyone in the church (cf. Ruth 2:4; 1 Sam. 20:13; 1 Chron. 22:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). Assuming from the context that "the Lord" likely refers to the Lord Jesus (2 Thess. 3:12, 18), it is remarkable to compare this with the OT, where similar benedictions consistently refer to Yahweh, the covenant name of the Lord God (cf. Deut. 2:7; 20:1; Josh. 1:9; Judg. 6:12, 16; Jer. 42:11; Amos 5:14). Paul's use of a parallel expression for the Lord Jesus implies a very high Christology.

<span id="page-357-6"></span><span id="page-357-3"></span><span id="page-357-2"></span><span id="page-357-0"></span>3:17 Much correspondence in antiquity was written with the assistance of a secretary, or amanuensis, who was trained in penmanship and Greek (cf. Rom. 16:22). Paul, however, interposes text in his "own hand" in this closing greeting. As observed above (cf. comments on 2 Thess. 1:1; 2:5), this indicates that the letter is fundamentally the apostle's work, even though he includes Silvanus and Timothy as coauthors throughout. Paul may have feared that his opponents would attempt to falsify letters in his name (cf. 2:2), so he had developed this means of authenticating his letters (cf. 1 Cor. 16:21; Gal. 6:11; Col. 4:18; Philem. 19).

<span id="page-357-10"></span><span id="page-357-8"></span><span id="page-357-5"></span><span id="page-357-4"></span>3:18 Paul commonly closes his letters with a brief prayer for the Lord's grace to be with all of the church (cf. 1 Thess. 5:28). This standard closing would also serve as a mark of authenticity (like 2 Thess. 3:17). More importantly, Paul's last words in this letter reemphasize his opening focus on grace (1:2).

### <span id="page-357-7"></span>*Response*

Gospel ministers do well to imitate Paul's habit of invoking grace and peace on the people of God; thus church services often conclude with a benediction. However, we can all earnestly pray for peace and grace to be granted to one another. Moreover, in this epistle we are wondrously reminded that Jesus is present among us, since believers are in union with Christ.

# INTRODUCTION TO THE PASTORAL EPISTLES

*Denny Burk*

### *Overview*

<span id="page-359-1"></span>The Pastoral Epistles are so named because they focus squarely on pastoral issues. These epistles are concerned with the order of God's household, which Paul describes as "a pillar and buttress of the truth" (1 Tim. 3:15). They address the roles of men, women, elders, deacons, widows, slaves, and all of the other diverse personalities that contribute to the church's life and worship. These epistles discuss the self-discipline and teaching of church leaders and their responsibility to confront false teaching head-on in the name of Jesus and in the power of the Holy Spirit. Finally, these letters encourage the endurance required of faithful ministers as they pursue a "long obedience in the same direction,"1 as they suffer for the work of the ministry, and even as they face death as a result of preaching the Word.

The Pastoral Epistles are focused on the extraordinary power of the gospel carried out through the ordinary ministries of men who exhibit exemplary character and holiness. These letters are not just for pastors, however; they are for everyone who has a stake in the life and ministry of the local church. Pastors are not the only ones called to give themselves to the Word of God and to holiness. Rather, pastors are called to be examples of gospel fidelity and holy habits. Their lives are to be a template of faithfulness and perseverance for every single member of the congregation.

No titles were originally attached to these books. But, like Paul's other canonical letters, these three books are named after their addressees—in this case Timothy and Titus. The contents of the two letters to Timothy indicate that 1 Timothy was

<span id="page-360-1"></span>written before 2 Timothy, and that order is reflected in the various titles that have been assigned to these letters.

These letters have been known collectively as the "Pastoral Epistles" since at least the eighteenth century.2 Some have suggested that "pastoral epistles" is a misnomer because these three books are by no means "manuals of pastoral theology."3 It is true that these letters are not systematic treatises on pastoral theology, but there are nevertheless reasons for considering them together. First, significant linguistic and conceptual parallels tie these three books together. Second, these are the only books in the Pauline corpus addressed to individuals rather than to churches.4 Third, their subject matter is filled with "pastoral advice" concerning how Timothy and Titus should lead the churches in Ephesus and Crete.

Timothy and Titus are not "pastors" in the usual sense of the term. They do not fill the office of elder/overseer, although they will enforce qualifications for the men who do. Timothy and Titus are more aptly understood as apostolic delegates—both of them sent by Paul to address specific concerns in Ephesus and Crete, respectively.

As apostolic delegates, Timothy and Titus bear a unique authority in their oversight of the churches to which Paul sent them. Certain aspects of their ministries, therefore, may be unique to their own calling and may not have a direct correspondence to ordinary pastoral ministry. As delegates of Paul, they possess a unique authority that no pastor living today could possibly claim for himself.5 Having said that, we can see that some of the responsibilities given to Timothy and Titus overlap directly with the responsibilities of elders/overseers, chief among them being the responsibility to oversee a congregation and to instruct God's people in sound doctrine.

That is, in part, why their teaching and oversight are often regarded as models for pastoral ministry. Timothy and Titus helped to prepare their churches for the transition from the apostolic era to the post-apostolic era, in which churches would be led exclusively by elders and overseers.6 So, while Timothy and Titus do not occupy the office of elder/overseer per se, they do undertake pastoral functions in Ephesus and Crete. This may explain why early church tradition regarded them both as bishops: "Timothy is related to have been the first appointed bishop of the diocese of Ephesus, as was Titus of the churches of Crete" (Eusebius, *Ecclesiastical History*, 3.4.6). Early tradition also suggests that Timothy and Titus returned to Ephesus and Crete later in life to serve as bishops in those places.7

### *Author*

<span id="page-361-0"></span>The letters to Timothy and Titus all claim to have been written by the apostle Paul (1 Tim. 1:1; 2 Tim. 1:1; Titus 1:1). Until recent times, this claim was virtually uncontested. From the earliest days of the Christian church, these letters' authenticity has been widely assumed. Evidence demonstrates that these letters were known and used by Polycarp, Clement of Rome, Justin, Heracleon, and others. The letters also appear in the Muratorian Canon as part of the Pauline letters. Their absence from Marcion's canon and from the Chester Beatty Papyri (P46) is not nearly as significant as critics suggest. Marcion was known for deleting sections of Scripture that failed to fit his theological agenda. The missing leaves from P46 are hardly dispositive.9 All in all, the overwhelming testimony from the earliest witnesses is that the letters to Timothy and Titus were authentically Pauline. This testimony, however, is often eclipsed by the critical mass of modern scholars that denies Pauline authorship. Yet the current majority view is not nearly as impressive when set against what G. K. Chesterton called the "democracy of the dead"—the faith of the church throughout the ages. There can be no question that the democracy of the dead has cast a weighty vote in favor of Pauline authorship.

Nevertheless, this tradition has been vigorously challenged in the modern period. Today, the majority view among scholars is that the Pastoral Epistles were written by a single author under a false name—a practice called pseudonymity. Donald Guthrie summarizes the case against Pauline authorship under four headings: (1) the historical problem, (2) the ecclesiastical problem, (3) the doctrinal problem, and (4) the linguistic problem.10

<span id="page-361-3"></span><span id="page-361-2"></span><span id="page-361-1"></span>(1) The historical problem with Pauline authorship is the alleged difficulty of reconciling historical allusions in these letters to data of the Acts account of Paul's ministry. According to 1 Timothy 1:3, Paul left Timothy to lead the church in Ephesus when the apostle was on his way to Macedonia. Likewise, in Titus 1:5 Paul says that he left Titus in Crete to set things in order there. In 2 Timothy 1:16–17, Paul says that Onesiphorus sought him while he was imprisoned in Rome. Critics allege that these trips to Ephesus and Crete followed by a final Roman imprisonment cannot be reconciled with what we know of Paul's life and ministry from the book of Acts. But this skepticism seems unfounded.

There have been two main approaches to reconciling these historical allusions to Paul's ministry in Acts. One approach says that these historical allusions may be understood within the Acts framework. Those who take this view say that there

<span id="page-361-4"></span><sup>8</sup> The apostle Peter acknowledges such overlap in pastoral duties when he calls himself a "fellow elder" in 1 Peter 5:1.

<sup>9</sup> The foregoing discussion of "external evidence" relies on Guthrie, *New Testament Introduction*, 608–612. See also Philip H. Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, NICNT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2006), 4–7.

<sup>10</sup> The following presentation of the case for and against Pauline authorship follows very closely Guthrie, *New Testament Introduction*, 612–636.

are gaps in the Acts account and that the trips to Ephesus and Crete can be fit into the gaps. Moreover, they argue that the Roman imprisonment in 2 Timothy aligns with the one recorded at the end of Acts. Those who take this point of view differ on some details, but this is the basic approach.

The other approach (and the one adopted in this commentary) posits a second Roman imprisonment of Paul after the narrative of Acts ends. On this view, Paul was released from the Roman imprisonment recorded at the end of Acts. After his release, Paul would have engaged in further ministry and travels, including the trips to Ephesus and Crete. Eventually, Paul was rearrested and put in prison, from which he wrote 2 Timothy while anticipating execution. Although some critics claim that a second Roman imprisonment is an expedient to preserve Pauline authorship, Philip Towner cautions that "the scenario of a release from a first Roman imprisonment should not be too quickly dismissed."11 There is clear evidence that Paul engaged in missionary activity after being released from a Roman captivity (cf. *1 Clem.* 5.7; Muratorian Canon; *Acts of Peter* 1.1; Eusebius, *Ecclesiastical History* 2.22).12

(2) The ecclesiastical problem with Pauline authorship alleges that the letters to Timothy and Titus emphasize church order and office in a way that Paul's earlier, undisputed letters do not. Paul's earlier letters seem to expect an imminent return of Christ. The Pastorals reflect a period in which the imminent return of Christ is no longer expected and in which the church is settling in for the long haul by setting up institutional structures that will preserve the apostolic tradition. In Bart Ehrman's words, "The clerical structure of these letters appears far removed from what we find in the letters of Paul, but it is closely aligned with what we find in proto-orthodox authors of the second century."13

<span id="page-362-4"></span><span id="page-362-3"></span><span id="page-362-0"></span>But the so-called ecclesiastical problem is overblown. Philippians is one of the undisputed letters of Paul, and yet Philippians begins with an address to the "overseers and deacons" (Phil. 1:1). This would be a strange way to address the Philippians if "overseers and deacons" did not become fixtures until the second century. Also, Luke's account of Paul's ministry shows him appointing elders *during* his missionary journeys (cf. comment on Titus 1:5). We note a three-part pattern that Paul pursues in his church-planting efforts in Acts 14:21–23: (1) Paul makes converts through preaching the gospel, (2) he strengthens new believers through discipleship and instruction, and (3) he provides for the appointment of pastors/ elders "in every church" (v. 23) to carry on the work after he is gone. Indeed, one of the most poignant scenes in all of Scripture is Paul's farewell to the Ephesian elders in Acts 20:17–38. Among other things, Paul reminds these elders of the "whole counsel of God" and of their responsibility to "pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the

<span id="page-363-0"></span>church of God, which he obtained with his own blood" (Acts 20:27–28). Unless we are to reject the reliability of Luke's account, we must conclude that from the very beginning of Paul's ministry he was concerned with establishing sound apostolic doctrine through the appointment of elders.

<span id="page-363-5"></span>(3) The doctrinal problem with Pauline authorship alleges that the Pastorals reflect a period in which the Christian faith was becoming a fixed body of doctrinal truth, and that period of concern for confessions and orthodoxy did not emerge until the second century. For example, the emphasis in the Pastorals on "the teaching" suggests a well-defined body of truth conveyed by the apostle and needing to be preserved (e.g., 1 Tim. 4:16; 6:3; 2 Tim. 3:10; 4:3). Likewise, references in the Pastorals to "the faith" suggest a discrete set of Christian truths to be known and propagated (e.g., 1 Tim. 1:10; Titus 1:9, 13). According to Ehrman, this "propositional" use of the term "faith" contrasts with the "relational" emphasis of faith in the undisputed letters. Ehrman concludes, therefore, that the Pastoral Epistles must have been written in a generation after Paul's.14

<span id="page-363-4"></span><span id="page-363-2"></span><span id="page-363-1"></span>There really is no doctrinal problem if one simply observes that Paul's undisputed letters also show Paul's interest in the apostolic faith. In Galatians 1:23, the Christians once persecuted by Paul are recorded as saying of him, "He who used to persecute us is now preaching *the faith* he once tried to destroy" (emphasis mine). In 1 Corinthians 16:13, Paul exhorts the Corinthian believers to "be watchful, stand firm in *the faith*" (emphasis mine). To believe that *faith* is only a "relational" term in the undisputed letters requires the reader to set aside clear evidence to the contrary (cf. "faith" in Eph. 4:5; Phil. 1:27; Col. 2:7).

<span id="page-363-3"></span>(4) The linguistic problem alleges that the vocabulary and style of the Pastorals is so different from Paul's language in the undisputed letters that the Pastorals could not have been written by him. P. N. Harrison, e.g., contends that the linguistic peculiarities of the Pastorals "are the work of one mind, and that mind, another than Paul's."15 Harrison contends further that the style reflects the language of the second century, not the first.16

The alleged linguistic problem is based on fairly unreliable criteria. I refer readers elsewhere for a fuller response to Harrison's work.17 Here it will suffice to say that there is nothing about the linguistic peculiarities of the Pastorals that cannot be explained by the ordinary observation that a single author is capable of a multitude of expressions. And sometimes the purpose and nature of the writing itself accounts for differences of style between discrete literary works from the same author. One will notice, e.g., a marked difference between a letter I might compose as a cover letter for a résumé and an e-mail that I may write to my wife. The Pastorals are, after all, the only letters in the Pauline corpus addressed to single individuals. Should we not expect some differences of vocabulary and style based on that fact alone?

The case against Pauline authorship is not as strong as some scholars suggest. In fact, the weight of the evidence remains in favor of the traditional view that Paul is the author of the letters to Timothy and Titus.

### *Date and Occasion*

The letters of 1 Timothy and Titus are occasioned by the fact that false teachers have found a foothold within the Ephesian and Cretan congregations. Paul writes to Timothy and Titus to exhort these pastors to oppose those false teachers with the apostolic gospel. This is why Paul is urgent in calling Timothy and Titus to identify qualified elders who will likewise oppose false teaching and join the work of shepherding the flock. In 2 Timothy, the fact that Rome is likely to execute Paul in the near term gives his words added impetus. Paul's words in 2 Timothy, therefore, have an urgent appeal for Timothy to stay faithful to preaching the Word after the apostle has died.

<span id="page-364-2"></span>As mentioned above, this commentary agrees with the view that Paul experiences a second Roman imprisonment not included in the book of Acts. After Paul is released from the imprisonment recorded at the end of Acts, he engages in further ministry, including trips to Ephesus and Crete (mentioned respectively in 1 Tim. 1:3 and Titus 1:5). Eventually, Paul is rearrested and placed in prison, from which he writes 2 Timothy while anticipating execution. The evidence suggests that Paul arrived in Rome the first time around AD 59–60. If we allow a few years for the first Roman imprisonment, then he would have been released around AD 62. That means that 1 Timothy and Titus would have been written sometime around the middle 60s.18 If we follow Eusebius's dating of Paul's martyrdom to AD 67, then Paul likely would have written 2 Timothy in AD 66 or 67. However, most modern scholars date his execution to AD 64 or 65, and so an earlier date is possible as well.19

### *Genre and Literary Features*

The letters to Timothy and Titus are clearly personal letters of the sort that were quite common in antiquity. Such letters, as seen in the NT, typically bore a fourfold format:

- *Salutation*: The salutation consists of a reference to the sender, a naming of the recipients, and a greeting (e.g., "grace and peace").
- *Thanksgiving* and/or *Prayer*: This section typically expresses thankfulness to God for the recipients.
- <span id="page-364-0"></span>• *Body*: This is the main part of an NT letter. Sometimes the body is divided between theological and ethical instruction (e.g., Rom. 1:18– 11:36 versus 12:1–15:33).
- <span id="page-364-1"></span>• *Conclusion*: The conclusion can include items such as a wish for peace, an expression of affection, a concluding autograph, a benediction, a doxol-

ogy, greetings to various individuals, greetings from those accompanying the sender, prayers, prayer requests, and news about travel plans.20

That the letters to Timothy and Titus exhibit all the hallmarks of a first-century letter is uncontroversial. What is controversial is whether these letters are pseudonymous, i.e., written in another person's name. If the Pastorals are pseudonymous, then Paul is not actually the author, and we can only speculate about who in fact is. Belief that the Pastorals are pseudonymous is the majority view among scholars today. I. Howard Marshall describes the scholarly landscape:

The reigning . . . hypothesis is that the letters were written much later than Paul by some unknown person who was using Paul's authority to say what he believed that the church of his day needed to know. He chose to use Paul's name and hide himself behind it because for him Paul was the only apostle and the source and foundation of the teaching which he believed that the church needed.21

Many of those who hold the Pastorals to be pseudonymous also believe that the author intended to deceive his readers into thinking that the letters derived genuinely from Paul. Bart Ehrman, e.g., argues that these letters are "forgeries." There were no copyright laws in the ancient world and no means of mass-producing literature. For that reason, some authors attached false names to their writings in order to "get a hearing for one's own views."22 Whatever the reason, most scholars believe that the practice of pseudonymity—however well-intentioned—involved the intent to deceive.

It is here that pseudonymity presents a moral contradiction to Christian notions of truth. It also raises an argument against these letters' being pseudonymous. Marshall explains:

This type of pseudonymity involves an intent to deceive the readers into the belief that it was the apostle himself who was writing. This conflicts with the fact that there was a high regard among early Christians and in the NT for truth and truthfulness. . . . People so motivated would have been unlikely knowingly to write or accept deceptive, pseudonymous works. The composition of Christian writings and the intent to deceive were not compatible. . . . Consequently, it can be argued on the basis of the early church's attitude to truth that the practice of deceptive pseudonymity in the first century by defenders of orthodox Christianity is extremely improbable.23

<sup>23</sup> Marshall, *Pastoral Epistles*, 83–84. Marshall himself does not believe that Paul wrote the Pastoral Epistles. Nevertheless, he finds the alleged acceptance of pseudonymity among early Christians to be morally and historically dubious. He therefore suggests an alternative approach, which he calls "allonymity."

All of the arguments in favor of the Pastorals' being pseudonymous rely in part on the idea that pseudonymity was a well-known and accepted literary convention of the day. But this claim is highly suspect. As Towner has shown, pseudonymity is "better attested in Intertestamental Judaism and in the Greco-Roman philosophical schools than in early Christianity."24 In fact, the evidence shows that where Christians recognized pseudonymity, they rejected it.

<span id="page-366-0"></span>The apostle Paul himself rejects pseudonymity by warning his readers not to be misled by a "letter seeming to be from us" (2 Thess. 2:2). The Muratorian Canon (2nd century) lists two books "forged under the name of Paul . . . and also several others which cannot be received into the Catholic Church, for it is not suitable for gall to be mingled with honey" (*Fragments of Caius*, in *ANF* 5:603). Serapion, Bishop of Antioch (2nd century), explains why he rejects the so-called *Gospel of Peter*: "We receive both Peter and the other Apostles of Christ; but as experienced men we reject the writings falsely inscribed with their names, since we know that we did not receive such from [our fathers]."25 Tertullian (3rd century) rejects "writings which wrongly go under Paul's name" and tells of a presbyter who was removed from office after confessing and being convicted of falsely writing a book in Paul's name (Tertullian, *On Baptism* 17, in *ANF* 3:677). Concerning the early Christian period, Donald Guthrie rightly concludes that "where the pseudonymous device was recognized it was not merely not tolerated but emphatically condemned."26 It is simply not plausible to contend that early Christians accepted pseudonymity either in the apostolic period or afterward.

### *Theology of the Pastoral Epistles*

### THEOLOGY OF 1 TIMOTHY

<span id="page-366-7"></span><span id="page-366-4"></span><span id="page-366-1"></span>Paul intends to confront the false teaching proliferating at Ephesus with the gospel of Jesus Christ. He intends for Timothy to lead this charge by opposing these false teachers directly and by appointing elders who will also contend for the faith (3:1–7). Paul says that the goal of such confrontation is to rekindle love in the hearts of the false teachers (1:5). Until they turn back from their error, they risk not only their own souls but also those of the whole congregation (1:19–20). Because of this, Paul tells Timothy that his ministry will be like "warfare" against the false teachers he must openly oppose (1:18). Paul says that he himself is the chief of sinners but has tasted the mercy of God in salvation through Christ (1:15). Paul intends for Timothy and the Ephesian Christians to pray for conditions conducive to others being able to hear the gospel message and experience that same mercy (2:1–7). For this reason, men and women need to behave in worship together in a way that brings credit to that message (2:8–15). And the church must present

Even though many apparent believers will apostatize (4:1–4), Paul says that Timothy must pay close attention to himself and to his teaching. Timothy's perseverance in this regard will culminate not only in his own eschatological salvation but also in the eschatological salvation of those to whom he is ministering (4:15–16).

On the contrary, Timothy must share in and embrace this same vocation of affliction for the sake of the gospel (1:8). Salvation is, after all, a benefit that comes to sinners by grace and not by works, according to the eternal plan of God through Christ Jesus (1:9–12). For this reason, Timothy must follow the pattern of sound words that Paul has taught him and must guard the gospel in the face of those who would oppose it (1:13–15). As a good soldier of Christ Jesus, Timothy must pass the gospel on to the next generation (2:1–7), because even though Paul is bound, the gospel is not bound (2:8–10). Therefore, Timothy's vocation is to be a faithful workman who handles rightly the word of truth (2:15). In order to avoid the unfaithfulness of false teachers (2:17–19), he must "flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness" (2:22–23), all the while seeking to persuade his opponents (2:24–26). Paul warns Timothy of godlessness in the last days (3:1–9) and of the necessity of holding fast to Scripture as God's Word (3:10–17). As Paul contemplates his forthcoming execution, he exhorts Timothy to preach the Word and to endure until the very end (4:1–8).

<span id="page-367-19"></span><span id="page-367-18"></span><span id="page-367-17"></span><span id="page-367-16"></span>Paul instructs Titus to appoint elders in the church who will be able to do two things: (1) "give instruction in sound doctrine" and (2) "rebuke those who contradict it" (1:5–9). These kinds of pastors must take their stand in the church because of the looming threat posed by false teachers (1:10–16). Titus is to instruct every age and gender group in the church to be faithful to sound doctrine (2:1–10), because the grace of God *must* transform the lives of those it touches (2:11–15). Paul instructs Titus and the congregants in Crete to cultivate healthy relationships with those outside the church and to realize that they too were once sinners on the outside (3:1–3). But because of the mercy of God in Christ, they have been brought near (3:4–7). Paul says that the good works of believers will be "profitable" for those outside the church, but their internal disputes will not be (3:8–9). That is why the "person who stirs up division" must be cast out if he does not repent (3:10–11).

### <span id="page-367-23"></span><span id="page-367-22"></span><span id="page-367-21"></span><span id="page-367-20"></span>*Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-367-1"></span><span id="page-367-0"></span>The Pastoral Epistles are like a capstone to the Pauline corpus. Elsewhere, Paul has explained in masterful detail how the gospel of Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of OT revelation (e.g., Rom. 1:1–7) and has taught that all of the old covenant promises are "Yes" and "Amen" in Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 1:20). Paul teaches that Gentiles who

<span id="page-368-3"></span><span id="page-368-2"></span><span id="page-368-1"></span>believe in Christ have been grafted into the rich root of Israel and now partake of the promised blessings to Abraham (Rom. 11:17). As a result, both Jews and Gentiles are now a part of one people of God—the church (Eph. 2:11–22). This church is built on a foundation consisting of the apostolic and prophetic messages, which derive from Jesus himself (Eph. 2:20). Paul's aim in the Pastorals is the continued maintenance of that apostolic foundation amid challenges from false teachers.

### *Preaching from the Pastoral Epistles*

Two recommendations can help those planning to teach on the Pastoral Epistles. The first is to preach these letters in order: verse-by-verse, line-by-line, word-byword. It is possible to construct a topical series from these books, but the structure of Paul's argument and meaning is often lost in such an approach. A topical approach may be fruitful in other sections of Scripture (e.g., the Proverbs), but a verse-by-verse exposition of the Pastorals will be the most fruitful way to bring forth the whole message and argument of Paul in these books.

<span id="page-368-5"></span><span id="page-368-4"></span><span id="page-368-0"></span>Second, even though these books are called the Pastoral Epistles, they are not intended only for pastors. When Paul wrote letters, he intended them to be read aloud to the entire congregation (the "you" is plural in 1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:22; Titus 3:15; cf. also 1 Thess. 5:27; Col. 4:16). This means that Paul intended his pastoral instructions to Timothy and Titus to benefit each of their respective congregations. These letters do not merely command pastors to be faithful in creed and in conduct for their own sake; rather, the pastors are supposed to be exemplary in this regard so that the entire congregation may walk in the same paths of faithfulness. Contemporary exhortations to Christian congregations must have the same focus.

### *Interpretive Challenges*

The question of pseudonymity is perhaps the most decisive interpretive watershed of the Pastoral Epistles. Those who view these works as pseudonymous tend to treat these letters as a distinct corpus, separate from the other Pauline letters. While there are many reasons that people adopt such a "corpus" approach to reading the Pastorals, Philip Towner highlights the downside to this method:

Their net effect in modern scholarship has been to isolate these letters from the other Pauline letters and consign them rather rigidly to their own corpus. Consequently . . . these three letters have struggled in recent times for a place in discussions about Pauline theology.27

Not every such approach to reading the Pastorals leads to a complete disjunction of the Pastorals from Pauline theology, but the ones that presuppose pseudonymity certainly do. It is commonplace among pseudonymous readings to view the Pastorals as a distinct and even contrary development of Pauline theology. Such

<sup>27</sup> Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 1.

readings observe a difference between the perspective of the authentic Paul in the undisputed letters and the pseudonymous "Paul" of the Pastorals.

<span id="page-369-2"></span><span id="page-369-1"></span>For example, Bart Ehrman argues that the authentic Paul expressed an egalitarian sensibility as seen in texts like Galatians 3:28: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Nevertheless, Paul's teaching retains a certain ambivalence, as he still urged the continuance of some social distinctions (e.g., 1 Cor. 11:3ff.). The pseudonymous "Paul," however, is alleged to reflect a later period in the history of the church in which the subordination of women was emphasized at the expense of Paul's more egalitarian themes.28 According to this point of view, the Pastorals reflect not Pauline theology but later developments. In this way, the Pastoral Epistles should be treated as a distinct corpus, not as in any way a reflection of authentic Pauline themes.

<span id="page-369-0"></span>This commentary takes a contrary point of view. As argued above, the case against pseudonymity and for Pauline authorship is compelling, and thus we must view these letters within the context of Paul's other writings. What Paul says in the Pastorals about gender issues, e.g., should inform what he has said elsewhere on the topic (e.g., Galatians and 1 Corinthians). And what Paul has said elsewhere on the topic should be taken into account when reading what Paul says on the same subject matter in the Pastorals. Tom Schreiner is correct: "Paul . . . wrote thirteen letters (in my view), and so we have a larger corpus from which to construct his thought."29 Whatever affinities there may be among the Pastorals that may justify calling them a "corpus," such affinities should not lead to a hermeneutical disjunction from the rest of Paul's letters. The thirteen canonical letters of Paul issue from a single author and offer complementary perspectives, not contradictory ones.

## <span id="page-374-0"></span>1 TIMOTHY 1:1–2

1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,

**<sup>2</sup>**To Timothy, my true child in the faith:

Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

### *Section Overview*

Verses 1–2 constitute the opening of Paul's letter to Timothy. Like other letters of its kind from the first century, 1 Timothy begins with a salutation consisting of three parts: (1) reference to the sender, (2) reference to the recipient, and (3) a greeting. Paul uses this form in all of his letters. He has put his own spin on this form and adapts it for his own Christian purposes. The two verses exhibit a structural symmetry, identifying "God" and "Christ Jesus" as the divine source of both Paul's apostleship and his salvific blessing ("grace, mercy, and peace"; see table 6.1).

### TABLE 6.1: Paul's Three-Part Salutation in 1 Timothy 1:1–2

| Sender    | Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of<br>Christ Jesus our hope, |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recipient | To Timothy, my true child in the faith:                                                        |
| Greeting  | Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.                         |

As is the case elsewhere in Paul's letters, the reference both to the sender and to the recipients includes material that is key to interpreting the rest of the book. Paul Christianizes a standard expression of greeting (*chairein*) by transforming it into "grace, mercy, and peace" (*charis*, *eleos*, and *eirēnē*).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-374-1"></span>1:1 The most contested word in the Pastoral Epistles may very well be the first that appears in each book—"Paul." Nevertheless, we take this reference to the sender of the letter to be authentic (cf. Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles). This is the same Paul who was introduced as the church-persecuting Pharisee in the book of Acts.

<span id="page-375-11"></span><span id="page-375-10"></span><span id="page-375-4"></span><span id="page-375-2"></span>Paul calls himself an "apostle of Christ Jesus." Even though the word translated as *apostle* can be used with the generic sense of *messenger* or *delegate* (e.g., John 13:16; 2 Cor. 8:23; Phil. 2:25), it certainly means more than that here. *Apostle* refers to a foundational office in the church (Eph. 2:20). It is the term the Gospels give to the special group of disciples sent out by Jesus to proclaim his message. The term refers specifically to the twelve whom Jesus appointed to preach the gospel of the kingdom (e.g., Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:14; Luke 6:13). In the Upper Room Discourse of John's Gospel, after Judas has already left to betray Jesus, Jesus tells these men of his plans for them after his departure. He promises to send the Holy Spirit to teach them, to bring to their minds everything Jesus has taught them, and to guide them into all truth (John 14:26; 16:13). In other words, Jesus promises a special divine enablement for these men to be the authoritative representatives of Jesus' teaching and God's truth.

<span id="page-375-7"></span><span id="page-375-6"></span><span id="page-375-5"></span><span id="page-375-3"></span>After Jesus' ascension, the apostles seek to fill the position vacated by the betrayer Judas. In doing so, the apostles lay down two primary qualifications for anyone who might fill the twelfth slot as apostle: (1) he must have been an eyewitness of Jesus' resurrection, and (2) he must have been commissioned by Jesus himself to preach the gospel (Acts 1:21: "one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us"; cf. Luke 10:1). In Acts 1:26, they ultimately choose Matthias to become the new twelfth apostle. But later in Acts, Jesus himself reappears and commissions Saul of Tarsus. On his way to persecute Christians in Damascus, Saul becomes an eyewitness of the resurrected Christ (Acts 9:3–4) and is later commissioned by Jesus to be a "chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel" (Acts 9:15). Thus Jesus himself appoints Paul to the apostolic office. This is why Paul calls himself an "apostle of Christ Jesus" in 1 Timothy 1:1. He is an authoritative messenger of the gospel and has been commissioned by Christ Jesus himself.

<span id="page-375-9"></span><span id="page-375-8"></span><span id="page-375-1"></span><span id="page-375-0"></span>Notice that Paul uses the term "Christ" in connection with Jesus. This is not accidental or without meaning. Christ translates the Greek term *christos*, which in the Septuagint is the Greek translation of the Hebrew term for "anointed one," or Messiah—the long-anticipated Davidic king who would come and take his place as ruler and Savior of the world (cf. LXX 2 Sam. 19:22; 22:51; 23:1; Pss. 2:2; 17:51; 131:17; Dan. 9:25–26). Paul employs *Christ* as a royal title, indicating that all of the messianic expectation of the OT has been fulfilled in this man Jesus. Paul's phrase "Christ Jesus," therefore, is the virtual equivalent of "King Jesus." And it is this man—King Jesus, the rightful sovereign of the world—who has sent Paul forth as an apostle. To be an "apostle of Christ Jesus" is to be on a mission with a message bearing the authority of Jesus himself.

Paul says that he became an apostle of Christ Jesus "by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope." This is Paul's way of making clear that Jesus' appointment is a divine one. The term translated "God" is *theos*, which is Paul's characteristic term for referring to the first person of the Trinity. Indeed, in the very next verse he explicitly calls him "God the Father." Paul's language here is obviously pre-Nicene, but it is also thoroughly Trinitarian—at least insofar as it implies something profound about the first two persons of the Godhead. God the Father and Christ Jesus are distinct personalities, yet their "command" of Paul's apostleship is singular. There is no daylight between Jesus' will and his Father's will. Indeed, they share the very same divine will. This is not a Nicene formulation, but the substance of that later development is here. And Paul makes clear that his apostleship derives its origin in the purposes of God himself. There can be no stronger statement of Paul's authority as an apostle.

<span id="page-376-0"></span>"God our Savior" harks back to OT descriptions of God as the Savior of Israel and of his anointed King (e.g., LXX 1 Sam. 10:19; Ps. 24:5). It is a reminder that the saving purposes of God in the OT have now been brought to their apex in the saving work of Christ. "Christ Jesus our hope" reminds Christians that they look to Christ alone as the guarantor of their final salvation—the resurrection of the body. In Paul's writings, "hope" is not merely wishful thinking (as in, "I hope someone gives me a million dollars"). Paul uses "hope" to refer to a confident expectation that God will fulfill his word in due time (e.g., Rom. 8:24–25). By marking Christ as the substance of hope, Paul shows that the destiny of the believer is bound inexorably to Jesus. Paul also ties the certainty of our resurrection to the certainty of Jesus' own resurrection, which has been attested by many witnesses, including Paul (1 Cor. 15:3–8).

<span id="page-376-5"></span><span id="page-376-3"></span><span id="page-376-2"></span>1:2 Paul addresses this letter to Timothy, his "true child in the faith." A "true" child is "one who is considered a valid member of a family" (BDAG, s.v. γνήσιος). "Child in the faith" indicates that Paul's fatherly bond is not a blood relation but a spiritual one. Nevertheless, Paul does not view his familial relation to Timothy as a legal or spiritual fiction but as a genuine bond—one perhaps even more profound than a blood relation.

<span id="page-376-1"></span>Luke introduces Timothy in Acts 16:1 as the son of a Jewish woman and a Gentile father. Timothy proved himself to be a faithful servant of Christ as he traveled with and was mentored by Paul. His relationship with Paul became very close, which is why Paul calls him "my legitimate/true son." Paul did not lead Timothy to faith, but Paul was his spiritual father in the sense that he showed him the ropes of gospel ministry. Timothy went with Paul all over the Roman world, assisting him and preaching the gospel, and eventually Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to lead the church there.

<span id="page-376-6"></span><span id="page-376-4"></span>The greetings in 1 and 2 Timothy are identical: "Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord." The source of grace, mercy, and peace in verse 2 is the same as the source of Paul's apostleship in verse 1—"God" and "Christ Jesus." In verse 2, however, the Trinitarian dimensions are accentuated. It is both "God the Father" and "Christ Jesus our Lord" who provide these spiritual blessings. "Father" expresses the first person of the Trinity's unique relation to <span id="page-377-0"></span>the Son, which itself is reflected in the messianic expectation of the OT—that the Messiah would be the son of God (e.g., 2 Sam. 7:14).

### *Response*

<span id="page-377-3"></span><span id="page-377-1"></span>Paul's authority as an apostle does not apply to Timothy alone (or even merely to the Ephesian congregation). As an apostle, Paul is Christ's spokesman. Thus his words have all the authority of Jesus and must be heeded by faithful Christians. Readers of this letter must approach it with hearts open to receive and live by the truth of God as delivered by Paul.

### 1 TIMOTHY 1:3–7

**<sup>3</sup>**As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, **4**nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship*<sup>1</sup>* from God that is by faith. **<sup>5</sup>**The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. **6**Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion, **7**desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.

Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to shepherd the congregation there, and it is clear that Timothy is facing a challenge. False teachers have infiltrated the church, and Paul has given Timothy the specific commission to stand them down.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-377-2"></span>1:3 The beginning of this verse locates Paul's remarks historically. As indicated in the Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles, Paul wrote 1 Timothy after the events recorded in the book of Acts. Paul instructed Timothy to remain in Ephesus for

pastoral reasons. There were "certain persons"—probably within the church—who had begun to teach "different doctrine" to God's people. Some translations render the phrase as "false doctrine," but this does not quite capture the meaning. The teaching was indeed false, but its falseness consisted in its being "different"—not in the sense of being weird but in the sense of being a departure from a norm. But from what norm does the false teaching depart?

<span id="page-378-5"></span>This question is answered explicitly in 6:3, where Paul uses the same word (*heterodidaskalei* ). Paul defines "different doctrine" as that which departs from "the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ" and from "the teaching that accords with godliness." In other words, "different doctrine" contradicts Jesus' own teaching as preserved in the apostolic tradition.

<span id="page-378-2"></span><span id="page-378-1"></span>The fundamental characteristic of this false teaching is that it does not agree with the "sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ." This phrase indicates that Paul believes his gospel to come from Jesus (cf. Gal. 1:11–12). Because he is an apostle, Paul understands his teaching as Christ speaking through him (2 Cor. 13:3). Thus "sound" teaching refers to those words that conform to the standard of Christ's words, which Christ himself commissioned Paul to speak (Acts 9:15; 26:16). So, when Paul speaks as an apostle, he is speaking the very words of the Spirit of Christ. To teach "different doctrine" means to teach that which does not agree with the authoritative apostolic standard.

<span id="page-378-6"></span><span id="page-378-3"></span><span id="page-378-0"></span>1:4 Verse 4 continues the prohibition of verse 3. Timothy must command "certain persons" (v. 3) not to give attention to "myths and endless genealogies." The term "myth" indicates a fictional story as in a tale, story, or legend (BDAG, s.v. μῦθος). We are not sure what stories may be in view here, but we know that they are not grounded in Scripture or the apostles' teaching (cf. "Jewish myths"; Titus 1:14). George W. Knight writes that a myth is an "unreal tale that only the gullible believe and follow, which produces nothing of value."1 Thus a myth is plainly contrary to what the church has received.

BDAG notes that "genealogies" has been understood in one of two ways. It has sometimes been interpreted as a reference to Gnostic teachings. Another interpretation—going back as far as Ambrosiaster and Jerome—posits that the background is Jewish and involves rabbinical speculation on biblical genealogies. Here too it is difficult to know which interpretation is correct. If the aforementioned "myths" are Jewish in nature, then perhaps rabbinical speculation is in view here as well. That these false teachers desire to teach the law (1 Tim. 1:7) also suggests that their error has Jewish roots. Both the myths and the genealogies are "endless" in the sense that they are "tiresome" (BDAG, s.v. ἀπέραντος).

<span id="page-378-4"></span>Whatever the source of the "myths and endless genealogies," we know that they do not derive from a true understanding of Scripture or the apostle's teaching. These fables do not rally God's people in unity around the truth. Rather, they

<sup>1</sup> George W. Knight III, *The Pastoral Epistles: A Commentary on the Greek Text*, NIGTC (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992), 73.

distract God's people from the "stewardship from God that is by faith." The term translated "stewardship" could also be rendered "administration" or "plan." God has a plan of salvation that he is administering through Christ on behalf of sinners. The administration of that plan happens *by faith*. The myths and genealogies, therefore, distract from God's plan of salvation.

<span id="page-379-2"></span><span id="page-379-1"></span>1:5 "The aim of our charge" connects back to the "charge" of verse 3: "*charge* certain persons not to teach any different doctrine." The "charge" in both verses means *command*. Timothy is to command people not to teach error (v. 3). The goal of this command is love (v. 5). The "aim of our charge" does not address the goal of Paul's teaching in general but relates specifically to the false teachers Timothy must address. Yes, Paul wants Timothy to protect the flock, but he also wants the false teachers to be corrected—to produce "love" in the hearts of these errant teachers. But not just any love; Paul desires it to be a love that grows out of some very specific motives. He desires the love to grow out of a "pure heart," a "good conscience," and a "sincere faith." A pure heart is one that has been washed by the Spirit. A good conscience is one that walks in the deeds of the Spirit. A sincere faith is one that relies on Jesus alone for salvation.

<span id="page-379-3"></span>1:6 Verses 6 and 7 describe false teachers who persist in their error. Paul warns that "certain persons, by swerving from these [i.e., a pure heart, good conscience, sincere faith], have wandered away." In other words, false teaching grows out of hearts that are impure, consciences that are not good, and faith that is insincere. False teaching, therefore, is not merely a failure of the mind; it is a failure of the heart. And when the heart swerves *from* the truth, it veers *into* "vain discussion" disputes and speculations that have no good purpose or outcome.

<span id="page-379-4"></span>1:7 Paul notes that false teachers aim to teach "the law," i.e., the OT law of Moses. This verse must be understood in connection to the fascination with "myths and endless genealogies" in verse 4. The false teachers are reading the law, but they do not understand it correctly. This is why their teaching is a perversion of God's Word rather than a faithful exposition of it. Perhaps they have been drawn into fictional stories about biblical characters and speculations about the genealogical lists in Moses' writings. Whatever the reason for their misinterpretation, the point is that false teachers often use the Bible. In fact, a large part of the appeal of false teaching is that it uses biblical rhetoric to promote unbiblical error. But when false teachers use the Bible this way, they do not really know what they are talking about. They may have confidence, but they do not have the truth.

### *Response*

<span id="page-379-0"></span>The authority that Paul claims extends to all of the apostles. Jesus promised to send the apostles the Spirit to lead them into all truth and to bring to their remembrance everything Jesus taught them (John 14:26; 16:13). Thus the apostolic teaching would become the standard for discerning truth from error: "We are from <span id="page-380-2"></span><span id="page-380-0"></span>God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error" (1 John 4:6). If we want to know Christ's words, then we have to listen to the apostles' words. When Paul wrote 1 Timothy, this standard existed mainly in oral form. But now we have the apostolic word inscripturated for us in a book. For us, "different doctrine" is anything that disagrees with or contradicts what is written in the Bible.

<span id="page-380-1"></span>It has well been said that "all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." We have to be willing to face down false teaching and error wherever they spring up. But we must address the issues in the hope that God may grant repentance to false teachers. Do we hold out hope that those who teach error might repent? Do we pray for them? Do we admonish them?

### 1 TIMOTHY 1:8–11

**8**Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, **9**understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, **<sup>10</sup>** the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers,*<sup>1</sup>* liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound*<sup>2</sup>* doctrine, **<sup>11</sup>** in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.

### *Section Overview*

In verses 3–7, Paul has instructed Timothy to stand against the false teachers threatening the flock. Their false teaching is based on the Bible, but as they read the Mosaic law, they are fixating on "myths" and "genealogies." As a result, they do not find their way to the apostolic gospel but wander into error. This raises a question: If the false teachers are reading the law and are still contradicting the gospel, then is the law the problem? Paul labors to show that this is not the case. It is those who distort the law who are the problem. The law itself is good, for it exposes the ungodly and is in accordance with the gospel.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-381-6"></span><span id="page-381-2"></span><span id="page-381-0"></span>1:8 The use of the first-person plural ("we know") is Paul's way of declaring that his view of the Mosaic law is the "recognized Christian understanding of the subject, one that is commonly known, believed, and accepted"2 (cf. Rom. 2:2; 3:19; 8:22, 28; 1 Cor. 8:1, 4; 2 Cor. 5:1; 1 John 3:2, 14; 5:18, 19, 20). Christians know and agree that the law itself is good, even though it can be distorted through false teaching. Several observations with broader hermeneutical implications can be made about Paul's statement.

<span id="page-381-5"></span>First, Paul is referring to the reading of Scripture. Paul's reference to the "law" is not an appeal to some vague moral law. His earlier references to "myths" and "genealogies" invoke narrative portions of Mosaic law (1 Tim. 1:4), so he clearly has *all* of Moses' writings in view (Genesis through Deuteronomy), not merely the portions containing commands and prohibitions.

<span id="page-381-7"></span><span id="page-381-1"></span>Second, Paul is contrasting valid and invalid reading strategies. The problem is not with Scripture. Paul views the law as "breathed out by God" (2 Tim. 3:16). He believes Moses' law to be "holy and righteous and good" (Rom. 7:12). But the fact that Scripture is good and holy does not mean that all interpretations of Scripture are good and holy. Some are good, while some are bad. Paul and the apostles read the law "lawfully"; the false teachers do not.

Third, Paul says that the "law" must be used "lawfully." Here the apostle is distinguishing appropriate from inappropriate forms of interpretation. The proper way to read the text is implied by the nature of the text itself; one must use the law *lawfully*. Proper interpretation, therefore, must be guided by properties that inhere within the text. The key property is its inspiration (2 Tim. 3:16), which is why Paul says that the law is "good."

Fourth, the inspiration of Scripture puts a focus on the author's intention. As I. Howard Marshall has observed, Paul has a "concern to use it as law (i.e. as it is meant to be used) rather than as a source of speculative thinking."3 To use the law *lawfully*, then, is to read it as it was meant to be read. Meant by whom? Meant by God as he influenced the human authors of Scripture. Paul says elsewhere that the Holy Spirit ensures the total truthfulness of the author's intent (1 Cor. 7:25; 2 Cor. 13:3; cf. 2 Pet. 1:21) and of the writings that convey that intent (2 Tim. 3:16). The aim of reading Scripture is to know what God's men said through the texts they wrote. That is what it means to "use the law lawfully."

<span id="page-381-4"></span><span id="page-381-3"></span>Fifth, Paul seems to draw a line between reader speculation and textual meaning. Paul describes the reading strategy of the false teachers as "speculation" a hermeneutic that focuses on the misguided conjectures of the reader. So there is a bright contrast between the text itself—which Paul describes as inherently "good"—and the errors that readers read into the text. This ought to give us pause about strategies that assign to the reader's response the same authority as the author's intent.

<sup>2</sup> Ibid., 80.

<sup>3</sup> Marshall, *Pastoral Epistles*, 376.

To conclude, using the law lawfully means reading it in a way that would be agreeable to the human author (Moses) and, ultimately, to God himself.

<span id="page-382-5"></span><span id="page-382-4"></span>1:9 "Understanding" should be understood causally. Thus the argument between verses 8 and 9 could be summarized in this way: "Because he understands that the law is for lawless people, he uses it lawfully." In other words, the only person who uses the law lawfully is the one who understands that the law was meant not for righteous persons but for sinners. The law is to instruct ungodly people; it is there to show sinners how to differentiate between good and evil.

Up to this point Paul has been referring to the Mosaic law in its entirety, but in verses 9–10 he focuses on the Ten Commandments in particular. The vice list that follows tracks closely with the commands Moses received from God in Exodus 20 (table 6.2). It seems, therefore, that the items in Paul's list intend to name specific violations of the Ten Commandments.

<span id="page-382-6"></span>TABLE 6.2: 1 Timothy 1:9–10a and the Ten Commandments

"For the lawless and disobedient": A "lawless" person is one who violates God's moral standards. A "disobedient" person is one who refuses to submit to God's authority. Together these may be construed as a violation of the first commandment: "You shall have no other gods before me" (Ex. 20:3).

<span id="page-382-3"></span><span id="page-382-1"></span>"For the ungodly and sinners": The combination of these two terms appears elsewhere in Scripture (cf. Ps. 1:1, 5; Rom. 5:6, 8). The term translated "ungodly" can describe "idolatrous behavior."4 Taken together, therefore, these terms may be read as general terms for transgression against the second commandment: "You shall not make for yourself a carved image" (Ex. 20:4).

<span id="page-382-2"></span><sup>4</sup> Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 126n18.

<span id="page-383-0"></span>"For the unholy and profane": Perhaps the "unholy" are those who do not "hallow" God's name. And so the third commandment is aimed at them: "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain" (Ex. 20:7). The "profane" may refer to those whose lives are marked by worldliness and commonness, those who do not know how to keep the fourth commandment to "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Ex. 20:8).

<span id="page-383-4"></span><span id="page-383-1"></span>"Those who strike their fathers and mothers": The two Greek terms behind this phrase appear only here in the NT. The standard lexicon of NT Greek defines these terms as referring to those who murder their father and those who murder their mother (BDAG, s.v. πατρολῴας and μητρολῴας). But Paul's use of the terms here may be connected to Exodus 21:15, which suggests that patricide and matricide are not in view. Rather, the terms refer to those who "smite" their parents.5 In any case, these transgressors violate the fifth commandment, which requires one to "Honor your father and your mother" (Ex. 20:12).

<span id="page-383-2"></span>"Murderers": Even though Paul could have used the more common term for "murderers" ( *phoneusin*), here he uses the less common "man-killers" (*androphonois*, which appears only here and in *2 Macc.* 9:28 in all of the LXX and NT). The use of "man-killers" could be stylistic6 or may be an intentional delineation of the meaning of the sixth commandment.7 In either case, the term refers to someone who violates the sixth commandment, "You shall not murder" (Ex. 20:13).

<span id="page-383-3"></span>1:10 "The sexually immoral" and "men who practice homosexuality" both fall under the broad category of sinful sexual behavior, which is addressed in the seventh commandment, "You shall not commit adultery" (Ex. 20:14).

<span id="page-383-5"></span>"The sexually immoral" translates the Greek term *pornos*, "one who practices sexual immorality, *fornicator*" (BDAG, italics original). In Pauline usage, sexual immorality ( *porneia*) is defined as "unlawful sexual intercourse" (BDAG). Paul defines "unlawful" by the norms of the Mosaic law, which forbids premarital sex, adultery, homosexual relations, incest, bestiality, and more (Lev. 18:6–23). In short, "sexual immorality" is any sexual activity that takes place outside the covenant of marriage. Anyone who engages in sexual activity outside that covenant would be considered a *pornos*, and the next phrase specifies one type of "sexually immoral" person.

<span id="page-383-6"></span>"Men who practice homosexuality": This phrase translates a single Greek word, *arsenokoitais*. It is very difficult to render this Greek term with a single English equivalent. The term appears nowhere else in Greek literature before Paul's use of it in 1 Corinthians 6:9 (its only other appearance in the NT). Some scholars have argued that the term refers not to homosexual sex per se but to exploitative same-sex relations such as pederasty or male prostitution. This point of view is unlikely for a couple of reasons.

First, the word is a compound of *arsēn* ("male") and *koitē* ("bed"), and the literal sense would be "one who *beds* a *male*." The "male" part of this compound is not

<sup>5</sup> Marshall, *Pastoral Epistles*, 85.

<sup>6</sup> William D. Mounce, *Pastoral Epistles*, WBC (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2016), 38.

<sup>7</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 85.

a term that refers to young boys or male prostitutes only; it is a term for male human beings in general. Going to bed with a "male," therefore, would include all same-sex sexual activity and would not be limited to exploitative forms such as pederasty. This interpretation is based on the etymology of the term, which is what scholars often resort to when there are no previous uses of a term with which to compare it. Of course, etymology alone does not always tell the whole story of a word's meaning. In this case, however, the word's connection to the OT confirms what its etymology implies.

<span id="page-384-1"></span>Second, even though Paul has coined a term for same-sex sexual immorality, he most likely derives this term from the Greek version of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13:

"And you shall not lie in bed (*koitēn*) with a male (*arsenos*) as with a woman, for it is an abomination." (Lev. 18:22 AT)

<span id="page-384-2"></span>"And whoever lies with a male (*arsenos*) in bed (*koitēn*) as with a woman, both of them have done an abomination; let them die, they are guilty." (Lev. 20:13 AT)

<span id="page-384-4"></span><span id="page-384-3"></span><span id="page-384-0"></span>It is not difficult to see how Paul's term *arsenokoitais* appears to be a combination of the underlined terms from Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. This observation is supported by the fact that Paul alludes to Leviticus 18 in defining incest in 1 Corinthians 5, and that he again draws from Leviticus 18 in his use of *arsenokoitēs* in 1 Corinthians 6:9. Both Leviticus and subsequent Jewish tradition forbid *all* samesex sexual activity, not merely that which is exploitative. Paul is confirming that the sexual norms of Leviticus 18 still define sexual norms for Christians. And that means that it is against the law of Christ to engage in same-sex sexual activity.

<span id="page-384-5"></span>The only question that remains is how to translate *arsenokoitais* in 1 Timothy 1:10. The NASB and the CSB render it as "homosexuals," but this is misleading. The term "homosexual" implies notions of identity and orientation that are not specifically included in *arsenokoitais*. The ESV and other modern translations are correct to clarify the focus on *behavior*: "men who practice homosexuality" (ESV); "those practicing homosexuality" (NIV); "people . . . who practice homosexuality" (NLT); "people who have intercourse with the same sex" (CEB). Still, the ESV's rendering is best because it brings out the fact that *male* homosexual activity is in view here.

"Enslavers": The term translated "enslavers" (*andrapodistais*) appears only once in biblical Greek. This term is also a compound, bringing together the terms "man" (*anēr*) and "bind/tie feet" ( *podizō*). The term refers to someone who forcibly and coercively binds/ties the feet of men. An etymological rendering might be "manbinder." The King James Version comes close to this rendering with "menstealers." In actual usage, however, the term refers specifically to someone involved in slave trading, "one who acquires pers. for use by others, *slave-dealer, kidnapper*" (BDAG, s.v. ἀνδραποδιστής, italics original). The term reflects the fact that kidnapping and slave trading were closely related in the first century. This is why many translations render the term as either "kidnapper" (e.g., CSB, NASB, NET) or a variation

<span id="page-385-0"></span>on "slave trader" (e.g., NIV, NLT, NRSV). The ESV's rendering brings together both ideas with "enslavers." In any case, an "enslaver" violates the eighth command, which forbids taking something that is not one's own: "You shall not steal" (Ex. 20:15). Since kidnapping could lead to slavery, there may also be an allusion to the tenth commandment, which forbids coveting a neighbor's "male servant or female servant" (Ex. 20:17).

<span id="page-385-2"></span>"Liars, perjurers": "Liars" are those who intentionally deceive others with their words. "Perjurers" are those who lie under oath. Both kinds of persons obviously violate the ninth commandment, which declares, "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor" (Ex. 20:16).

<span id="page-385-5"></span><span id="page-385-1"></span>The law applies not only to the aforementioned sinners but also to those who practice "whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine." The word translated "sound" refers to that which brings "health and life" (cf. 1 Tim. 1:10 ESV mg.). In other words, there is a kind of teaching that brings life and health to people, and there is a kind of teaching that does not. The proper use of the law will highlight by contrast that which makes people spiritually sick. Paul will define "sound doctrine" as that which is consistent with the gospel and the apostles' teaching (v. 11). Anything that contradicts the gospel as preached by the apostles would by definition be unsound. It is important that Paul ends the list with this catch-all statement. There is much more to God's moral demands than what has been enumerated in the preceding list. The tenth commandment functions in a similar way at the end of the Ten Commandments: it shows that it is not merely the *doing* of sin that is the problem. The *desiring* of sin is equally a problem. Thus the demands of God's moral law are much more expansive than one might imagine by focusing myopically on a list of commands. Such lists are crucial, but there is more. This is what the tenth commandment indicates, and Paul's final phrase does the same.

<span id="page-385-6"></span>1:11 As mentioned previously, verse 11 defines "sound" teaching as that which conforms to the "gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted." Sound teaching is, therefore, the apostolic deposit of faith. The heart of that faith is the truth that Jesus Christ was crucified to pay for his people's sins and was raised to give them eternal life. The kind of teaching that brings life and health is that which is in accord with this message.

### *Response*

<span id="page-385-4"></span><span id="page-385-3"></span>Do we agree with Paul that the law is good? Do we agree with him that all of Scripture is good? Or do we find ourselves resenting God's law and rejecting his word at precisely those points at which his Word confronts our lives? One way to combat this temptation to take some time to read and meditate on Psalm 119, which shows us what it is like for someone to be transfixed by God's Word. We must ask God to make the prayers of Psalm 119 our prayers. We must think and feel about God's Word the same way Jesus did—that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4).

### *Section Overview*

The apostle Paul never ceased to be amazed at how the Lord Jesus had worked in his life. Paul never saw himself as a likely candidate to be a Christian, much less an apostle. Nevertheless, the Lord made him both, and Paul spent the rest of his days making much of the grace that had transformed his life. He was a man gripped with a passion and a joy that would have been difficult for many to understand. Still, Paul never tired of proclaiming the grace of Christ, and so he never stopped worshiping. This is what is transpiring in 1 Timothy 1:12–17, which is merely a peek into Paul's absolute exultation over the grace of God that he had experienced. Paul has penned for us what ought to be the experience of every Christian—the joy and rapture of a heart made free.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-386-0"></span>1:12 "I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord" is the banner waving over the rest of this passage. It is an expression of worship, directed explicitly to Christ. When Paul says that Christ "has given me strength," he is referring not to the ongoing power of God in sanctification but to what God gave him at his conversion and call to ministry. Fundamentally, God "strengthened" him in the sense that he gave him gifts and ability for mission. Paul is astonished by this mercy and grace because he was previously an enemy of the faith.

<span id="page-387-3"></span><span id="page-387-2"></span>1:13 A "blasphemer" is one who uses his words to defame, denigrate, or demean another (BDAG, s.v. βλάσφημος). A "persecutor" is one who harasses and mistreats another, especially because of that person's beliefs (cf. BDAG on *diōktēs* and *diōkō*). The Greek term translated as "insolent opponent" is used only one other time in the NT (Rom. 1:30), but its verb form appears numerous times in the NT and refers clearly to someone who mistreats another person in ways that often include physical violence (cf. Matt. 22:6; Luke 18:32; Acts 14:5; 1 Thess. 2:2). Paul was an enemy of Christ, and yet Christ chose him to be an apostle. This truth was a marvel to Paul. Paul knew that Jesus did not treat him as his sins deserved. And so Paul worships because of God's mercy toward him.

<span id="page-387-1"></span><span id="page-387-0"></span>Paul recognizes, "I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief." Paul's ignorance does not imply that he was thereby innocent—as if he did not know any better. Paul means what Jesus meant when he prayed from the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). The men crucifying Jesus did not understand the full implications of what they were doing. Nevertheless, they were still guilty and in need of forgiveness. God holds sinners accountable even if they do not comprehend the full implications of their sin. It is the same here with Paul. It seems that Paul views both his ignorance and his unbelief as inculpatory. That he had acted in ignorance seems to be proof that he needed mercy, just as the unbelief proves that he needed mercy. Paul needed mercy because he was locked into ignorance and unbelief. And, because of God's great mercy, Christ freed him from both.

<span id="page-387-4"></span>1:14 Verse 14 makes clear that Paul's thankfulness and worship is a response to "grace." This term describes what God has done for his people, not what his people do for him. Paul says that God's grace overflowed with faith and love. In other words, before coming to Christ, Paul lacked faith and love. But, because of grace, the faith and love that find their source in Christ Jesus overflowed to him. The persecutor and violent aggressor became the one who loves the Lord Jesus and his people. And all of this came to him from grace.

<span id="page-387-5"></span>1:15 "The saying is trustworthy" translates the Greek phrase *pistos ho logos* (lit., "faithful is the word"). This phrase appears five times in the Pastoral Epistles but nowhere else in the NT (1 Tim. 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; 2 Tim. 2:11; Titus 3:8). Two times the formula includes an added element—"and deserving of full acceptance" (1 Tim. 1:15; 4:9). Towner argues that the meaning of the phrase is defined by its function.8 According to some interpreters, the phrase functions to accentuate the truthfulness of the words to which it is connected. Others understand the phrase as a marker of

<sup>8</sup> Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 143–145

a quotation from accepted apostolic tradition. The phrase most likely functions in both ways.9 As Knight argues, "The phrase is a citation-emphasis formula which serves to draw one's attention to the fact that a saying is cited and which serves at the same time to emphasize and commend that saying."10

<span id="page-388-5"></span>The "trustworthy" *logos* refers not to a generic "word" but to the gospel message handed down faithfully by the apostles. In fact, a similar phrase is used in Titus 1:9, where elders are described as those who "hold firm to the trustworthy word." It is faithful in the sense of being trustworthy.

<span id="page-388-2"></span>This phrase ("the saying is trustworthy") introduces a well-known "faithful statement" of the gospel: "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." "Christ" is Jesus' kingly title, and the saying announces the purpose of his ministry, death, and resurrection: he came to rescue sinners, to deliver them from sin's power and punishment. This particular saying emphasizes that Christ aims to save *sinners*—the very kinds of people who are named as lawbreakers in verses 10–11: the "lawless and disobedient," the "ungodly and sinners," the "unholy and profane," "those who strike their fathers and mothers," the "murderers," the "sexually immoral," the "men who practice homosexuality," the "enslavers," the "liars," and the "perjurers." Jesus drew near to such "sinners" during his earthly ministry precisely because it was his aim to save the likes of them (e.g., Matt. 9:10–13; Mark 2:15–17).

<span id="page-388-3"></span><span id="page-388-0"></span>That Jesus came to save such "sinners" makes the final clause of the verse all the more remarkable. In reference to such sinners, Paul declares himself to be the "foremost." After surveying a bad lot of "sinners," Paul says that *he* is the worst of the lot. Presumably, Paul sees the sins of his own pre-Christian life (1 Tim. 1:13) as the most infamous and prominent. In other words, Paul's own sin and God's lavish grace come together to humble Paul. He does not view himself as more spiritually qualified than the lawbreakers of verse 10. He looks at those sinners and at himself and reflects, "I am the worst." There is no moral superiority in Paul. There is only humility, gratitude, and wonder because of the grace of God.

<span id="page-388-4"></span><span id="page-388-1"></span>1:16 "For this reason" introduces the purpose of God's mercy in Paul's life. Paul views his own conversion as a part of God's plan to save other sinners. Paul's humility here is profound. Because he is convinced that his sin is worse than everyone else's, his attitude is expectant: "If God can save me, he can save anybody!" In fact, he says this is precisely why God saved him: so that he might be a living, breathing example of Christ's perfect patience toward sinners; and so that others would be encouraged by knowing that, if God's grace is big enough for Paul, then it must be big enough for everyone else as well. Paul is convinced that the mercy of God has come to him for a purpose—to prove the sufficiency of God's mercy through Christ for all sinners. Other sinners would come to "believe in [Christ] for eternal life" because they had seen the same transformation in Paul.

<sup>10</sup> George W. Knight III, *The Faithful Sayings in the Pastoral Letters* (Kampen: J. H. Kok, 1968), 1.

<span id="page-389-2"></span>1:17 Paul erupts with praise in view of God's mercy. His worship begins with the one to whom the praise is addressed: "To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God." Paul declares that to this God alone belong "honor and glory forever and ever." "Honor" refers to the esteem and reverence that are due to God because of who he is. "Glory" refers to all of who God is, as it is put on display. Those who *glorify* God in this sense are those who magnify all that God has revealed himself to be through Christ. And Paul's doxological wish is for such honor and glory to be ascribed to God for all eternity. "Amen" often concludes such doxologies (cf. Rom. 1:25; 11:36; 16:27) and expresses Paul's confirmation of the truthfulness of what has just been stated.11

### <span id="page-389-0"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-389-1"></span>Paul views himself as the worst of all sinners. Even though Paul was a professional law keeper and had a very robust conscience before his conversion (Phil. 3:4–6), and even with other lawbreakers in view (homosexuals, fornicators, etc.), Paul is unambiguous that he feels his own sin to be the worst. Paul's humility about his own sin and need for grace should inform our own consciences. There is a lesson here for every sinner who has been saved by God's grace in Christ. It does not matter whether any of us truly is the worst of sinners; we ought to feel, in our own hearts, as though we are. In other words, we should feel the weight and ignominy of our own sin as more prominent than the sins of others. It should be a constant item of wonder and astonishment that God would send his son to die for our sin. We ought to be so amazed and astonished that God would condescend to save us. This should not make us morose and depressed. It should make us humble, grateful, and worshipful.

### *Section Overview*

In these three short verses, Paul reiterates his "charge" to Timothy. This charge is a command to resist false teachers. Such resistance is necessary for any faithful pastoral ministry. Those who fall away from "faith" and a "good conscience" will

<sup>11</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 106.

make a "shipwreck" of their faith. When they do (as Hymenaeus and Alexander have done), the church must act to discipline them.

		- 2. Pastoral Discipline of False Teaching (1:20)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-390-1"></span>1:18 "This charge" refers to the charge Paul gave in verses 3 and 5: "Charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine. . . . The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith." Thus Paul has entrusted Timothy with the responsibility to confront false teachers. Paul says that he put Timothy in Ephesus to command these false teachers to cease and desist. Paul does this "in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you." In the early church, a call to ministry sometimes came by means of prophecy. For example, in Acts 13:1–4 the Holy Spirit speaks through prophecy to set apart Barnabas and Saul for missionary work. Likewise, Timothy has been set apart for pastoral ministry, and Paul is reminding him that confronting false teachers is a part of that calling. Failure to confront false teaching is failure to be a faithful pastor.

<span id="page-390-0"></span>The final clause of the verse expresses the purpose for which Paul has entrusted Timothy with this charge: "that by them you may wage the good warfare." The word translated "wage" (*strateuē*) means "to engage in a conflict" (BDAG). Not all conflict is bad—Paul says that this is "good warfare." This conflict is a fight worth having because that which the pastor contends for is so precious: human souls. Contending against false teachers is not a necessary evil but a necessary good. The charge is singular, but the prophecies are plural. This indicates that "by them" refers to the prophecies that were an encouragement for waging the good warfare.

<span id="page-390-2"></span>1:19 How does a pastor keep up this fight? Verse 19 answers, "[By] holding faith and a good conscience." "Holding" indicates that possessing "faith" and a "good conscience" is the means by which the battle must be waged. The only way in which Timothy will stay ready for the fight is by persevering in faith and a good conscience—which means that he must trust in Christ ("faith") and obey his word ("good conscience"). Paul says there are "some" people who have strayed from a good conscience. As a result, they have "made shipwreck of their faith"—they have apostatized from following Christ.

<span id="page-390-3"></span>1:20 Paul names two men in particular who have fallen away: Hymenaeus and Alexander. These two men have succumbed to the danger against which Paul is warning: they have shipwrecked their faith. We do not possess an explicit description of what these two men did to shipwreck their faith, but elsewhere Paul may <span id="page-391-4"></span><span id="page-391-3"></span>have given some hints. In 2 Timothy 2:17–18, Paul says that Hymenaeus taught that the resurrection had already occurred and by doing so had upset the faith of some in the congregation. In 2 Timothy 4:14–15, Paul says that Alexander the coppersmith did him "great harm" and "strongly opposed" his message. Even if we do not know the specifics, it is probably safe to conclude that both of these men were false teachers.

<span id="page-391-2"></span>According to verse 19, these men fell away from "faith" and a "good conscience." In other words, they failed both to believe and to do the right thing; their apostasy was rooted in a failure of heart and of character.

<span id="page-391-1"></span><span id="page-391-0"></span>And now, because they have fallen away, Paul says that he has "handed [them] over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme" (v. 20). Paul's instruction mirrors his language describing church discipline in 1 Corinthians 5:5: "You are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord." In 1 Corinthians Paul says that the church must hand an unrepentant so-called brother over to Satan because of continued sexual immorality. Paul tells the Corinthian congregation to ostracize the offender and not even to eat with him (1 Cor. 5:9, 11). In other words, "handing over to Satan" is Paul's language for excommunication—Paul has set Hymenaeus and Alexander outside of the church and back into the realm of Satan and his influence. Why? In order to teach them not to "blaspheme"—to instruct them to stop slandering and defaming God with their false teachings. As stated above, the goal of Paul's discipline is love—that they might repent and be restored. But as long as they refuse to repent, they must be set outside the church.

### *Response*

When it comes to sin in the body of Christ, preaching against sin is necessary. But if we ever get to the point at which we are content with preaching against error while not removing it, then eventually the error will metastasize and kill the congregation.

John Owen famously said, "Be killing sin, or it will be killing you." If that statement applies to individuals, it applies as well to congregations. This does not mean that we need to be trigger-happy with church discipline and excommunication. Rather, we must be forbearing with one another, understanding that personal ongoing repentance is the normal way that we kill sin within the body. Each of us has the ongoing obligation to turn from sin anew every day of our lives.

### *Section Overview*

"Then" connects verses 1–7 to the previous paragraph, which addresses the need to confront false teachers. Paul is thus declaring that, in light of the necessity of confronting false teachers, Timothy and the church in Ephesus must pray for all kinds of people, for two reasons. First, they must pray so that the church can live in peace. Second, they must pray so that sinners might come to the knowledge of the truth about Jesus' atoning death.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-392-1"></span>2:1 Paul urges Timothy to lead the church to pray "first of all"—Paul wishes to give this exhortation first because of its great importance.

<span id="page-392-0"></span>The word "then" simply means "therefore" and resumes the thought begun in 1:18: "Because I am entrusting you with the pastoral duty to oppose false teachers (1:18), you *therefore* need to pray (2:1)." Thus Paul views prayer as one of the ways in which the church combats false teaching.

Paul mentions four different types of prayers: supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. He probably does not intend to give a precise delineation of different types of prayer but rather means simply to say that the church needs to offer all kinds of prayers for all people, and the type of prayer required will often be dictated by the need of the moment.

<span id="page-393-4"></span>Paul tells Timothy not only that the congregation needs to pray; he also tells him for whom they should pray: "for all people." Included in the "all people" would be those spreading error within the church. For them, the church ought to pray that God might grant them repentance (2 Tim. 2:25). But they must also pray for "all people," which probably means all *kinds* of people, in light of the delineation that follows in verse 2.12

<span id="page-393-1"></span>2:2 Paul specifies one type of people for whom he wants Timothy and his congregation to pray: "kings and all who are in high positions." This phrase refers to the governing authorities in their Roman imperial context. "Kings" can include the emperors but may also refer to Roman client kings.13 Paul directs Christians to pray for these rulers because kings and governors are empowered to enact laws and policies that either protect Christians or make them a target for unjust treatment. We must pray so "that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way."

The term translated "peaceful" means quiet and tranquil, "untroubled from without."14 Thus such prayer would ask for governing authorities to conduct themselves in a way that keeps Christian churches safe from mistreatment—the kind of suffering and persecution that tempts believers to be unfaithful to Christ. This peace and quiet is not an ultimate end but a penultimate one. The ultimate end is that the church might live "godly and dignified in every way." *Godliness* describes the "awesome respect" that every person owes to God (BDAG, s.v. εὐσέβεια). *Dignity* "connotes moral earnestness, affecting outward demeanor as well as interior intention."15 Thus *godliness* may indicate the Godward, reverential perspective while *dignity* represents the manward, ethical perspective. The former has in view the duty to honor God, while the latter focuses on the duty to honor God before one's neighbor.

<span id="page-393-2"></span>2:3 Prayer that pleads with God for a peaceful and quiet life is "good" and "pleasing" to God. The term translated "good" indicates that such prayer is morally praiseworthy. God commends such prayer in part because it is a prayer for God's moral standards to be upheld—that is, for his people not to be mistreated but to be allowed to carry out obedience to him without interference. Likewise, such prayer is "pleasing" in the sense that it is "welcome" (BDAG, s.v. ἀπόδεκτος). God welcomes prayers for his people to be treated with equity and justice.

<span id="page-393-3"></span><span id="page-393-0"></span>2:4 Verses 1–3 said that prayers for "all people" were good and pleasing in the sight of "God our Savior." That last phrase is the connection to verse 4. God is a Savior "who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth." God's people are not merely praying for God to give them a peaceful and quiet life.

#### 1 Timothy 2:1–7 394

They are not merely praying for their own personal piety. They are praying that all people might experience salvation through Christ.

Universalism teaches that God saves everyone, and here is a verse that says in no uncertain terms that God's will is for "all" to be saved. So, is this text stating that everyone is saved, whether they want to be or not?

The short answer is no. Neither this verse nor any other teaches that all people will be saved regardless of whether they have faith in Christ. What does it mean, then, for God to desire, or will, that all people be saved? And what does this verse mean in light of the fact that, in the end, not all *will* be saved?

Some interpreters hold that even though God wants something to happen, he does not necessarily make it happen. He gives people free will to decide whether to pursue his will for them. So there is contingency in God's plan for the world. His will is contingent on the free will of sinners. Even though this is a widely held view, it is most likely not what Paul means to say in this text.

The key to understanding this text is to see that the Bible speaks of God's will/ desire in two different ways. On the one hand, God has a providential will that cannot be violated. On the other hand, he has a moral will that *can* be violated.16

<span id="page-394-2"></span><span id="page-394-1"></span>God's *providential* will refers to his sovereign plan for the world and for all of our lives. When Paul says that God "works all things according to the counsel of his will" (Eph. 1:11), he is referring to God's providential will that cannot be broken. This is also what Paul is referring to in Romans 8:28: "For those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose." In this sense, we cannot know what God wills until it happens. It is not revealed in the Bible; it unfolds in history. His providential will is largely a secret to us. We can know it only in retrospect.

God's *moral* will refers to his holiness and goodness. His moral will is reflected in his commands: "You shall not murder." "You shall not steal." "Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect." These commands express God's moral will, and human beings *can* defy God's moral will. In fact, this is what sin is: defiance of God's will as revealed in Scripture. When Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, "This is the will of God, your sanctification," he is referring to God's moral will. And people break that all the time.

<span id="page-394-3"></span><span id="page-394-0"></span>Thus Scripture can refer to God's will in one of two ways, depending on the context. This is why Isaiah is able to prophesy about Jesus' death, "It was the will of the Lord to crush him" (Isa. 53:10). Does this mean that it pleased God for Roman soldiers to kill Jesus? No, of course not. In doing so, they were sinning. They were defying God's moral will. So, in what sense was it "God's will" that Jesus should be killed? It was God's providential will and plan that his Son should die for sinners.

So, when Paul writes in 1 Timothy 2:4 that God "desires" or wills for all people to be saved, to what is he referring: God's providential will, or his moral will? He is referring to God's moral purpose that all men everywhere should repent and be

<sup>16</sup> See the appendix titled "Are There Two Wills in God? Divine Election and God's Desire for All to Be Saved" in John Piper, *The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God* (Sisters, OR: Multnomah, 2000), 313–340.

saved. Yes, it is God's moral will that all be saved, but it is not his providential will that all be saved. Salvation will come only to "all people" who believe.

So, then, what is Paul's point in saying that it is God's will for "all" to be saved? God has given his people the gospel to take to all nations. God's will for every person on the planet is for him or her to repent and believe in the gospel. Some, by grace, will respond. And some will not respond. God's people cannot know in advance who is going to respond to this message and who is not. God's people are to pray and to preach to everyone concerning God's will for them—that they should repent, believe, and be saved. The results of that witness are left to God.

<span id="page-395-4"></span>2:5 God desires all people to be saved, and these verses explain that there is only one way for them to be saved. There is only one God, and this means there is only one plan of salvation: his plan. God has appointed his Son, Jesus, to be a "mediator" between himself and sinners. Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead in order to heal the breach between a holy God and sinful man. In this way, "the man Christ Jesus" effects reconciliation between God and mankind.

<span id="page-395-6"></span><span id="page-395-2"></span><span id="page-395-1"></span><span id="page-395-0"></span>2:6 "Who gave himself" means that no one took Jesus' life away from him (John 10:18). On the contrary, Jesus offered himself freely on the cross as a "ransom" meaning that he died in the place of sinners to pay the price owed by them for their sins.17 This statement is likely a variation on Jesus' own words concerning his death as a ransom (Mark 10:45; cf. Matt. 20:28). The ransom price was the penalty of death (cf. Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23). Sin deserves judgment, and Jesus took that judgment upon himself when he died on the cross. By his death, he provides forgiveness of sins. By his resurrection, he offers eternal life. He is a ransom "for all." This ransom, however, is effective only for those who believe in Christ. Nevertheless, the giving of himself "for all" is a "testimony given at the proper time." The "testimony" in view here most likely refers to testimony that serves as proof (BDAG, s.v. μαρτύριον), such as in a court of law. No doubt God is the one giving this testimony; in some sense Christ's ransoming work is God's proof that Christ has given himself on behalf of sinners.

<span id="page-395-7"></span><span id="page-395-5"></span>2:7 Paul's calling to preach the gospel (outlined in vv. 5–6) is by divine appointment: "For this I was appointed." God appointed Paul to be a "preacher" (a herald of the gospel message) and an "apostle" (one specifically commissioned by the risen Christ for the work). Paul says that Christ made him a "teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth." This is reminiscent of Jesus' own words concerning Paul's ministry (Acts 9:15). He preaches "in faith and truth," which indicates fidelity to the gospel and its truthfulness as God's revelation.

Christians should pray that their governing authorities would provide for them a peaceful and quiet life, free from mistreatment by those on the outside. Our

brothers and sisters around the world who are being persecuted are crying out to God for deliverance, and we must pray for their deliverance as well. Thus we must pray for kings and all in authority to stop persecuting such believers and to stop allowing others to persecute them. We must pray for their freedom to live a peaceful and quiet life, freedom to lead a life of godliness and holiness. And we must pray the same for ourselves. We must pray against any external power or force that would coerce us to betray Christ. The Lord Jesus himself taught us to pray this way, as he prayed: "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil" (Matt. 6:13).

### *Section Overview*

Our passage appears amid a longer section in which Paul instructs Timothy concerning how the congregation ought to pray. In short, Paul has commanded them to pray for "kings" and "all who are in authority" because he desires God's people to be able to lead a peaceful and quiet life. Ultimately Paul desires to preserve conditions conducive to evangelism and holiness. Now, in verses 8–15, Paul describes to Timothy how men and women in particular are to conduct themselves within the church. This is, after all, the main reason Paul writes the letter: to communicate to Timothy how people are supposed to conduct themselves "in the household of God, which is the church of the living God" (1 Tim. 3:15). In this text, he is particularly concerned with how men and women behave when they gather together for public worship.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-397-5"></span>2:8 It is significant that Paul addresses men in verse 8 before addressing women in verse 9. Paul views men as leaders of their homes—and some of them as leaders of the church. He is making clear that they have a particular role to play "in every place" where the church gathers, including at Ephesus. Men are supposed to pray. Paul has already made clear what he wants them to pray for (cf. 2:1–7). The issue that he focuses on here is *how* they are supposed to pray, zeroing in on two things, one positive and one negative.

<span id="page-397-3"></span><span id="page-397-2"></span><span id="page-397-0"></span>On the positive side, they are to pray while "lifting holy hands." This is a common posture for prayer in the OT (1 Kings 8:22; Pss. 28:2; 63:4). Jesus himself prayed with lifted hands (Luke 24:50). A reference in Isaiah to the lifting of the hands informs our understanding of Paul's words in 1 Timothy 2:8:

<span id="page-397-4"></span>When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil. (Isa. 1:15–16)

<span id="page-397-1"></span>Isaiah is clear that lifting hands is not merely a posture for prayer. A person's hands represent his deeds, which can be either pure or defiled. In the Isaiah text, his hearers' "hands" are covered with blood, so God will not hear them.

This is why Paul calls on these men to pray while lifting "holy hands." Their public expressions of worship must flow from a life marked by holiness. In other words, God is looking for worshipers who will worship him in spirit and in truth, not in hypocrisy. God cares very little for a man's religious performance at worship if such a man is living like the Devil elsewhere. And so Paul says that men are to raise "holy hands."

Negatively, Paul asserts that public expressions of worship must grow out of a life that is without "anger" or "quarreling." Anger and quarreling, therefore, are the specific sins in view that render a man's "hands" unholy. "Anger" refers to an inner disposition of wrath and indignation, while "quarreling" refers to unholy disputes and arguments produced by such an angry spirit. "Lifting holy hands" requires a transformation of both heart and deeds.

<span id="page-397-6"></span>2:9–10 "Likewise" indicates a correspondence between Paul's exhortation to men in verse 8 and his exhortation to women in verse 9. George Knight explains the connection this way: "Just as Christian men needed to be warned that their interest in vigor and discussion should not produce strife and dissension (v. 8), so Christian women needed to be warned that their interest in beauty and adornment should not produce immodesty and indiscretion."18

<sup>18</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 136.

There is nothing new under the sun. Women in Paul's day were concerned about their appearance just as some women in our day are. There is evidence from antiquity that these particular adornments—elaborate braiding of hair, gold, pearls, expensive clothing—while not evil in themselves, could be marks of sinful motives: "It is the excess and sensuality that the items connote that Paul forbids (cf. Jas. 5:1–6), not braids, gold, pearls, or even costly garments in and of themselves."19 It is not that all braids and gold and pearls and clothing were wrong. It is only those that express seduction or ostentation (cf. 1 Pet. 3:3–4, where Peter is not forbidding wearing "clothing" per se).

<span id="page-398-7"></span><span id="page-398-6"></span><span id="page-398-3"></span>2:11 Learning was not generally encouraged for women by Jewish men in the first century, yet, in spite of that patriarchal norm, Paul tells the believers in Ephesus that he desires women to "learn" (i.e., to be instructed in the faith). This command for women to "learn" is the only imperative in this entire text. However, the accent is not on the command itself (Paul seems to assume that women will be learning) but on the manner in which women are to do so: literally, they are to learn "quietly" and "with all submissiveness."

<span id="page-398-2"></span><span id="page-398-0"></span>"Quietly" does not mean that women are never to utter a word when the church gathers for worship. This would completely contradict what Paul says about women in 1 Corinthians 11, where he tells the women how to pray and prophesy in church. His assumption is that they will pray and prophesy, which means his assumption is that they will speak during church services. We may note that the term for "quietly" in verse 11 is similar to the term for "quiet" in verse 2. When Christians are commanded to pray for a "peaceful and quiet life," that phrase does not describe a life in which no one talks. It aims rather at a life "without turmoil" (cf. BDAG, s.v. ἡσυχία). Likewise here, "quietly" does not mean complete silence. It means instead that women are to be "without turmoil." The term requires women to have a "quiet demeanor and spirit that is peaceable instead of argumentative."20

<span id="page-398-1"></span>Second, women are to learn "with all submissiveness." This expression is related to the expression Paul uses in Ephesians 5 in instructing wives to submit to their husbands. But here in 1 Timothy he is not narrowly talking about submission to a husband but is addressing submission to the proper teaching authorities in the church—the elders. He is instructing the women not to be contentious and usurp the role of the elders but to submit to their authority. In this sense, the Christian woman's obligation is no different from that of a Christian man. Both men and women are called to submit to the authorities God has placed in the church (e.g., Heb. 13:17). Submitting to the authority of the elders is not unique to women. What is unique about a woman's role is articulated in verse 12.

<span id="page-398-5"></span><span id="page-398-4"></span>2:12 This verse is one of the most controversial texts in all of the NT, mainly because there is such a difference of opinion over what it is that Paul is disallow-

ing. The literature on this verse is voluminous, and adjudicating all the competing interpretations would be beyond the scope of this commentary.21 Nevertheless, we can simplify the discussion by dividing interpretive options into two groups.

One stream of interpretation posits that Paul is prohibiting one thing—a certain kind of teaching. On this view, such interpreters translate the statement as "I do not allow a woman to teach with authority," or perhaps, "I do not allow a woman to teach with an intent to dominate." In either case it is only a certain kind of teaching that Paul prohibits. As long as women do not teach with authority teaching with pastoral authority—then it is permissible for women to teach men in the gathered assembly of the church. Or, as long as female teachers do not seek to dominate, they are allowed to teach the gathered assembly of God's people. Paul rules out for women not church-wide teaching per se but only a certain kind of teaching—the kind that wrongly assumes authority or exercises authority in a harsh or sinful way.

But neither of those interpretations makes sense of the actual wording of the text. Thus another stream of interpretation holds that Paul is prohibiting *two* things, not one.22 On this view, Paul is saying that women should not teach *or* exercise authority within the gathered assembly of the church. Paul is disallowing both activities. Paul is not prohibiting *all* teaching by women—as if a woman must refrain from teaching subjects like geometry or science. The word translated as "teach" refers specifically to teaching Christian doctrine. Thus the prohibition applies narrowly to those who would teach and preach the Bible.

Nor is Paul saying that women are incapable of being gifted Bible teachers. There are many women who are very gifted teachers. He is simply saying that the exercise of their teaching gifts must be kept within certain parameters. They are not allowed to teach men. Nor are they allowed to "exercise authority," which means that women are not to be pastors.23 As the following chapter of 1 Timothy makes clear, the pastorate is reserved only for qualified men—not all men, but only those who meet certain qualifications, with the result that they are recognized as elders by the rest of the church.

The average person with modern sensibilities begins to feel an objection welling up: "Why would Paul put gender parameters on who can teach and be an elder? This sounds sexist." As if he were anticipating this objection, Paul answers it in the next verse.

<span id="page-399-1"></span><span id="page-399-0"></span>2:13–14 The word "for" introduces the reason for the prohibition in verse 12: "For Adam was formed first, then Eve." This is a clear reference to the Genesis 2 account

<span id="page-400-0"></span>of creation. In Genesis 2, God creates Adam from the ground and afterward creates Eve from Adam's rib. Paul is teaching that the reason for the prohibition has something to do with how God made the first man and the first woman.

<span id="page-400-4"></span>Some interpreters have suggested that the first woman had an intellect and discernment inferior to the man's. They argue, therefore, that women are prohibited from teaching because they are not quite "up to snuff" intellectually. Such an interpretation is unpersuasive, for various reasons. First of all, Paul calls for women to teach other women (Titus 2:3–5). If women are intellectually inferior to men, then Paul would not have let them teach at all. But because Paul wants women to teach other women in the church, he obviously believes that at least some women are fully capable of doing so. Second, the text does not say that women are prohibited from teaching because they are more gullible than men. Notice in verse 13 that Paul uses the word "first" to emphasize the sequence of the creation of the man and the woman: "Adam was formed first, then Eve." This means that the reason for the prohibition of verse 12 is found in the order of creation.

<span id="page-400-3"></span><span id="page-400-2"></span><span id="page-400-1"></span>Note too that verses 13 and 14 use passive verbs: "Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived." The implicit agents are God in verse 13 and Satan in verse 14. In this way Paul highlights not what Adam and Eve did in the garden but what was done *to* them. Verse 13 specifies that God made Adam *first* and then Eve. In contrast, verse 14 specifies that Satan first deceived Eve, not Adam. In the original order of creation, God spoke his word to Adam, Adam spoke God's word to Eve, and Adam and Eve were to rule over the beasts of the ground. In the fall, the Serpent spoke his word to Eve, Eve influenced Adam to follow her, and both Adam and Eve evaded God. So verse 13 tells us what God has done, and verse 14 tells us what Satan has done. God established an order of creation, and Satan subverted that order (table 6.3).

TABLE 6.3: Agency and Order in Creation and the Fall

Paul appeals to this agency and order in creation and the fall to show that Adam's leadership in the first marriage was established in part on the basis that God created him first — a principle of primogeniture very common in the ancient world. Because this ordering is a part of God's original creation and is deemed by God to be "good," Paul views it as the paradigm for all marriages to follow. God intends a certain order in the husband-wife relationship. The order of creation establishes the husband as leader in the first marriage and in all marriages to follow.

<span id="page-401-3"></span><span id="page-401-1"></span>The order in marriage has wider implications for church leadership, which is the point Paul is pressing in 1 Timothy 2:12ff. Paul appeals to the nature of marriage to establish a point about leadership within the church. This is not an accident, and it corresponds with what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11:3–16 concerning marriage, "headship," and order within the gathered assembly. The pattern for leadership in marriage is the basis for an all-male eldership. The gender norms of the eldership must follow the gender norms for marriage. If this were not the case, the church's leadership structure would be at odds with the leadership structure God has established for marriages within the church.

Sin came into the world when the Serpent strove to assault God's order. Likewise, to subvert the headship principle that God established at the very beginning would be to subvert God's design. This is why he prohibits women from teaching and exercising authority within the gathered assembly. The prohibition is not because of deficiency of intellect among women. Nor is it due to some situation specific to the Ephesian church. Because this prohibition is rooted in the order of creation, it is a transcultural principle to be observed for all times and ages. Male headship in marriage is not a result of the fall but is a part of the order of creation. So also, then, is male eldership in the church.

<span id="page-401-4"></span>2:15 The interpretation of verse 15 has also been an item of great debate among commentators. The confusion over the meaning of this verse is reflected in different English translations. For example, the NASB says that "women will be preserved," whereas the ESV says that "she will be saved." The NASB reflects the view that Paul is merely stating that faithful Christian women will be preserved physically when they give birth. But this is implausible, because we know that not all faithful Christian women survive childbirth. The ESV is nearer the mark. This particular Greek word always refers to spiritual salvation elsewhere in the Pastoral Epistles, and we have no reason to think the verb is being used differently here.

<span id="page-401-2"></span>If this is the case, is Paul suggesting that women are saved by means of bearing children? This would seem to contradict Paul's teaching that salvation is by grace through faith apart from works (e.g., Eph. 2:8). One ancient interpretation of this text avoids this question by holding that this statement refers not to childbirth generically but to *the* childbirth of the Messiah Jesus. This interpretation harks back to Genesis 3:15, which says that the seed of the woman will crush the head of the Serpent, a prophecy fulfilled ultimately in the birth of Christ, who destroys the works of the Devil. Thus, women are saved through the childbirth of Christ. But that interpretation makes little sense in context.

<span id="page-401-0"></span>It is more likely that Paul uses childbearing as a figure of speech known as a synecdoche.24 A synecdoche is a figure in which the part stands for the whole. Childbearing is a part of a larger whole, which is the woman's wider role to care for the home. This is the same role Paul describes in Titus 2:4–5: "Young women [are] to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at

home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled."

<span id="page-402-0"></span>So, in both 1 Timothy 2 and Titus 2, Paul declares that wives have a Godordained role to play in caring for children and the home. This is not claiming that a woman must have children in order to be saved. It is not even teaching that a woman must be married to be saved. But for those women who are married, God assigns a special responsibility to care for the home.

A wife's fulfillment of this role will be one of the evidences of perseverance in the faith. Salvation is future in this verse: "She will be saved." Thus it is not entry into salvation that is in view but the future consummation of salvation. Women who embrace their God-ordained role while continuing in the Christian virtues of "faith and love and holiness, with self-control" will find themselves saved on the last day (cf. comment on Titus 2:5 concerning "working at home").

### <span id="page-402-1"></span>*Response*

Female readers might consider whether their assumptions about discipleship line up with Paul's. It would be unbiblical and unhealthy to assume that careful Bible study and theology are the exclusive preserve of men. This is not what Paul teaches. When Christian women gather together with the church, they are there to be instructed and discipled in the Word, just as men are. All people must be students of the deep things of God.

God has so ordered the church that its teaching authority resides with the pastors (elders). The congregation recognizes and puts forth qualified men for this position. And women are called to learn in quietness and submission within this order.

God has a reason for ordering the offices of the church in the way that he does. And Satan hates that reason. God intends the all-male eldership to reflect the principle of male headship established at creation. God intends male headship in marriage to portray Christ's loving headship over his bride the church. That means that the principle of headship is not an imposition on God's people. It symbolizes both to God's people and to the world the unsurpassed beauty of Christ's saving work.

### *Section Overview*

The main bulwark against false teaching in a church is leaders who contend faithfully for the faith. Paul refers to such leaders as "overseers" (Gk. *episkopos*, sometimes translated "bishop"). Paul instructs Timothy concerning the qualifications for overseers. He says they must be mature in their faith and must have exemplary character and family life. In addition, they must be able to teach the faith. All of these characteristics together describe the qualifications for faithful pastoral ministry.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-403-3"></span><span id="page-403-1"></span><span id="page-403-0"></span>3:1 "The saying is trustworthy" (cf. comment on 1:15) refers most likely to the words that follow. Thus the "trustworthy saying" concerns those who wish to be an "overseer" in the church. "Office of overseer" translates a single term, *episkopēs*. According to BDAG, *episkopēs* accents the task of an *episkopos* (mentioned in verse 2 and translated "overseer"), that of "engagement in oversight, *supervision*" (italics original). This term came to be used as a reference to the office of one who leads the church. Anyone who aspires to such an office desires something "noble" and good.

Some translations, such as the KJV, render *episkopēs* as "office of a bishop." Many readers understand "bishop" to suggest a hierarchy in the church's leadership. Roman Catholics, for instance, believe the bishop to be higher in office than, and with authority over, the elder. Close attention to this and related terms reveals the mistake of taking this term to refer to an office that exercises authority over the elders of the church. This is so mainly because Paul and the other NT authors use *overseer* interchangeably with the word for *elder*. For example, consider Titus 1:5–7:

<span id="page-404-6"></span><span id="page-404-5"></span>This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint *elders* in every town as I directed you. . . . An *overseer*, as God's steward, must be above reproach. (Titus 1:5, 7)

<span id="page-404-4"></span>Clearly, *elder* and *overseer* are used interchangeably here. Likewise, in 1 Timothy 5:17, Paul uses the term *elder* where readers might expect him to say *overseer*. In doing so, Paul reveals that *overseer* and *elder* are two ways of referring to the same office.

<span id="page-404-7"></span><span id="page-404-2"></span>Paul is not the only NT author who speaks in this way. In 1 Peter 5:1–2 the apostle exhorts "elders" to "shepherd" the church by "exercising oversight" (*episkopeō*, the verb form of the term translated "overseer"). Peter also draws on a third concept—*shepherd* ( *poimainō*), the verb form of the noun for "pastor" ( *poimēn*; cf. Eph. 4:11). In two verses, Peter draws together three different word-groups in reference to the one office of church leadership: *overseer*, *pastor*, and *elder*. Peter is reflecting what is true in all of the NT: the authors of Scripture use these three terms to refer to the one office.

<span id="page-404-1"></span>Another text confirms the interchangeability of these terms. In Paul's final meeting with the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:17–38), Luke writes that Paul gathers together the "elders," calls them "overseers," and exhorts them to "care for" (lit., "shepherd") the church in Ephesus (Acts 20:17, 28). Thus Luke also utilizes all three word-groups in this one chapter to refer to one office.

<span id="page-404-0"></span>Thus when Paul affirms that the man who aspires to the office of overseer desires a good thing, he is referring to the one office of leadership within the church: *pastor*/*elder*/*overseer*.

<span id="page-404-3"></span>3:2 Paul declares that an "overseer must be above reproach," which indicates an "external personal reputation that would be a credit to the church."25 Many commentators agree that this first qualification is a general statement about good character, with the rest of this list specifying that which being "above reproach" entails. Thus the focus of the list is not on gifting but on character. One's gifting is certainly a consideration ("able to teach"), but it is not the whole, or even the main thing, that Paul is looking for in an overseer.

The first qualification is that a man must be the "husband of one wife." There are at least four different views on what Paul means by "husband of one wife":

(1) Some think this simply means that elders must be married, but this interpretation is unlikely because Paul also says that an elder must have submissive children (v. 4), but certainly infertility would not disqualify a man from the eldership. Rather, *if* an elder has children, they must be subject to his authority. Likewise, the sense here is that *if* an elder has a wife, he must be faithful to her. Further, it would be wrong to interpret this phrase in a way that would disqualify both Paul and Jesus from serving as a pastor, since both were unmarried. This interpretation is therefore unlikely.

(2) Others believe Paul is declaring that an overseer must not be a polygamist. However, even though there were polygamists in the first century among the Jews, the practice was against Roman law. In addition, monogamy was the norm for both Jews and Greeks in Asia at that time.26 Paul probably did not mean to address something that was not an issue for his audience. Further, the phrase "wife of one husband" appears in 5:9, but no one holds that Paul is referring polygamy in that passage. All of this adds up to the conclusion that Paul is not talking about polygamy here in 3:2 either.

(3) Still others believe that this qualification requires an overseer to have only one wife during his entire life; such a reading would exclude divorced men and widowers from ever becoming pastors, but this view is unlikely as well. Divorce is relevant to the question of a man's fitness for ministry—the time and circumstances of any divorce must figure in to any evaluation of a person for pastoral ministry. But this is probably not the issue Paul wishes to address with this phrase. Paul says elsewhere that it is permissible for widows and widowers to remarry if they are so inclined (1 Cor. 7:9), and he encourages young widows to remarry (1 Tim. 5:14). However, this does not preclude their being "the wife of one husband" (as he phrases it in 5:9). So "husband of one wife" does not mean "a man who has been married only one time."

<span id="page-405-2"></span><span id="page-405-1"></span><span id="page-405-0"></span>(4) A final group of commentators believes Paul to be teaching that an overseer must be faithful to his wife; the text literally says that the pastor must be a "man of one woman" (cf. ESV mg.). The elder must be faithful to his wife in a monogamous relationship. To be a "one-woman man" prohibits promiscuity and homosexuality. An elder must have a clear and consistent pattern of honor, love, and devotion to his wife alone.27

The next qualifying mark is that an elder must be "sober-minded." A pastor must not be a drunkard but must be clear-minded and have good judgment.

In addition, elders are to be "self-controlled." The Greek term is *sōphrona*, meaning "being in control of oneself, *prudent, thoughtful*" (BDAG, italics original). This refers to one who is controlled not by his passions, lusts, or idolatries but by the Spirit. The term can have the nuance of sexual decency as well.28

<span id="page-406-7"></span><span id="page-406-1"></span>

The qualification of being "respectable" denotes "qualities that evoke admiration or delight" (BDAG, s.v. κόσμιος). These qualities are able to produce such an effect because they refer to a "person's outward deportment."29

That an elder is to be "hospitable" means that an overseer's home is open to care for the needs of others. It is not closed off to those who need material help.

<span id="page-406-5"></span>The adjective translated "able to teach" appears only one other time in the Greek NT (2 Tim. 2:24). In both instances it describes someone skilled in teaching Christian doctrine (BDAG, s.v. διδακτικός). A similar expression in Titus 1:9 specifies what this skill looks like in practice:30 it involves the ability "to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it" (Titus 1:9). Likewise, the term's meaning is defined further in 2 Timothy 2:25, where skill in teaching involves "correcting [one's] opponents with gentleness." The ability to teach, therefore, requires not only faithful instruction in apostolic doctrine but also faithful confrontation of false doctrine.

<span id="page-406-6"></span><span id="page-406-2"></span>3:3 An elder is to be "not a drunkard," which means not "given to drinking too much wine" (BDAG, s.v. πάροινος). The descriptor in verse 2, "self-controlled," is what must be pursued; "not a drunkard" describes what must be avoided. A man cannot be controlled by the Spirit while inebriated.

Paul further says that elders are to be "not violent." "Violent" describes a man who likes to brawl.31 Anyone known for bullying or abuse, therefore, would not be eligible for the pastorate.

Elders are to be "gentle," which means "not insisting on every right of letter of law or custom, *yielding, gentle, kind, courteous, tolerant* " (BDAG, s.v. ἐπιεικής, italics original); that is, "gracious, forbearing."32 This is not a person who winks at or celebrates sin. Rather, such a man is clear-headed about sin and righteousness but nevertheless does not appear judgmental or pharisaical.

The expression "not quarrelsome" literally means to be "without battle," describing a person who is "disinclined to fight, peaceful" and "not contentious" (LSJ, s.v. ἀμαχος).

<span id="page-406-4"></span><span id="page-406-0"></span>An elder must also be "not a lover of money," standing in contrast to those "in the last days" who are "lovers of money" (2 Tim. 3:1–2; cf. Luke 16:14). In that sense, those who love money stand condemned because "the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils," not the least of which is falling away from the faith (1 Tim. 6:10). This is why love of money cannot reign in the heart of an overseer.

<span id="page-406-3"></span>3:4 "He must manage his own household well" means that the overseer must look well after the ways of his own household. A pastor must have an exemplary home. This does not mean that everything is always perfect or even that all of his children necessarily are believing Christians. Rather, a faithful pastor will be one

who leads his home and who disciplines his children diligently, and that attention to discipline will be reflected in some degree in his children's behavior: "with all dignity keeping his children submissive." Unruly children often reveal a lack of loving discipline and managerial order in a home. If those elements are absent, the buck stops with the head of the household. He is the one who must lead the charge to make sure that righteousness exists in the home. An overseer must be exemplary in this regard.

<span id="page-407-0"></span>3:5 The home is the proving ground of a man's leadership potential in the church. Paul asks the rhetorical question, "If someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?" The answer is that he will not, and likely cannot. If a man cannot maintain order and discipline in his own home, he cannot be counted on to do better within the church.

<span id="page-407-3"></span><span id="page-407-1"></span>3:6 An overseer must not be a "recent convert." Paul does not specify how recent is too recent. If he had in mind a specific bare minimum of time, he did not make it known. What he has made known is that the overseer must have good character. As mentioned above, another Pauline term for overseer is *elder* (cf. 5:17), a term emphasizing maturity. A pastor must have proven character, which assumes enough time to prove that he really is who he says he is. It takes time, and time should provide evidence of maturity. If time does not provide such evidence, the qualifications have not been met. But faithfulness and good character over time is the proof. When this proof of endurance is lacking, there is a risk that an overseer might become prideful in his position, perhaps even calling his faith into question.

<span id="page-407-2"></span>3:7 A faithful pastor ought to be "well thought of by outsiders"; he must have a good reputation with those outside the church. If a man has a bad reputation outside the church, the witness of the entire church is damaged. There must be consistent character across the board. "For the leader to fail in one or more of the qualifications, opens him up to disgrace . . . and is either evidence of, or will lead to, coming under the devil's influence."33

### *Response*

"Above reproach" means that being a pastor involves much more than simply being an electrifying speaker. There are many men who seek to make themselves into compelling speakers. But this text makes clear that what the church truly needs is men of compelling holiness. Pastors cannot teach what they cannot do. They cannot—with credibility—stand before God's people and tell them what they ought to be and to do if they themselves are not what God has told them to be and to do. And this is why the baseline qualification for ministry is exemplary character.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-408-2"></span>In the first part of chapter 3, Paul has explained to Timothy the qualifications for the *leaders* of the church. In this passage, Paul lays out the qualifications for the recognized *servants* of the church. These servants are called *deacons*, and they constitute one of the two recognized offices of the church—elder and deacon. The deacon's qualifications are almost identical to those of the elder. The primary difference is that a deacon need not be able to teach, while the elder must be. The deacon's task is not to lead the church but to serve the church.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-408-3"></span><span id="page-408-1"></span><span id="page-408-0"></span>3:8–9 From this text and elsewhere, we know that the Bible recognizes two offices within the church: elder and deacon (cf. Phil. 1:1). Having set forth the qualifications for elders, Paul now does the same for deacons. The term translated "deacon" simply means *servant*. This office, therefore, is named for what it does: *serve*. The prototypical example of this service is found in Acts 6:1–6, where the apostles' ministry is hindered because of the need to distribute food to the widows. The widows need to eat. And the apostles need to preach the Word. But the apostles cannot preach if they are spending all of their time providing food service for widows.

<span id="page-409-2"></span>The apostles set a precedent showing the church what to do when the ministry of the Word is unduly encumbered by the demands of service. The apostles do not play one obligation against the other; neither the Word nor the widows should be neglected. So the apostles appoint servants (or "deacons," though they are not referred to by that term in Acts 6), seven men full of the spirit and of wisdom, who serve the widows so that the apostles may devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. These deacons are servants, men of character, who embody what it means to serve God by serving others.

The apostles recognized a need for servants in Acts 6. Likewise, Paul recognizes that servants will be needed by the church in Ephesus, and he instructs Timothy that the deacons "likewise" hold an office in the church that requires them to have exemplary character. Just as elders have to meet certain requirements of character, so also do deacons. The qualifications are similar to those for elders but not identical. Deacons must be:

(1) "Dignified," or "worthy of respect/honor, noble, dignified, serious" (BDAG, s.v. σεμνός). The deacon must not be the kind of man whom no one takes seriously. He must be someone whose character evokes respect and admiration.

(2) "Not double-tongued." The deacon must not trade in insincere, two-faced speech. He must be a truth-teller, not a people-pleaser, with his words.

(3) "Not addicted to much wine." The Greek term rendered "addicted" is translated elsewhere as "devoted" and indicates that the deacon must not be one who occupies himself with much wine (BDAG, s.v. προσέχω). Any man who is a "[hero] at drinking wine" (Isa. 5:22) but a failure at sobriety must not be a deacon (cf. Eph. 5:18).

<span id="page-409-3"></span><span id="page-409-0"></span>(4) "Not greedy for dishonest [or "sordid"] gain." A deacon cannot be someone who loves money. Any person who loves money more than God cannot be a disciple of Jesus, much less a deacon (Matt. 6:24).

<span id="page-409-1"></span>(5) One who "[holds to] the mystery of the faith." Whereas the elder must be "able to teach," the deacon does not hold that responsibility. But the deacon must nevertheless "hold [to] the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience." *Mystery* is a technical term in Paul's writings that refers to something once hidden but now revealed in the gospel. In short, the mystery of the faith is the gospel of Jesus Christ crucified and raised for sinners. To miss that message is to miss everything, and so a deacon has to know and believe that message. And he cannot do so with his fingers crossed. He must hold it "with a clear conscience."

<span id="page-409-4"></span>3:10 Paul calls for deacons to be "tested"—the church must not select someone to be a deacon simply for superficial reasons. On the contrary, his faithfulness must be proved. There must be enough time for potential deacons to have "[proved] themselves blameless," beyond reproach.

<span id="page-409-5"></span>3:11 In verse 11, Paul addresses "wives" (lit., "women"; Gk. *gynaikas*). Why would Paul include a reference to "women" in a passage about deacons? Some believe that Paul is implying that these are not wives but deaconesses. After all, the list <span id="page-410-0"></span>of qualifications for these women is very similar to that for deacons and even to that for elders. Why would Paul specify such qualifications if an office for women is not in view? Also, a woman named Phoebe is called a "servant" (using the same word translated here as "deacon") in Romans 16:1. Is Paul invoking the same office that Phoebe is said to hold in Romans 16:1? This is the argument offered by those who understand "women" to refer to female deacons.

<span id="page-410-5"></span>This line of reasoning is not persuasive. The underlying word is the typical Greek term for "woman" or "wife." The same word is used in the very next verse, where it clearly indicates "wife." Further, the word "likewise" suggests a group similar to but distinct from the diaconate (just as the word "likewise" in verse 8 suggests that deacons are similar to but distinct from the elders). Since Paul's instructions before and after verse 11 are focused on deacons, it makes more sense to see verse 11 as somehow related to deacon qualifications as well.

<span id="page-410-6"></span><span id="page-410-2"></span><span id="page-410-1"></span>Phoebe's designation as a *diakonos* (translated "servant" or "deacon") is unconvincing evidence of female deacons. *Diakonos* has semantic range, and not all uses of this term denote an office of the church (e.g., 1 Cor. 3:5; 2 Cor. 6:4). The mere use of the term *diakonos* in connection with someone from a particular church does not establish that the person in question was a deacon. With respect to Phoebe, I agree with the caution urged in the NET Bible's notes on Romans 16:1: "Epaphras is associated with the church in Colossians and is called a διάκονος in Col 1:7, but no contemporary translation regards him as a deacon. In 1 Tim 4:6 Paul calls Timothy a διάκονος; Timothy was associated with the church in Ephesus, but he obviously was not a deacon. In addition, the lexical evidence leans away from this view: Within the NT, the διακον- word group rarely functions with a technical nuance. In any case, the evidence is not compelling either way." At best, Phoebe's status as a deacon is less than certain and therefore can hardly establish the case for deaconesses in 1 Timothy 3:11. The ESV's rendering captures the correct sense of the term: "their wives" (i.e., "deacons' wives").

<span id="page-410-4"></span>Thus Paul is most likely teaching that the behavior of the deacon's wife must be exemplary (much like submissive children are an evidence of an elder's management of the home in 3:4). These women, whether or not they hold office, do hold responsibility for serving others. This is why they must bear character qualities fitted for a servant. Paul lists four such qualities:

(1) "Dignified" refers to one who is "worthy of respect/honor, noble, dignified, serious" (BDAG, s.v. σεμνός). This woman must command the respect of those who meet her.

<span id="page-410-3"></span>(2) "Not slanderers." They must not be malicious gossips.

(3) "Sober-minded." This term was attached to the elders in verse 2. It signifies that such women must not be drunkards but must be clear-minded and must exhibit good judgment.

(4) "Faithful in all things." Obviously, Paul is not demanding perfection. But such women must be "*trustworthy, faithful, dependable*" (BDAG, s.v. πιστός, italics original).

<span id="page-411-2"></span><span id="page-411-1"></span>3:12 Just like the elders, the deacon must be a "husband of one wife"—a onewoman man (cf. comment on 3:2). A deacon must prove his character by being faithful to his wife and, by extension, to the rest of his family. If a man loves his wife and disciplines his children and leads his home, he evidences that he is filled with the Spirit. Here again the home is the proving ground for ministry.

<span id="page-411-3"></span>3:13 Those who "serve well" are those who serve well in their official capacity as deacons. They have a "good standing" or rank in the church. This standing need not be an official rank but is simply a recognition by the congregation that this man has exhibited exemplary faithfulness. Such exemplary faithfulness leads to increasing influence, which may itself lead to more opportunities for service and leadership. Those who serve well as deacons also obtain for themselves "great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus." The term rendered "confidence" denotes freedom and boldness to speak.34 Like Stephen in his heroic martyrdom (Acts 6:10; 7:1–53), deacons may find that their service affords them opportunities to bear witness. Such faithful service leads to greater standing and confidence to speak about Christ and his gospel, for greater service reflects an increasing "faith" in Christ Jesus.

Should women serve as deacons? As discussed above, the evidence from Scripture in favor of female deacons is, at best, inconclusive. Do churches who recognize female deacons contradict the Bible's teaching about male headship and qualified male leadership in a church? The answer to that question is "No, not necessarily, but it might." Those women recognized as deacons would not be violating male headship so long as they had no ruling authority. But in many churches deacons function as non-shepherding leaders of the church. Even though they are called deacons, they hold implicit or explicit authority. In such churches, female deacons undermine biblical headship because the deacons are *de facto* if not actual elders.

Such churches do not have a biblical understanding of the diaconate. The deacons are functioning in a way that contradicts their biblical mandate and does not promote the maximum health of the church. The church does not need a board of directors called deacons. The church needs a board of shepherds called elders. And the church needs deacons who are full of the Spirit and who facilitate that ministry of the Word by their service.

### *Section Overview*

Paul now explains his purpose for writing this letter: to teach Timothy and the Christians in Ephesus how they ought to behave as a church. All of the foregoing instructions concerning men and women in worship and concerning elders and deacons are to the end of ordering God's household rightly. This short section explains what that household is and the message upon which it is built.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-412-1"></span><span id="page-412-0"></span>3:14 Paul loved not only Timothy but also Timothy's congregation (Acts 20:31). It is no surprise, therefore, that Paul wished to come to them in order to deliver these important instructions in person. But since he was not able to be with them, he writes "these things" so that he can communicate what is necessary for them to flourish in the faith. "These things" refers to everything Paul has written up to this point about false teachers, men and women gathered for worship, and elders and deacons. He is writing "these things" for the purpose announced in the following verse.

<span id="page-412-3"></span>3:15 Paul writes to explain how God's people are to conduct themselves in God's house. Their conduct is to be dictated in part by the knowledge that the church is not *their* house but *God's* house. Observations addressing three phrases in this verse help to explain what is expected of God's people:

(1) "The household of God." Just as a household has a certain order to it with husbands leading and wives helping and children obeying—so also God's household has a certain order to it. There are elders, there are deacons, and there are members. Since this is God's house, God defines the offices of the church and the roles and responsibilities of each office. This is not something we are to make up as we go along. This is God's house, God's order, and God's way of doing things.

<span id="page-413-2"></span>(2) "The church of the living God." Paul draws attention to the fact that this is the *church*—the entity Jesus himself says he is building (Matt. 16:18–19). He also draws attention to the fact that this church belongs to the "living God"—a common OT method of distinguishing the true God from dead idols (cf. Josh. 3:10; Ps. 42:2).

<span id="page-413-1"></span><span id="page-413-0"></span>(3) "A pillar and buttress of the truth." Paul accesses the imagery of a building to explain what the church is like. The church is to truth as buttresses and a foundation are to a building. The church of Jesus Christ exists as a foundation and support for the truth in the world by serving as an immovable and intractable witness. The world and the culture might change, but the bearers of God's truth must never change. They must tenaciously hang on to God's revelation no matter what else happens. The only kind of church able to do this is one rightly ordered, with elders and deacons leading and serving, with elders preaching the Word and shepherding God's people, with deacons serving and enabling that ministry, and with the congregation following such exemplary leadership. This type of church is the kind that will be a bulwark against error no matter how fierce the winds of change may blow.

<span id="page-413-7"></span>3:16 This verse summarizes the truth that the church contends for and must proclaim. The format of these verses suggests that this is probably an early apostolic creed or hymn containing a summary of the gospel truth that the church proclaims.

<span id="page-413-6"></span><span id="page-413-5"></span><span id="page-413-4"></span>"Mystery" is a technical term in Paul's writings (cf. comment on 3:8–9). It refers not to something currently hidden but to something formerly hidden but now revealed by Christ and his gospel (cf. 1 Cor. 2:7, 10; Eph. 1:9; 3:3; Col. 1:26). "Godliness" denotes the duty man owes to God in terms of both believing and living rightly (cf. 1 Tim. 2:2; 4:7; 6:11). The mystery of godliness, therefore, is the revelation of the duty that man owes to God. This duty is perfectly revealed by none other than Jesus himself in his life, ministry, and work on behalf of sinners. And that life, ministry, and work is summarized in the confession that follows.35

<span id="page-413-3"></span>One may easily detect in Paul's words what Towner calls a "subversive echo" of the slogans of the Artemis cult in Ephesus36 (cf. Acts 19:28, 34). A literal rendering of Paul's words in verse 16 will help to illustrate this comparison with the slogans in Acts:

<sup>35</sup> Mounce, *Pastoral Epistles*, 227.

<sup>36</sup> Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 277.

| of godliness.  | of the Ephesians.  |

TABLE 6.4: 1 Timothy 3:16 as a "Subversive Echo" of Artemis Worship

I do not suggest a formal literary dependence in illustrating these parallels. However, both Paul and Luke knew of the events narrated in Acts 19, and unless one denies the historicity of the Acts account, it seems likely that Paul is using this confession as a tailor-made rebuttal of what his readers in Ephesus might be hearing from adherents of the Artemis cult. The Ephesians claim that Artemis is "great." Paul asserts that the revelation of Jesus Christ is "great." The Ephesians claim that the greatness of Artemis "cannot be denied." Paul asserts that the greatness of Christ is "undeniable" (Gk. *homologoumenōs*; ESV "we confess"). The Ephesians claim that the image of Artemis "fell from the sky." Paul asserts that Jesus Christ came down from heaven in the sense of being "manifested in the flesh." But, whereas Artemis only "fell down," Christ has been "taken up in glory." Whereas Artemis is "of the Ephesians," Christ has been "proclaimed among the nations." In short, the gospel of Jesus Christ is the true and greater story. The myth of Artemis is just that: a parochial myth.

<span id="page-414-0"></span>"Manifested in the flesh" refers to the incarnation of Jesus. "Vindicated by the Spirit" refers to the resurrection, as the Spirit of God was active in raising Jesus from the dead (cf. Rom. 8:11). "Seen by angels" refers to the fact that Jesus' resurrection had heavenly witnesses. "Proclaimed among the nations" refers to the spread of the gospel in the world, and "Believed on in the world" refers to the response of the nations to that gospel. "Taken up in glory" is likely a reference to Jesus' ascent into heaven, from which he will one day return. This great revelation of Christ's redemptive work is far superior to anything on offer in the Artemis cult or any other religion.

### *Response*

God has called every single local church to be a pillar and support of the truth in a world running away from that truth. There are far too many churches that are slowly drifting away from the truth and accommodating themselves to the world. But this is not what God has called his church to do. A church might muddle along without faithful elders and deacons for a time. But that is not a long-term strategy for survival but rather a short-term situation until God's order can be restored and maintained in God's house. And that order involves qualified elders leading, qualified deacons serving, and a believing congregation holding fast to the mystery of godliness.

### <span id="page-415-2"></span>1 TIMOTHY 4:1–5

4 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, **<sup>2</sup>** through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, **3**who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. **4**For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, **<sup>5</sup>** for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-415-0"></span>Having outlined a brief confession of the Christian faith in 3:16, Paul now turns his attention to those who are falling away from that faith. He warns that, in these last days, some Christians will indeed leave the faith they once professed. They will do so by being led by errant teachers, who substitute false teaching for the truth of the gospel. These false teachers require an unnecessary forbidding of marriage and of certain kinds of food. The OT, however, teaches that both marriage and food are good and are given to God's people for their enjoyment and sustenance.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-415-3"></span><span id="page-415-1"></span>4:1 When Paul refers to the Spirit's speaking, it is not clear whether he means that the Spirit has revealed something directly to him or whether he is drawing on what the Spirit has said through Christian prophets elsewhere in the church at that time (we cannot rule out the possibility that Paul refers to OT prophecies; cf. 2 Pet. 2:1). What is clear is the identity and the content of the speech: the Spirit is warning God's people that some will fall away from the faith. They will no longer follow Christ. The English term *apostasy* is derived from the Greek term for "falling away" (Gk. *apostēsontai* ) that Paul employs here.

<span id="page-416-5"></span>For Paul, the "last days" were inaugurated by the coming of Christ, are characterized by the Spirit's presence among God's people, and will be consummated at Christ's return in glory.37 Thus Paul believes he is ministering in the last days, which are characterized by great godlessness in the world (cf. 2 Tim. 3:1–5). Jesus himself predicted that godlessness and apostasy would mark the last days (Matt. 24:10–13). In this way he prepared his church for the time in which people would listen to false teaching and fall away from him. Paul expresses the same concern for the Ephesian church in Acts 20:28–30.

<span id="page-416-2"></span><span id="page-416-1"></span>The warnings from Jesus and Paul both describe how such apostasy comes about. People begin to listen to false teaching, and heeding this teaching shipwrecks their faith. Apostates are turned away from Christ because they are turned away from his Word. They forsake his Word in order to listen to the spirit of the age, which is demonic.

<span id="page-416-3"></span>4:2 Paul says that false teaching comes into the church "through the insincerity of liars." "Insincerity" refers to hypocrisy—these false teachers have created a public impression at odds with who they really are (BDAG, s.v. ὑπόκρισις). They give the impression of being faithful Christians. They speak the language and understand and operate very comfortably within church culture. They may even have a reputation for a certain level of piety—perhaps they are gifted communicators. They give a public impression that puts congregants at ease and draws them in. But they are not really who they are pretending to be. They may look and sound like Christian teachers, but they are not. And this is what makes them so dangerous.

<span id="page-416-4"></span>4:3–4 The exact beliefs of the false teachers at Ephesus are unclear. From this verse, however, we see that these false teachers tell God's people that they should not marry and not eat certain kinds of food. We cannot be certain why the false teachers would forbid these things. Abstaining from certain kinds of food sounds like it might be an OT-related error, but that would not explain the prohibition of marriage. All we can be certain of is what Paul says here.

<span id="page-416-0"></span>Paul brushes aside these prohibitions by appealing to the Bible. God has created both marriage and food to be enjoyed gratefully. The false teachers' prohibitions contradict the doctrine of creation taught in Genesis 1–2, which declares that God created everything and called what he created "good." The only evaluation of "not good" is when God notes that it is not good for man to be alone; in response, God creates the woman and gives her to the man in marriage. Thus Paul is simply applying the Genesis creation account to the error propagated in Ephesus. The contrast is stark: the false teachers claim that marriage and some kinds of food are bad, but Scripture makes clear that both marriage and food are good. Christians should base their evaluation on what God says, not on what false teachers claim.

Paul then clarifies that it is possible to pursue marriage and food in a way that is sinful. It is possible to make an idol out of sex or food in such a way that one enjoys it for its own sake and not for the Lord's sake. So Paul clarifies that everything created by God is good "if it is received with thanksgiving." Those who enjoy God's good gifts without rendering thanks to God are sinning. The sin occurs not because the gifts themselves are bad but because the recipient is an idolater.

<span id="page-417-1"></span>4:5 Paul now summarizes his reasoning to this point. In this context "made holy" means suitable for use (BDAG, s.v. ἁγιάζω). Marriage and food are made suitable by God's spoken word (because he spoke them into existence and declared them to be good) and by our prayerful thanksgiving (by which we worship the Giver and not the gifts).

The false teachers are leading the Ephesian Christians away from good things. They may be promising the good life, but they lie. They are taking away God's Word and his good gifts to his people.

### *Response*

False teachers are effective at leading the sheep astray because they look like sheep themselves. And usually they look like exceptional sheep. Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, and the wolves disguise themselves as sheep. Thus we cannot take our cues from the public image that teachers create for themselves. We must look at their fruit and their teaching to see whether or not they match up with scriptural norms.

<span id="page-417-2"></span><span id="page-417-0"></span>A sincere false teacher is still a false teacher. Notice that these false teachers' consciences are "seared" (v. 2)—they can no longer sense the difference between right and wrong. They may be absolutely sincere in their error, but that makes it no less an error. Nor does it make it any less a threat to the faith. In fact, the sincerity may make the situation more dangerous.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-418-2"></span>In chapter 3 Paul outlines the qualifications for overseers. In chapter 4 he outlines the job description of an overseer. An overseer becomes a "good servant of Christ Jesus" by being trained in the words of the faith, avoiding false teaching, training himself for godliness, and setting his hope on the living God.

		- 3. A Good Servant Is Hoping in the Living God (4:10)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-418-3"></span>4:6 "Good servant" refers to a faithful overseer. Although Paul is addressing Timothy specifically in this letter, his instructions by extension apply to all who lead the church by filling the role of elder as outlined in the letter. "These things" refers to what Paul has said in previous verses concerning the goodness of creation as taught in Genesis 1–2. Thus a good servant of Christ Jesus must be devoted to the word of God. Paul identifies three ways in which an overseer proves that he is so devoted.

<span id="page-418-4"></span><span id="page-418-0"></span>First, an overseer must teach the Word (v. 6a). This is what Paul means by his command to "put these things before the brothers." In essence, a "good servant" is one who confronts false teaching with the truth of Scripture. To "put these things" involves not just teaching what the Bible says but also refuting that which contradicts what the Bible says. It must include both.

<span id="page-418-5"></span>Second, an overseer must live the Word (v. 6b). On this point, Paul is careful to point out that the good servant is "being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed." "Being trained" means, at its Greek root, to receive food, to be nourished.38 For the faithful pastor, the Bible is like his food; as Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). Being nourished on God's Word involves not merely learning it but also following it.

<span id="page-418-7"></span><span id="page-418-6"></span><span id="page-418-1"></span>4:7 Third, an overseer must reject that which opposes the Word (v. 7a). Paul describes the error as "irreverent, silly myths." "Myths" emphasizes the untruthfulness of the error. But these are not just any myths. They are irreverent and silly—they are godless and common and transparently false. Literally, they are "fit only for old women" (NASB), an idiom akin to our expression "old wives' tales." A good servant of Christ Jesus will not let himself be carried away by irreverent and silly myths.

<sup>38</sup> Louw and Nida, *Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament*, §33.242.

The alternative to heeding foolish and silly myths is to "train yourself for godliness." "Train" (*gymnazō*) involves an athletic image that brings to mind the idea of physical training, of training and undergoing discipline in order to triumph in competition. Here the objective of the training is godliness, that is, devotedness or piety toward God (BDAG). Thus the exertion of training and resolve has nothing to do with improving oneself physically but is focused instead on improving oneself spiritually. When an athlete is training for competition, he pursues training that makes him bigger, faster, and stronger while avoiding that which makes him smaller, slower, or weaker. Likewise, a person disciplining himself for godliness pursues things that make him holier and more Christlike while avoiding everything that makes him unholier and less Christlike. The "words of the faith and of the good doctrine" (4:6) will make Timothy stronger, while "irreverent and silly myths" will only make him weaker. The discipline that leads to godliness is the daily and consistent pursuit of the one and the avoidance of the other. Paul calls for a lifestyle that requires discipline, for the world and the flesh desire to pursue silly myths and to avoid the Word of God.

<span id="page-419-2"></span><span id="page-419-1"></span>4:8 Paul explains why a "good servant" would train himself in this unusual, spiritual way. The usual way of physical discipline has value only for this life, while the unusual way of discipline—spiritual discipline—has value both for this life and for the one to come.

But notice that Paul does not say that physical discipline is of "no value"; it is of "some value." There are benefits to physical discipline. A person can be healthier through physical discipline, and he may live longer, too. There is some profit to physical discipline, and the wise person should not avoid it. But physical exercise ultimately provides only some benefit, because death is unavoidable. Physical fitness will ultimately be gone with the wind. The life will go out of the body, it will be returned to dust, and the corpse will decompose.

Godliness, however, is valuable for all time because it has the "promise for the present life and also for the life to come." Godliness teaches a person that God will do for his corpse what physical training could never do: he will raise the corpse to life, making it new, immortal, and glorious. Paul calls Timothy to train himself for godliness, which will teach him to store up treasures for the age to come rather than for this temporary age.

4:9 On "the saying is trustworthy," see comment on 1:15. Some commentators think the "trustworthy" saying refers to what follows in verse 10, but more likely it refers to what Paul has said about godliness in the preceding verse. The phrase "deserving of full acceptance" is added twice to Paul's "trustworthy" sayings (1 Tim. 1:15; 4:9) to emphasize the need for all to respond by believing and obeying the teaching.

<span id="page-419-3"></span><span id="page-419-0"></span>4:10 Paul "toils" and "strives" for a purpose. He aims not for what fades away but for what lasts. And what lasts is what God redeems. Paul says we "toil" and "strive" for godliness because it leads to life—not temporary mortal life but eternal life. Paul can labor and strive and suffer the loss of all things in this life because he knows that he is going to get it all back, and then some, in the next. Paul explains why he toils and agonizes in his ministry: "because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe."

<span id="page-420-0"></span>"Living God" is an OT way of referring to God in contrast to dead idols (e.g., Deut. 5:26; Josh. 3:10). God is alive, and God gives life. It is this God who is the Savior of all men—meaning that God can raise anyone from the dead.

What does it mean that God is the Savior of all people? How can that be true, since not all people are saved? And what does it mean that God "especially" saves believers? Are some believers saved in a *special* way, while others are saved differently?

<span id="page-420-2"></span><span id="page-420-1"></span>Paul uses "all people" language elsewhere, and it is clear that he does not mean "all people" without exception. In 1 Timothy 2:1 and 2:4, Paul says that there should be prayers for "all people" and that God desires "all people" to be saved. In 4:10, Paul says that God is the Savior of "all people." But Paul is not saying in chapter 4 that "all people" without exception are saved any more than he was saying so in chapter 2. We know that Paul does not mean "all people" without exception in part because of the last phrase, which perhaps should be translated not as "especially believers" but as "namely believers."39 Paul's logic goes like this: "We are laboring and striving because we know that God is going to come through for us who believe." Thus Paul expresses his confidence that whatever he loses in the struggle he will regain when God's salvation is complete in the age to come.

### *Response*

Some preachers think they are serving their people if they deliver eloquent theological discourses that are long on concept but short on connection to people in the pew. Everything they are saying is true but perhaps it goes over the congregation's head. Charles Haddon Spurgeon confronted this problem with a pointed quip:

Christ said, "Feed My sheep. . . . Feed My lambs." Some preachers, however, put the food so high that neither lambs nor sheep can reach it. They seem to have read the text, "Feed My giraffes."40

Spurgeon is being lighthearted here but is making a serious point. A preacher has the responsibility to "put these things before the brothers" in a way that doctors and plumbers and lawyers and housewives and factory workers can all understand. A preacher's job is not to complicate simplicity but to simplify complexity. Unfortunately, too many do the former. A good servant of Christ Jesus preaches the Word in a way that connects to people.

<sup>39</sup> The word translated "especially" could also mean "namely." See T. C. Skeat, "'Especially the Parchments': A Note on 2 Timothy IV.13," *Journal of Theological Studies* 30/1 (1979): 173–177.

<sup>40</sup> William Williams, *Personal Reminiscences of Charles Haddon Spurgeon*, 2nd ed. (London: Religious Tract Society, 1895), 145.

An old saying about pastors is worth repeating here. "If your output exceeds your input, your upkeep will be your downfall." If a pastor exhorts everybody else to do things that he himself is not doing, his exterior appearance will be at odds with who he really is. A pastor will not be able to maintain such hypocrisy indefinitely; ultimately, he will be exposed and discredited. A good servant of Christ Jesus is not only teaching the Word. He is *living* it, constantly nourishing himself by the words of the faith and of sound doctrine.

In this final paragraph (vv. 11–16), Paul finishes what he started by saying that the faithful overseer must be exemplary to his people. He must be the model that they follow in order to walk faithfully with Jesus.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-421-3"></span>4:11 "Command and teach" refers to the ordinary work of a pastor: preaching the Word of God to the people of God, whether in the gathered assembly or in private interaction. Paul orders Timothy to exhort and preach "these things," i.e., everything highlighted in the previous paragraph. Thus Timothy is to point out the Word of God to God's people and to warn against any teaching or practice contradicting God's Word. Such is what a faithful servant does. In the previous section Paul also explained that bodily discipline is of little value, whereas godliness has profit for all things because it comes with the assurance of eternal life (vv. 8–10). And now Paul directs Timothy to "command and teach these things." Preaching must be in the imperative mood. It is not abstract theologizing but involves concrete commands to believe and obey the Word of Christ.

<span id="page-422-7"></span><span id="page-422-6"></span><span id="page-422-0"></span>4:12 Paul anticipates a problem in Timothy's ministry—that people might look down on him because of his relative youth. This term for "youth" refers to adult married men in the LXX (Prov. 5:18); thus its usage here does not imply that Timothy is a child—he could be in his thirties at this point.41 Nevertheless, some of the older believers might be tempted to look down on Timothy for being so young and might thus dismiss his teaching. They might say, "What right does he have to tell us what to do? What does he know about marriage? I have been at this for a lot longer than he has. What does he know?"

<span id="page-422-8"></span>Paul says, in effect, "Do not let them treat you in this way." If Timothy were operating from a carnal perspective, he might try to force the issue by asserting his rightful authority (Heb. 13:17). But this approach is unlikely to win anyone's respect. Timothy will gain respect not by trying to force people to respect him but by being respectable. The antidote to a congregation's looking down on a pastor is for the pastor to give them something to look up to instead. Thus Paul writes, "set the believers an example." Timothy is not to put on a show for the sake of the congregation; he is to exhibit the type of character that people will want to imitate (cf. Phil. 3:17; Titus 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:2–3).

<span id="page-422-5"></span>Paul spells out very clearly how Timothy is to model exemplary traits: "in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity." The first two items on this list are *realms* of activity—what he says (speech) and what he does (conduct). Everything Timothy says and does must be exemplary. The last three items are *qualities* defining how Timothy is to speak and behave.

<span id="page-422-4"></span><span id="page-422-3"></span>(1) "Speech." Exemplary speech is marked by truth (Eph. 4:25), wholesome edification (Eph. 4:29), purity, and thankfulness (Eph. 5:4).

<span id="page-422-10"></span><span id="page-422-9"></span>(2) "Conduct" refers to a person's "way of life" (BDAG, s.v. ἀναστροφή). The same term appears in 1 Peter 1:14–15, which calls for holy conduct. Conduct in this sense is observable (1 Peter 2:12), so Paul tells Timothy that his conduct must be exemplary—something that others can see and imitate. In the next three items on the list, he states what this conduct should look like.

<span id="page-422-2"></span>(3) "Love" is the first fruit of the Spirit mentioned in Galatians 5:22—it is the defining Christian virtue. If someone does not have love, he is not a believer (1 John 4:8). Paul defines the essence of love in 1 Corinthians 13:4–7.

<span id="page-422-1"></span><sup>41</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 205.

<span id="page-423-1"></span>(4) "Faith" is another fruit of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5:22, which means that it will be manifest in some measure in every person who has the Spirit. But Timothy is to be someone who exhibits exemplary trust in the Lord Jesus.

<span id="page-423-9"></span>(5) "Purity" appears one other time in the NT, at 1 Timothy 5:2, where Paul tells Timothy to treat "younger women as sisters, in all purity." Thus the idea behind this term is not moral purity in general but sexual purity in particular.42 Indeed, we might even translate it "chastity" (BDAG, s.v. ἁγνεία). Timothy must be an exemplar of sexual purity.

<span id="page-423-5"></span>4:13 Paul says to "devote yourself to the public reading." To "devote" is to "turn your mind to" or "occupy yourself with."43 Paul uses the same word in relation to the false teachers who fall away from the faith: they give attention to "deceitful spirits and teachings of demons" (4:1). But it must not be so with Timothy. He must occupy his mind with reading, explaining, and exhorting from Scripture.

<span id="page-423-3"></span><span id="page-423-0"></span>"Public reading of Scripture" is actually one word in Greek, literally "the reading aloud." It is a technical term in the NT for what happens in the Jewish synagogue service (cf. Acts 13:15; 2 Cor. 3:14): "reading aloud" of Scripture. This particular feature of the synagogue liturgy is now carried over into the life of the Christian church. There is to be "public reading of Scripture" whenever the church meets.

This term tells us that Paul is moving from Timothy's personal character to his public ministry when the church gathers. In addition to "the public reading of Scripture," there must also be "exhortation" and "teaching." The "teaching" would involve telling the congregation what the text means, and how it lines up with what the rest of the Bible says and the apostle's teaching. "Exhortation" calls on hearers to respond in obedience to the Scripture read and taught.

<span id="page-423-6"></span>4:14 Timothy has been given the gift of exhorting and teaching as a sheer act of grace. The "prophecy" and the "council of elders [that] laid their hands on you" are the public attestations to Timothy's pastoral ministry. Someone confirmed Timothy's calling through prophecy, and the entire body of elders affirmed him when they laid their hands on him. A true calling to pastoral ministry will not be mere subjective feeling. It will also involve objective affirmation from the church. So Timothy has this gift—which has been affirmed objectively—and Paul is telling him not to neglect it. He must work to improve his God-given ability to shepherd and to teach.

<span id="page-423-7"></span>4:15 The pastor should be working on growth. He must be absolutely absorbed with the Word of God, taking pains to learn and to obey the Bible. Timothy is to do so in a way that is evident: "so that all may see your progress"—so that he can be an example to everyone in the congregation.

<span id="page-423-8"></span><span id="page-423-2"></span>4:16 The first phrase of this verse sums up everything Paul has said in chapter 4. Timothy must "keep a close watch" on himself (i.e., "train yourself for godliness"; v. 7) and his teaching (e.g., "practice these things, immerse yourself in them";

<span id="page-423-4"></span><sup>42</sup> Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 316.

<sup>43</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 207.

<span id="page-424-2"></span>v. 15.). In other words, there must be integrity between Timothy's behavior and his doctrine. Paul then adds the crucial element: Timothy must not only "Do these things" but must "persist" in them. To "persist" is to persevere in these duties, no matter the obstacle.

Paul seeks Timothy's perseverance not only in personal holiness but also in public ministry. He must persevere in reading Scripture, explaining Scripture, and exhorting obedience to Scripture. Timothy must not give up on these things. The next phrase explains why this perseverance is important: "for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers." It may sound strange to hear that a pastor can "save" the people to whom he preaches. Indeed, some commentators have even suggested that "save" is referring not to eternal salvation but to something else. There are other places in Scripture that speak of one human being's "saving" another. In those contexts, the term refers to persons who are "mediators of divine salvation" (BDAG, s.v. σῴζω; cf. Rom. 11:13–14; 1 Cor. 7:16; 9:22; James 5:20; Jude 23). When Paul speaks in this way, he is not claiming that the person in question is the ultimate cause of anyone's salvation. He is merely speaking of Timothy as the *means* by which God brings salvation to people. God's sovereignty in this work does not negate the means he uses to bring salvation. God has chosen to use his people to bring his word to sinners, and a faithful preacher is a crucial part of God's plan.

### <span id="page-424-3"></span><span id="page-424-1"></span>*Response*

Paul has just given us a definition of what the ministry of the Word ought to be like. A pastor's public ministry of the Word should include reading the Bible, explaining the Bible, and exhorting people to obey the Bible. If a pastor is not reading and explaining the Bible's meaning, then he is not preaching, and whatever exhortation such a pastor does will be weak because it will not grow out of the message of Scripture. Pastors must pursue all three tasks: reading, explaining, and exhorting.

<span id="page-424-0"></span>For pastors, perseverance is not only necessary for their own salvation. It is also necessary for the congregation's salvation. As godly pastors persevere in love and good works, people see it and glorify God who is in heaven (cf. Matt. 5:16). As godly pastors preach and teach the Word of God, people hear it, repent, believe, and are saved. This is the work of God, and he chooses to use pastors to do it. They are the tools in his hand.

### <span id="page-425-3"></span>1 TIMOTHY 5:1–8

5 Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father, younger men as brothers, **<sup>2</sup>** older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.

**<sup>3</sup>**Honor widows who are truly widows. **4**But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. **<sup>5</sup>** She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day, **6**but she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. **7**Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach. **8**But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-425-1"></span><span id="page-425-0"></span>In chapter 4, Paul exhorted Timothy to be an example to the flock in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. In chapter 5, Paul explains *how* Timothy is to be pursue godliness in his relationships with others in the congregation. Timothy must confront the wolves but at the same time shepherd the sheep. His job is not to devour the sheep but to feed them, yet he cannot do so if he is not relating to them in constructive ways. So Paul instructs Timothy about how to treat older men, older women, younger men, and younger women in the congregation. Paul also instructs Timothy about how to care for widows.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-425-2"></span>5:1 The first two verses revolve around the two commands in verse 1: "do not rebuke" and "encourage." It is clear that the two commands apply equally to every personality in the list that follows. If we were to fill-in the ellipses, the sense would be as follows:

 Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father. *Do not rebuke* younger men, *but encourage them* as brothers. *Do not rebuke* older women, *but encourage them* as mothers. *Do not rebuke* younger women, *but encourage them* as sisters, in all purity.

<span id="page-426-5"></span>At first glance, it can be surprising to hear Paul forbidding Timothy from rebuking. That would seem to contradict what Paul has said elsewhere about the necessity of rebuking false teachers (1 Tim. 1:3; 2 Tim. 2:25; Titus 1:9) and what the Bible says generally about the goodness of a faithful rebuke (Prov. 17:10; 27:5; 28:23).

<span id="page-426-3"></span><span id="page-426-2"></span>Rebukes can be life-giving and helpful, but that is not the kind of "rebuke" in view here. The literal sense of the Greek term is to beat something or someone with the fists. In certain contexts the term suggests physical violence, but it can also mean something like "speak harshly." It is possible to abuse someone with fists; it is possible also to abuse someone with words. Timothy should not verbally assault his congregants: he must not lord his authority over the flock by berating them (1 Pet. 5:3; cf. Matt. 20:25; Mark 10:42).

<span id="page-426-4"></span>Timothy is not to obliterate but is to conciliate with his words. The term translated "encourage" usually has the sense of strongly appealing to someone, urging or exhorting him or her to do something. It is thus likely that Paul has in view the manner in which a pastor exhorts his people in his teaching and preaching ministry. The term also has the added sense of speaking in a conciliatory, friendly manner, a nuance Paul seems to intend here. Even if the pastor must confront, he must do so in a way that respects the person addressed. A wise and courageous pastor will always remember Solomon's words when exhorting his people: "There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts, but the tongue of the wise brings healing" (Prov. 12:18). Even in confrontation, a pastor's aim is not to deliver the *coup de grâce* but to heal.

<span id="page-426-0"></span>First, Paul says that Timothy must not speak harshly to "an older man" but exhort him as he would a father. Timothy should avoid talking down to a man who is older than he. Even if an older man is wrong and needs correction, Timothy must draw not the sword but the scalpel. He ought to speak with the same respect he would accord to his own father. If a pastor pulls a sword, he may destroy the older man. Or it is just as likely that the older man may draw his sword as well, and the ensuing verbal duel can cause division and get out of hand very quickly. "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger" (Prov. 15:1).

<span id="page-426-1"></span>Second, Timothy must not speak harshly to "younger men" but exhort them as brothers. Addressing younger men is different from addressing older men; both situations require respect, but expressed in different ways. A pastor will not say, "Yes, sir" and "No, sir" to a younger man, but neither will he talk down to him. He must treat younger men like brothers. A pastor must respect the younger men in a way that is due their age and station. This calls for honesty, truthfulness, and forbearance.

<span id="page-427-2"></span>5:2 Third, Timothy must not speak harshly to "older women" but must encourage them as mothers. A pastor must not treat women who are his seniors with careless disregard. Rather, he should care for them and speak to them as he would his own mother. The respect required for older men is also called for in relating to older women. But there may be an added dynamic that Paul wishes to accent. A man has a kind of built-in protectiveness when it comes to his own mother. Perhaps Paul is appealing to this sensibility as well and calling Timothy to have a sense of protectiveness for the elder women of the congregation.

<span id="page-427-0"></span>Fourth, Timothy must not speak harshly to "younger women" but must encourage them as sisters "in all purity." Pastors must treat younger women with the respect due their age and station. But Paul adds one more element: Timothy is to treat them "in all purity." The word translated "purity" occurs only two times in the NT, here and in 4:12: "Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in *purity*." The word indicates moral purity, and its connection with younger women here indicates that Paul has sexual purity specifically in mind.

Paul adds this note about sexual purity likely because a particular pitfall is all too common: sexual immorality. A pastor who has learned the art of communicating with warmth and compassion can easily find himself in a situation of emotional connection with a woman with whom he ought not have such a connection. And so, there must be no hint of impropriety in his ministry to younger women.

Paul places two obligations on Timothy's relationship to younger women. He must treat them "in all purity" *and* "as sisters." On the one hand, he must relate to these young women "in all purity." He must learn to look at these women and to talk to them in ways that neither imply nor intend any possibility of sexual interest. There are certain emotional and physical connections that are appropriate only to marriage, and Timothy must avoid making those connections with women who are not his spouse. He must relate "in all purity."

On the other hand, Timothy has an obligation to relate to these young women as "sisters." He must not simply withdraw entirely from relating to the women of the congregation. Sibling relationships show us that it is possible to have a warm brotherly love for a person of the opposite sex involving no sexual intention or possibility. Accordingly, Paul presses the familial analogy in his teaching concerning sexual purity.

<span id="page-427-3"></span><span id="page-427-1"></span>5:3 In verses 1–2, Paul has told Timothy how he must treat different kinds of people in the congregation. Among other things, Paul instructs Timothy to treat the older women as mothers. But what if one of these older women loses her husband to death? In verses 3–8, Paul says that Timothy must teach the church to treat these widows as they would their own mothers—they must take care of them.

<span id="page-427-4"></span>The word translated "widow" indicates a woman whose husband has died, but the idea of neediness is often associated with this word as well (BDAG). Elsewhere this word is paired with "orphan"—another class of persons with great need. So

1 Timothy 5:1–8 428

while it may be clear that a woman is a widow, it is not always equally clear whether there is great *neediness* in her life. The ones "who are truly widows" are those who are truly destitute.

<span id="page-428-0"></span>Timothy must "honor" such widows. The word translated "honor" appears in the fifth commandment in Exodus 20:12 (LXX), "Honor [*tima*] your father and your mother." To treat an older widow as a mother means to "honor" her in the sense commanded in Exodus. The honor in view is not merely reverence and respect but also honor in the sense found in the word *honorarium*. To honor such widows means to provide material help when needed (cf. Mark 7:10–12).

<span id="page-428-5"></span><span id="page-428-3"></span>5:4 The primary responsibility of providing for widows belongs, however, to the widow's family, rather than to the church. Why? Because that honor is *owed* to her by her own family. The phrase Paul uses here is actually redundant—her children are literally to "give back a recompense" (ESV "make some return") to her. Paul's logic assumes that a widow's offspring owe her for the way she raised and took care of them.

How could anyone ever repay his or her mother for what she gave them? By taking care of her in her time of need. She is the mother of her own children, and it is her children's privilege and responsibility to compensate her for the goodness she bestowed on them. When children do so, it is "pleasing in the sight of God." In other words, God expects children to care for their aging mothers. Jesus himself gives no quarter to those who would set aside God's Word about honoring father and mother (Matt. 15:3–9). Jesus recognizes that honoring one's parents means providing for them financially when they are in need. Jesus modeled this priority by honoring his own mother as he died on the cross (John 19:26–27).

<span id="page-428-6"></span><span id="page-428-4"></span><span id="page-428-2"></span>5:5 Paul describes the character of a woman who is "truly a widow." These mothers of the church are manifestly and truly followers of Jesus. The list of descriptors confirms this: (1) she hopes in God, (2) she appeals to him for help, (3) she prays in worship to him alone, and (4) she perseveres in this continually, "night and day." In short, she is a believer, and her piety toward God proves it.

<span id="page-428-7"></span>5:6 In contrast, the one "who is self-indulgent" is not "truly" (cf. v. 5) a widow. The word rendered "self-indulgent" describes one who seeks to "indulge oneself beyond the bounds of propriety, *live luxuriously/voluptuously*" (BDAG, s.v. σπαταλάω, italics original). Ezekiel uses this term to describe the sin of Sodom: "Moreover this was the sin of thy sister Sodom, pride: she and her daughters *lived in pleasure*, in fullness of bread and in abundance: this belonged to her and her daughters, and they helped not the hand of the poor and needy" (Ezek. 16:49 LXX). The widow who lives for pleasure is "dead even while she lives." She does not have the life of God in her; she is not a disciple of Jesus. Thus she is not a part of the family and is not "truly" a widow. Such women are not eligible for the church's support.

<span id="page-428-8"></span><span id="page-428-1"></span>5:7–8 Some interpreters believe that verse 7 is aimed at the behavior of the widows. It is more likely, however, that the exhortation is intended for the children and

<span id="page-429-1"></span>grandchildren of widows. With regards to caring for the aging widows in their own family, the family members must be "without reproach" (cf. comment on "above reproach," 3:2). Those who refuse to care for their own family members are behaving in a manner *worse* than unbelievers. This is not behavior that brings honor to the gospel; on the contrary, it is an implicit denial of the faith.

### *Response*

I once heard a story about a female seminary student who said "hello" to a male classmate before class started. His response to her was, "I am married," and then he turned away. This misses the mark. Church leaders must strive for holiness, but they must be careful not to let their striving turn into stiff-arming the younger women of the congregation. How arrogant it is to assume that, if a female says "hello," she is seeking to be a home-wrecker. Yes, a pastor must be vigilant (cf. Proverbs 5), but he must not be so cynical that ordinary conversation with a Christian woman is interpreted by him as a sexual advance.

<span id="page-429-0"></span>What does it communicate to a sister in Christ if a pastor treats her in such a way? It tells her that his mind is preoccupied with wrongful thoughts. It tells her that he views her very existence as a threat to his own holiness. It communicates that he is *not* thinking of her as a sister "in all purity."

A godly pastor will use his words not as a sword but as a scalpel. A sword and a scalpel are both made for cutting, but a sword is for killing while a scalpel is for healing. Some pastors think that, if they are not getting through to their people, they need to yell louder. But Paul says that a godly pastor must not hammer people with his words. Instead, he will pursue his ministry with sensitivity to the different kinds of people to whom he ministers. A pastor must not treat the congregation in an undifferentiated way. He must treat people in a way that respects their age and station of life. Pastors will minister to all different kinds of people in a given congregation, but Paul tells Timothy to treat every one of them like family. And there are appropriate ways to treat family members.

Churches have the responsibility to take care of those who are widows indeed. But before the church begins its support, individual believers are commanded by God to provide for their own mothers. We can start now to make plans to take care of our aging parents, and to communicate such plans to them.

### <span id="page-430-3"></span>1 TIMOTHY 5:9–16

**9**Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been the wife of one husband,*<sup>1</sup>* **<sup>10</sup>** and having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, has shown hospitality, has washed the feet of the saints, has cared for the afflicted, and has devoted herself to every good work. **11**But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry **<sup>12</sup>** and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith. **13**Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not. **<sup>14</sup>** So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. **15**For some have already strayed after Satan. **<sup>16</sup>** If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are truly widows.

1Or *a woman of one man*

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-430-0"></span>Some commentators view verses 9–16 as additional instructions about how to care for the needy widows of verses 3–8. But it seems unlikely that the apostle would put such a strict age qualification on those who are eligible for charity. Verses 3–8 presuppose that a widow's need determines the church's willingness to provide help, and that need would certainly be felt also by many widows under sixty years of age. It seems that two groups, therefore, may be in view here.

<span id="page-430-1"></span>Additionally, verses 3–16 appear to be divided into two paragraphs, each governed by its own imperative verb. Verse 3–8 deal with those widows who are to be "honored" by the congregation with financial support. Verses 9–16 deal primarily with those widows who are to be "enrolled." The first group is marked out by their destitution and need. The second group is marked out by a specific set of qualifications, including seniority, marital faithfulness, and a reputation for good works.44

<span id="page-430-2"></span>This commentary supports the view that verse 9 introduces a special group of widows who have a more formal role of service in the church's ministry. The view of some commentators that Paul has in mind an official "order of widows" goes too far,45 but it does seem that there was "some kind of register with a specific age qualification."46 There may very well have been overlap between the two groups

<sup>46</sup> Guthrie, *New Testament Introduction*, 116.

<span id="page-431-1"></span>(those from vv. 3–8 and those from vv. 9–16). Thus this list comprises women who *may* be supported by the church and who also make a vow to remain a widow and perhaps to render special service among the church's ministry.

Paul discourages placing younger widows on the list and encourages them to marry instead. Finally, he describes how younger widows may remarry and faithfully serve their own families by caring for their own dependent widows.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-431-2"></span>5:9–10 The previous passage (vv. 3–8) deals with the church's general obligation to care for widows who have no one else to care for them. This passage speaks of a narrower group of widows whose names are placed on a list (i.e., "enrolled"). Not every woman who is "truly" a widow goes on this list, but only those who meet a certain set of qualifications. Paul lists three:

(1) "Not less than sixty years of age." An enrolled woman must be mature in the faith and must have taken a vow not to remarry but to remain unmarried (cf. vv. 11–12).

<span id="page-431-4"></span>(2) "The wife of one husband." Paul is not specifying this as a contrast to polyandry (having multiple husbands), because that practice was not known in Paul's time. Nor is he disqualifying women who remarried after their husbands died, since he exhorts younger widows to do that very thing in the following verses. The best way to understand this phrase is the same way in which we understood the corresponding phrase applied to elders in 3:2, "the husband of one wife." Just like the elder has to be a "one-woman man," the widows on this list have to have been a "one-man woman." The phrase expresses the woman's exclusive, faithful devotion to her husband over the course of their marriage.

<span id="page-431-3"></span><span id="page-431-0"></span>(3) "A reputation for good works." The rest of verse 10 list four specific items that constitute "good works," and then the list ends with a bookend indicating that the widow has a track record of following "every good work." Such good works include:

- (a) Bringing up children. Raising children is the primary job of a mother. This can include raising orphans, but for most of these women this will involve raising children they bore themselves.
- (b) Showing hospitality. In addition to raising her own children, the widow must have practiced hospitality. Her home was not to have been a fortress against outsiders but a place of blessing and provision for others.
- (c) Washing "the feet of the saints." This woman has to have been a servant. In the ancient world, footwashing was one of the most menial of tasks. When people came into a home after a journey, their sandaled feet were often sweaty and caked with dirt, and someone had the lowly job of washing those feet. This recalls the example that Jesus provided when he washed his disciples' feet. This woman is a servant like Jesus; she does not think of herself as being above menial work.
- <span id="page-432-4"></span>(d) Caring "for the afflicted." This could be a reference to persecuted Christians. More likely, however, Paul refers to those who are "afflicted" in the sense of James 1:27. This woman has cared for needy people.

All four of these good works are focused on serving others, not oneself. Further, all four of these activities are based in the woman's home. They grow not from a home in disarray but rather from one that is well-ordered.

The only type of woman who can be enrolled is one with a proven track record of these kinds of good works, because these women are to have a part in the church's ministry. The good works at which these women excelled, the church now calls on them to do on the church's behalf.47

<span id="page-432-1"></span>This does not mean that the church refuses to help other widows. On the contrary, the church still has an obligation to support those who are "truly widows" (cf. vv. 3–8). Nor does this mean that Paul mandates all churches to have such a list of ministry widows. It does mean, however, that there is a scriptural basis for women in ministry who are in the employ of the church.

<span id="page-432-2"></span>5:11–12 There is another kind of widow who should not be placed on the list: "younger widows." Those widows who have the opportunity to remarry should pursue marriage. A younger woman is more likely to feel the desire to be married again. Paul says of them that "their passions" may "draw them away from Christ." Then, when they marry, they "incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith." This does not mean that widows are consigned to hell, as if marriage were tantamount to apostasy. The word for "faith" can also be translated "pledge" (cf. NASB). The women on the list apparently make a vow to God never to remarry, a vow that is abandoned if they decide later to marry. The word translated "condemnation" is applied to believers elsewhere and thus does not always refer to eternal punishment (e.g., 1 Cor. 11:29, 34; James 3:1). In this context it has the nuance of "censure." When widows remarry after pledging not to do so, they have their own home to care for and can no longer fulfill the ministry to which they have committed themselves. Thus it is better for such younger women not to be placed on the list in the first place.

<span id="page-432-3"></span><span id="page-432-0"></span>5:13 In addition to potentially breaking a pledge, a younger unmarried widow may be at greater risk of becoming an "idler." If she does not have proven character, she may not fulfill the ministry of the enrolled widows. If a church enrolls morally weak women on the list, they might be tempted to use their time not ministering to others but rather going around to the homes of friends and church members engaging in idle gossip and "saying what they should not." Rather than taking care of God's business, or even her own business, such a woman would be getting into everyone else's business. Such a woman cannot be placed on a list intended only for wise, faithful women who are walking with Christ and helping others to do the same.

<span id="page-433-4"></span><span id="page-433-2"></span><span id="page-433-1"></span><span id="page-433-0"></span>5:14–15 Just as "childbearing" probably stands for all of a wife's duties in the home in 2:15, so to "bear children" and "manage their households" probably stand for the same here in verse 14 (cf. comment on 2:15). In this way, younger widows should pursue marriage and all of the duties it entails. This is not unlike Paul's fuller expression of wifely duties in Titus 2:4–5: "Train the young women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled." In fulfilling these duties, a younger woman removes herself from the temptations of the idler and the busybody and thereby gives no legitimate grounds for anyone to speak ill of her (either an "adversary" or perhaps by *the*  "adversary," the Devil).

<span id="page-433-3"></span>5:16 Paul concludes with a summary of the foregoing. A family should care for its own widowed mothers and grandmothers. This is to relieve the church of the burden of providing support in cases in which alternate means of support are available. The church has limited funds, and what it has should be reserved for those who are "truly widows" (i.e., those who have no other recourse but the church).

### *Response*

Our culture idolizes youth. Women in particular are tempted to believe the lie that their opportunity for making an impact is when they are young, vigorous, and pretty. But this text says that older women have an opportunity for ministry that others may not have. Moreover, only those who have proven character can be enrolled on the ministry list. Women can pursue tasks now that will qualify them for such ministry when they reach the appropriate age.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-434-2"></span><span id="page-434-1"></span>In the first two verses of chapter 5, Paul explained to Timothy how he should relate to different groups within the congregation: older men, younger men, older women, and younger women (vv. 1–2). In verses 3–16, Paul focused in particular on the church's obligation to older widows. In verses 17–25, Paul turns his attention to older, mature men who are elders in the church. His aim is to explain to Timothy and the whole Ephesian congregation how to compensate an elder, how to discipline an elder, and how to ordain an elder.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-434-3"></span>5:17 This is the third time the term "elder" has appeared in 1 Timothy. The first two occurrences were in verses 1–2 of this chapter, as Paul referred to older men and women. But this passage specifies a group of mature men whose regular work includes the preaching and teaching of the Word of God: the elders.

<span id="page-435-1"></span>In the comments on 3:1–7, we observed that the NT uses three different terms to refer to the one office of leadership in the church: pastor, overseer, and elder. So what follows pertains to the office of pastor.

The "elders who rule [or care for the flock] well" are worthy of "double honor." "Double honor" could rightly be translated *twofold honor*, meaning that there are two ways in which a church should honor a faithful elder. The first is in the sense of giving the elder reverence and respect. The second is in the sense of an honorarium. Just as honoring widows in verse 3 meant providing for them financially, so also honor in verse 17 means providing for elders financially. Thus the church must give these elders both respect and monetary remuneration.48

<span id="page-435-3"></span>Does this mean that all elders must be in the paid employ of the church? The answer to that question appears to be no, because Paul explains which elders should be paid: "especially those who labor in preaching and teaching." Some have taken this last phrase as evidence that the church should have two separate classes of elders: ruling elders and preaching elders. Churches that recognize two classes of elders usually have ruling elders who focus on leading the church (manager-types, laymen) and others who focus on teaching the church (preachers in the paid employ of the church).

<span id="page-435-2"></span>But this text is not teaching two separate classes of elders—teaching and ruling. The key to seeing this is in that little word translated "especially." The Greek term is *malista*, and it often does mean "especially." But in the Pastoral Epistles, some argue that Paul uses the term to mean something like "that is" or "in particular" or "namely" (cf. comment on 4:10). So I hold that the sense is something like this: "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, in particular I mean those who labor in preaching and teaching." Two different groups of elders are not in view here. Rather, the "elders who rule well" are "those who labor in preaching in teaching." They are one and the same group.

This means that the aim of all elders should be to "rule well." And "ruling well" means "teaching and preaching" well. This is the job not of a select group of elders but of all elders. Any pastor who fails to learn the Word, communicate the Word, and apply the Word will not be worthy of double honor. This means also that congregations must respect their elders in part by paying them for their labors.

<span id="page-435-4"></span><span id="page-435-0"></span>5:18 Paul explains why a church must give honor to its pastor: "For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,' and, 'The laborer deserves his wages.'" The first half of the verse is a quotation from Deuteronomy 25:4: "You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain." In the ancient world, threshing was the process by which the grain in wheat was separated from its husk. Often oxen were used to walk over the wheat stalks in order to crush and separate them. The law of Moses stipulated that Israel was to allow the oxen to eat from the grain they were threshing. The logic is simple:

<sup>48</sup> Mounce, *Pastoral Epistles*, 306; Köstenberger, *Commentary on 1–2 Timothy and Titus*, 173.

1 Timothy 5:17–25 436

<span id="page-436-4"></span>just as an ox is allowed to acquire sustenance from his labors, so also is a pastor (cf. 1 Cor. 9:8–12).

<span id="page-436-3"></span>"The laborer deserves his wages" is a quote not from the OT but from Jesus himself. When Jesus sends out seventy-two disciples to minister from town to town, he tells them to stay in the homes of those who receive their message and to eat and drink "what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages" (Luke 10:7). Paul writes, "For the Scripture says" and then quotes the OT and Jesus as if they possess equal authority. On the authority of Jesus and on the authority of God's Word, Paul contends that God's people are to compensate elders who labor at preaching and teaching. This shows that Paul regards Jesus' words to have the same authority as Scripture.

<span id="page-436-2"></span>5:19–20 Paul next offers guidance to Timothy about how to receive an accusation against an elder. When someone alleges sin on the part of an elder, such accusations must be dealt with properly. Paul's process for dealing with elders accused of a sin accords with what Jesus requires to be done for any brother accused of sin. In Matthew 18:15–20, Jesus states that if a brother sins against another brother, the offended brother should confront the offender in private. If the offender does not repent, then the offended brother must initiate another confrontation and take along two or three witnesses to establish the charges made against the sinning brother. If they establish the charges and yet he still refuses to turn from his sin, the matter must come before the church. If the offender refuses to repent after it is brought to the church, he must be excommunicated.

<span id="page-436-5"></span>This is the same process in play for elders in 1 Timothy 5:19–20, except that this text picks up with the second step—establishing charges in the presence of witnesses. If the sinning pastor is unresponsive to that confrontation ("those who persist in sin"), then the matter goes before the church for a public rebuke and call to repentance as in Matthew 18.

<span id="page-436-1"></span>This process is formulated to establish guilt and to prevent false accusations. It is a serious sin to bear false witness against a fellow church member. And it is no less scandalous to bring false accusations against an elder. Unfounded, scurrilous accusations are not to be entertained or spread within the church.

<span id="page-436-6"></span><span id="page-436-0"></span>5:20–21 Paul adds gravity to his command by invoking the presence of the inhabitants of heaven: "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you." The procedures for disciplining an elder must be scrupulously followed. Not "prejudging" means that no one should presume someone's guilt just because they are accused. Nor should one presume innocence having heard only one side of a story. Neither the witnesses nor the church are allowed to predetermine guilt or innocence before the facts are received and considered (cf. Prov. 18:17). Keeping these rules without "partiality" means that the church must enforce these standards no matter who are the accused or the accusers. Everything must be done fairly, consistently, and in order.

<span id="page-437-5"></span><span id="page-437-4"></span><span id="page-437-3"></span><span id="page-437-1"></span>5:22 The "laying on of hands" is a reference to a church's setting aside a person for a task or ministry within the congregation (cf. 1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6). The force of the command requires the church not to make anyone an elder who is not qualified. The elder qualifications have already been discussed in 3:1–7, but knowing those qualifications and confirming that someone meets them are two different things. The list of qualifications can be learned in short order; the confirmation of such character takes time. This is why an elder must not be a "recent convert" (3:6); he must have a proven track record of faithfulness. If a man is made an elder too quickly and then commits grievous sin as an elder, those who recognized him as an elder share in the shame insofar as they overlooked character flaws they should have noticed. This seems to be what it means to "take part in the sins of others." Elders and congregations must be vigilant about whom they ordain. Thus Paul says, "Keep yourself pure." Timothy cannot get bogged down by someone else's sin because of not being vigilant when appointing elders.

<span id="page-437-6"></span><span id="page-437-2"></span><span id="page-437-0"></span>5:23 It is tempting to view as a digression Paul's remarks here about the use of water and wine. Such an approach to the passage, however, is probably incorrect. Paul just told Timothy to keep himself pure—to keep himself in line with the qualifications for elders listed in chapter 3, which include the phrase "not a drunkard" (3:3). Perhaps Paul knew of Timothy's resolve to keep himself pure with respect to alcohol. He may also have known that Timothy was drinking only water. Paul seems to be saying that Timothy does not need to abstain completely from alcohol but should make medicinal use of alcohol because of stomach ailments. He does not tell Timothy to give up his teetotaling ways. He does not rebuke him for taking an extraordinary stand for sobriety. He simply says that the extraordinary measure must not be made into a law that would prevent him from treatments that may help him when ill.49 This reading allows verse 23 to fit within the flow of thought as an exhortation related to Timothy's overall efforts to be pure. The following two verses return to the theme of not being hasty in the laying on of hands.

<span id="page-437-7"></span>5:24 The sinfulness of some elder candidates is plain to see well before such men are exposed at the final judgment. Some men's immaturity and sinfulness can be spotted from a mile away, and so the church should never even think about laying hands on that type of person. However, other elder candidates are good at concealing their sins. This does not absolve the church, however, from the responsibility of seeking to keep such men from the eldership, nor from disciplining such men when their sinfulness later asserts itself.

<span id="page-437-8"></span>5:25 A man's good character will shine through. Even if a good man's way is quiet and unnoticed, his character cannot remain hidden upon examination. The church will eventually see evidence if he is a man of good character. The church

<sup>49</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 240.

must give enough time to confirm the presence of such good works in an elder candidate's life.

### *Response*

Neither a pastor nor a congregation should accept frivolous, unsubstantiated charges against an elder (or against any member, for that matter). If the charges cannot be established by witnesses, they should be kept private. This does not mean that a victim must remain quiet if he or she is sinned against but no witnesses are present. The witnesses Paul mentions are witnesses not to the offense but to the confrontation after the fact. They can help establish whether the charges have merit. Believers must protect each other from baseless charges and petty gossip while providing a way for legitimate accusations to be heard and to go forward.

What about the man who looks good at church, who appears happy and affable, and who seems to have a commitment to sound doctrine? His wife is sort of quiet, but she is friendly when you talk to her, even if a little sad at times. With a guy like that, everything may be fine. Or it may be that he has learned to put on a good front at church, while at home he is angry and explosive. The church needs time for a man's true colors to be seen. There must be enough time to establish a track record of faithfulness before appointing him as an elder.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-438-1"></span>The theme of "honor" links the first two verses of chapter 6 to chapter 5. These first two verses appear at the end of a section in which Paul has spoken of the obligation to honor certain groups of people. In the first part of chapter 5, Paul writes of how the church should honor widows who are "truly widows." In the last half of chapter 5, he instructs the church concerning how certain elders are worthy of double honor. And here, in 6:1–2, Paul explains how slaves have an obligation to honor their masters. But the honor Paul refers to here does not involve money (as in the former two examples). The honor is shown instead in the slaves' respecting authority.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-439-1"></span>6:1 Paul issues his command to "bondservants" who are "under a yoke" and have "masters." The word translated "bondservants" is the Greek term *doulos*, the standard term for slaves used throughout the NT. These particular slaves are "under a yoke." A literal yoke is a "frame used to control working animals" (BDAG, s.v. ζυγός). The word appears here and elsewhere to describe the condition of slaves in the Roman world. Such slaves were the property of their masters and were required to do whatever their masters told them to do. If they failed to do their master's bidding, the master could use coercive violence to compel them to do the task at hand. In Roman slavery, a master had the power of life and death over his slave. The master could take his slave's life if he so desired because his slave was his property to do with as he pleased.

At first glance, Paul's words may appear to be an endorsement of human slavery, but they are not (cf. excursus below). Elsewhere, he states that slaves should pursue their own freedom if at all possible, and he also forbids free Christians from becoming slaves (1 Cor. 7:21–23). In this way, Paul seems to suggest that slavery is a sinful institution to be avoided.

<span id="page-439-2"></span><span id="page-439-0"></span>But in 1 Timothy 6:1–2, Paul is not making a statement about systemic injustices and social inequality. Nor is he intending to offer a moral evaluation of the institution of slavery. Rather, he is instructing Christian slaves about how they are to follow Christ in the situation in which they find themselves. Faithfulness to Christ does not require slaves to mount an armed rebellion against their oppressors, nor does it require them to pursue a massive reformation of the institution of slavery. These kinds of opportunities were not available to slaves in the Greco-Roman world, and modern readers need to be careful not to read their own democratic expectations into the strictures of a first-century slave's life. Paul seeks to spell out for the slaves in the congregation how they may remain faithful to Christ in a very difficult situation.

Paul directs his command to slaves, those who are "under a yoke." They must "honor" their masters. Commentators such as George Knight are correct to contend that "under a yoke" indicates an oppressive situation, one in which a slave is treated as little more than an ox with a yoke about his neck.50 Such language implies that Paul means to address slaves serving non-Christian masters in verse 1.

These servants are to regard their masters as worthy of all honor. Paul does not say that such masters *are* worthy of all honor, only that the servant must treat this authority in his life *as if* he were. Thus Christians who find themselves with an unbelieving authority over them are to serve that authority with respect. They are not allowed to disrespect or mistreat the authorities in their lives merely because they do not like them or because the masters do not believe as Christians do. On the contrary, Christians must honor unbelieving authorities precisely because Christians seek to persuade those authorities to believe the gospel.

<span id="page-440-1"></span>This does not mean that a slave must obey everything that human authorities tell them to do. As Paul makes clear elsewhere, human authorities are not ultimate (Rom. 13:1–2)—only God is. If a human authority instructs a Christian to do what God forbids, or forbids a Christian from doing what God commands, the Christian must defy that authority, as Peter and the other apostles did when they said, "We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

<span id="page-440-0"></span>But when it is possible to follow human authority without breaking God's law, Christians are to do all they can to honor that person's position, "so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled." The "name of God" is his reputation; the "teaching" is the gospel. These Christian slaves must not give any occasion for unbelievers to disrespect God or ignore his gospel. When a slave renders difficult obedience, he presents a powerful testimony that can serve as a compelling witness to his master. He images forth the very suffering that Christ himself underwent (1 Pet. 2:18–21).

<span id="page-440-7"></span><span id="page-440-5"></span>6:2a Verse 2a reflects the social upheavals that the gospel was causing in the lives of the Ephesian believers. The gospel had transformed the lives of both slaves and masters, and now they were finding themselves worshiping together in the church. How were they supposed to relate to one another? Christian masters are not addressed in this text, but Paul does address them elsewhere (e.g., Ephesians 6; Colossians 4). This omission in the current text might suggest that Paul is concerned with a particular problem occurring at Ephesus among some of the believing slaves.

<span id="page-440-4"></span><span id="page-440-2"></span>The problem may be implied by Paul's command "not [to] be disrespectful on the ground that they are brothers." Perhaps some of these slaves were having difficulty continuing in their duties when their masters were believers. Perhaps they thought their brotherhood in Christ should overturn their obligation to their masters. As indicated in the excursus below, Christianity necessarily undermines the norms of Greco-Roman slavery. The gospel does not allow Christian masters to threaten or abuse their slaves (Eph. 6:9; Col. 4:1). On the contrary, the gospel requires masters to treat their slaves as brothers (Philem. 16).

<span id="page-440-6"></span><span id="page-440-3"></span>In this way, Christianity radically undermined the unjust and oppressive features of Greco-Roman slavery. With coercive violence removed from the relationship, it might have been tempting for Christian slaves to lose their motivation for hard work. Yet serving a believer is not a cause for doing shoddy work but is a reason to work all the more diligently.

### *Response*

Ultimately, Christian workers are not seeking to please their boss; they are seeking to please the Lord. So they can be faithful even if the boss is not. This does not mean that they must stay in the job. If they have options, they may pursue those options. But for as long as they are working for the unbelieving boss, they must not respond to their boss's sin in a sinful way. Christian workers must turn their situation into an occasion for living the kind of righteous suffering that Jesus modeled for us.

### *Excursus: The Bible and Slavery*

Some people read this text and believe that because Paul tells slaves to honor their masters, he must be endorsing slavery. But is this view correct? The answer is *no*, for several reasons.

### 1. TELLING SOMEONE TO SUBMIT TO AN AUTHORITY DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE AUTHORITY IS MORALLY APPROVED.

<span id="page-441-3"></span><span id="page-441-2"></span>God told the Israelites to seek the good of the city while they lived under the authority of Babylon, as all the while God planned to destroy Babylon for its wickedness. Peter tells wives to submit to a husband's authority, even those who "do not obey the word" (1 Pet. 3:1–2). He also instructs Christians to submit to governing authorities, even if those authorities are persecuting them (1 Peter 2). God condemns any exercise of authority that is contrary to his holy will. And there were many elements of both Roman slavery and American slavery that were against God's law. Treating persons as property without recognizing their dignity as image-bearers of Almighty God is sinful and is condemned everywhere in the Bible. And yet that feature was endemic to both Roman and American slavery. So telling someone to submit to an authority cannot automatically be an endorsement of the one wielding that authority.

### 2. THE BIBLE OFTEN CONDEMNS THE MEANS BY WHICH SLAVES WERE TAKEN AS SLAVES.

In the first century, slavery was not race-based, as it was in the American South. People were taken as slaves through a number of means, including warfare, piracy, highway robbery, infant exposure, and punishment of criminals. In all of this, the issue of kidnapping persons in order to enslave them was always prevalent. What does the Bible say about kidnapping?

<span id="page-441-1"></span><span id="page-441-0"></span>In 1 Timothy 1:10, the apostle Paul says that kidnapping or manstealing is against God's law. Most interpreters recognize that this manstealing was for the purpose of slavery. This is why the ESV translates the relevant term as "enslavers" (cf. ESV mg.). The background for Paul's command is the OT law, which states, "Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death" (Ex. 21:16). Who is to be put to death? The one who takes the man *and* the one who holds him. This is significant, for some have made the case that while the Bible does condemn slave trading, it does not condemn *slave* 

#### 1 Timothy 6:1–2a 442

*holding*. 51 If this view were correct, there would not necessarily have been any moral problem with Christians owning slaves in the American South before and during the Civil War.

<span id="page-442-2"></span><span id="page-442-0"></span>But Exodus 21:16 says that both the *kidnapping* and the *enslavement* are punishable by death. And this is the background for Paul's own thinking about the matter in 1 Timothy. The entire system of Southern slavery was based on kidnapping persons from Africa. The slave-traders stuffed these Africans into ship holds, where they suffered and died by the thousands. That slave trade was an abomination. And it is fallacious to suggest that the slaveholders were not morally implicated in the slave trade. One cannot defend those who participated in the slave trade, nor can one defend those slave owners who created the market for manstealing.

So the Bible definitely condemns the means by which slaves were taken as slaves—especially kidnapping, which was punishable by death.

### 3. THE NT FORBIDS CHRISTIANS FROM USING

#### COERCIVE VIOLENCE AGAINST SLAVES.

<span id="page-442-1"></span>Ephesians 6:9 states, "Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him." At the very least, this text confirms that there were Christian slave owners in NT times. Yet Paul says that the slave owners were not allowed to threaten their slaves with violence. And obviously, if they were not allowed to threaten with violence, they were not allowed to do violence against their slaves. It may have been permissible under Roman law for a master to abuse or even kill his slave, but it was not permissible under God's law to do such things. Some might call that slavery in some sense, but what kind of slavery is it that does not allow the master to coerce his slave through violence? It is certainly not Roman slavery. Nor is it like slavery in the American South. This is something so different one wonders if it can be called slavery at all.

### 4. THE NT COMMANDS CHRISTIANS TO TREAT SLAVES LIKE BROTHERS.

When Paul writes to the slave owner Philemon about his runaway slave Onesimus, he tells him to receive Onesimus "no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother. . . . If you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me" (Philem. 16–17).

<span id="page-442-3"></span>What kind of slavery is it that tells a master to give up threatening and to treat his slave like his brother? Again, this is not Roman slavery, or slavery as in the American South. So the Bible does not endorse either of those types of slavery. This is something else entirely. And this is why slavery cannot continue where the kingdom of God holds sway. The Bible completely undermines all of the defining features of slavery: kidnapping, coercive violence, and the treatment of people as property rather as brothers created in the image of God.

<sup>51</sup> Douglas Wilson, *Black and Tan: A Collection of Essays and Excursions on Slavery, Culture War, and Scripture in America* (Moscow, ID: Canon Press, 2005), 56.

<span id="page-443-0"></span>5. THE BIBLE ENCOURAGES SLAVES TO GET OUT OF SLAVERY IF THEY CAN. First Corinthians 7:21 says, "Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.)" If the Bible were endorsing slavery, it would not tell slaves to take opportunities to become free. Yet that is exactly what Paul does.

### 6. THE BIBLE FORBIDS CHRISTIANS FROM VOLUNTARILY

### ENTERING INTO SLAVERY.

<span id="page-443-1"></span>First Corinthians 7:23 states, "You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men." This command could not be clearer. If the Bible were endorsing slavery, it would not forbid Christians from becoming slaves.

### 7. THE BIBLE CONDEMNS RACISM.

As mentioned above, slavery in the NT was not race-based. But slavery in the American South was. The Bible forbids treating others as less than human because of their race. God created humans in his own image—all humans—not just white or black or any other racial group. Because of that, every person—not just some people—has inherent dignity and worth as an image-bearer of Almighty God. For this reason, the diversity of races is not an evil to be abolished but a glory to be celebrated. God intends to gather worshipers for himself from every "tribe and language and people and nation" (Rev. 5:9). And we know that in Christ "there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all" (Col. 3:11).

<span id="page-443-4"></span><span id="page-443-2"></span>In conclusion, the Bible does not endorse slavery nor the evils inherent in slavery. On the contrary, it abolishes them in the name of Jesus. Although the gospel of Jesus Christ does not command us to take up arms in violent revolution to abolish slavery, it does introduce a new kingdom into the world that will one day overthrow all unjust authorities. And we are called as the church to be an outpost of that coming kingdom. Wherever the church goes, slavery must flee, because the kingdom of Christ will not abide unjust authorities.

<span id="page-443-3"></span>When the critics assail Scripture, they often make confident assertions about things about which they know very little (1 Tim. 1:7). In this case, when they rail against the Bible's alleged endorsement of slavery, they are misrepresenting what the Bible actually teaches.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-444-3"></span>In chapter 1, Paul issued his initial warning against false teachers. He returned to that confrontation in chapter 4. And now he confronts the false teachers again in chapter 6. But in this passage, Paul begins to explain the motivations of the false teachers in the Ephesian church. He explains that the source of the false teachers' conduct is a matter of the heart.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-444-4"></span><span id="page-444-2"></span>6:2b The phrase "teach and urge these things" marks a transition from one topic to another. But what are "these things" that Timothy is supposed to "teach and urge"? A nearly identical command appears in 4:11, where "these things" refers clearly to what came before, and this is most likely the case here in 6:2b as well. Timothy is to teach and urge his congregation to believe and obey all that Paul has written up to this point. He is not only to teach but also to *urge*—Timothy is not merely to dole out information in his sermons. He is supposed to command people what to believe and do based on Paul's apostolic instruction. His preaching must be in the imperative mood.

<span id="page-445-2"></span>6:3 The "if" clause is assumed to be true for the sake of argument.52 As a rhetorical device, this statement does not establish the actual presence of false teachers in Ephesus. However, the presence of the false teachers has already been established by Paul's previous references to them: from the beginning of the letter, Paul has confirmed that the church has been infiltrated by those who teach a "different doctrine" (cf. 1:3).

<span id="page-445-1"></span>Their doctrine is different in that it departs from the "sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ" and from "the teaching that accords with godliness." "Sound" renders a Greek word that denotes health, with the figurative extension that indicates freedom from error. In that sense, sound words are healthy words. These words contrast with the "*unhealthy* craving for controversy" that appears in the following verse.

This healthy kind of teaching has its basis in what Jesus Christ himself taught and practiced and what he revealed to his apostles through the Spirit. Paul believed—rightly—that the Spirit of Christ was speaking through him as an apostle (2 Cor. 13:3). So "different doctrine" is a departure from the standard of Christ's own teaching as now communicated by the apostle.

<span id="page-445-0"></span>But "different doctrine" also refers to that which differs from the "teaching that accords with godliness." In other words, it is that which differs from the teaching that *produces* godliness. False teaching produces worldliness, but sound teaching produces godliness, as Paul has in mind here. In this way, he makes clear the shortcomings of the false teaching: it does not comport with Jesus' words and does not produce godliness.

<span id="page-445-4"></span><span id="page-445-3"></span>6:4–5 This verse is the apodosis of a conditional sentence begun in verse 3. The argument from verse 3 to verse 4 goes like this: If there are any false teachers trying to deceive the flock in Ephesus (and there are), then you should know what motivates their error. Verse 4 indicates that their error is due to deficiencies not of information but of *character*.

The primary character flaw is that the false teacher is marked by "conceit." This term is from a noun that denotes an illusion. When applied to a person, it refers to illusions about oneself in the sense of "affectation, vanity, conceit."53 The conceited person is deceived in his views because he is deceived about himself; he regards himself and his own opinions more highly than he ought. In the Greek, all of the character deficiencies that follow result from the fact that the false teacher is conceited.

"Understands nothing" translates a participle dependent on "puffed up with conceit." The sense is most likely one of result: "he is conceited *with the result that*  he understands nothing."

<sup>52</sup> Daniel B. Wallace, *Greek Grammar beyond the Basics* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1997), 690.

<sup>53</sup> *Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek* (Leiden: Brill, 2015), 2170.

A second result of the false teacher's conceit is that "he has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words." "Unhealthy craving" translates a term that means to be ill or infected with disease. Its figurative use (as here) means "to be troubled or tormented in mind." In this sense it refers to "hav[ing] a morbid craving" for something.54 This sickness of mind is in contrast to the healthy words of Christ mentioned in verse 3. The false teacher's conceit, therefore, leads him away from that which would bring life and healing and toward that which brings spiritual sickness and death.

<span id="page-446-2"></span><span id="page-446-0"></span>The false teacher craves "for controversy and for quarrels about words." Their craving for controversy means they enjoy verbal fisticuffs. Moreover, they crave for "quarrels about words"—literally "word-war" (Gk. *logomachias*). A comparison with a related term in 2 Timothy 2:14 reveals that "word-war" is not mere hair-splitting about this or that theological nuance—it is not a quibble over semantics. "Wordwar" seems specifically to indicate war against the Word of truth, and this is what the false teacher craves. He not only wants to fight; he wants to fight against the revealed Word of God (cf. comment on 2 Tim. 2:14).

The false teacher's craving for "word-war" produces division within the church; in particular, "envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction." The false teachers relish division; they lash out with their words and say nasty things about people. And, in the midst of it all, they bear "evil suspicions," or "speculations." They are constantly introducing new conjectures and opinions to God's people with no basis in Scripture. As a result, they produce "constant friction" in and among people who are "depraved in mind and deprived of the truth." Thus the minds of the "word-warriors" are morally corrupted and, as a result, become devoid of truth. Those whose minds become so corrupted will be "imagining that godliness is a means of gain." The false teachers do what they do in order to enrich themselves.

The false teachers peddle error not because they lack information but because they lack heart. They do not want what God wants, and their teaching reflects that sad reality.

<span id="page-446-1"></span>6:6–8 The false teachers treat "godliness" as a means of material "gain." Godliness is in fact a means to "great gain," but not the kind of gain the false teachers crave. Spiritual gain follows whenever real godliness is joined with contentment, with satisfaction with what God has given. If God has given little, contentment is satisfied with and thankful for that little bit. If God has given wealth, contentment is satisfied with and thankful for that wealth. This kind of contentment is a means of great gain because its satisfaction is based not on the gifts but on the Giver. It is not constantly and insatiably seeking for more. It understands that man brings nothing into this world and can take nothing out. Therefore, believers should not act as if material possessions were the key to the good life, because they are not. The good life is in godly contentment, not in the acquisition of more possessions and wealth.

<span id="page-447-0"></span>6:9–10 The desire for riches results in temptation toward evil. This desire is a "snare" because it traps the greedy by their own desires. Once the desires are enacted in deeds, they result in "ruin and destruction." This is why Paul warns not against the use of money but against the illicit and idolatrous desire for it. Money itself is not the root of all kinds of evils. Nor is the use of money. Rather, it is the *love* of money that brings forth countless kinds of evil in a person's life. And so Paul warns that "this craving" for money can lead someone to "wander" away from the faith.

### *Response*

People defy God ultimately not because they lack information as to what they ought to do. They sin because they lack the *heart* to do what they ought to do. They would rather have more possessions or independence or power than God. Wherever our treasure is, there our hearts will be also. Thus we must wage war against sin at the level of our hearts.

<span id="page-447-1"></span>It is sometimes alleged that a concern for truth is divisive. Paul disagrees. When the truth is lifted up, God's people rally to it. When error is lifted up, it causes dissension in the ranks, as some are confused, bewitched, and led astray. The blame for division in a church goes to those teaching error, not to those faithfully teaching the truth.

### 1 TIMOTHY 6:11–21

**<sup>11</sup>**But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. **12**Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. **<sup>13</sup>** I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before*<sup>1</sup>* Pontius Pilate made the good confession, **<sup>14</sup>** to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, **15**which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, **16**who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

**<sup>17</sup>**As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. **18**They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, **<sup>19</sup>** thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-448-1"></span><span id="page-448-0"></span>In 1 Timothy, Paul has explained to Timothy how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is a pillar and foundation of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15). He has given instructions to Timothy about opposing false teachers, about qualifications for elders and deacons, and about how to treat different kinds of people in the church. In this final chapter, Paul has circled back to the confrontation of false teachers (6:2–10). In this final passage, Paul explains what is required of the "man of God" and what is required of the wealthy. Paul issues Timothy a final exhortation to "guard" the true teaching against false teaching. The letter concludes with a blessing.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-448-2"></span>6:11 Paul addresses his command to the "man of God," which refers to Timothy specifically but applies also to everyone in the congregation, as Timothy is to be an example among those who believe. Paul's exhortation is for Timothy to "flee these things," referring to the vices of the false teachers outlined in the previous paragraph: their conceit, greediness, desire to be rich, love of money, and wandering away from the faith. Paul tells Timothy to "flee"—which has the idea of seeking safety through flight (BDAG). The best way to be free is to flee.

Fleeing from evil, however, is of little value if it is not accompanied by an active pursuit of the good. So Paul tells Timothy to "pursue" six character qualities: righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, and gentleness.

"Righteousness" refers to "conduct that is in accord with God's will and pleasing to him."55 "Godliness" is closely related to righteousness. It denotes the "duty that man owes to God," perhaps even "piety."56 "Faith" refers to trust in God, not to faithfulness. "Love" refers to the affection for one another that the Spirit of

<sup>55</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 261.

<sup>56</sup> Ibid.

<span id="page-449-5"></span>Christ works in his disciples (cf. John 13:35). "Steadfastness" refers to the attitude of patience and trust that a person has when bearing up under unjust treatment. This attitude is one of faith and confidence in the final outcome that God has ordained.57 "Gentleness" is the opposite of an overbearing attitude.

<span id="page-449-7"></span>6:12 Believing in Christ is a fight. It is a bona fide struggle. There will be many trials that will tempt the "man of God" to abandon faith in Christ. But the man of God must fight to maintain his faith. It will be a lifelong struggle, but at the end, the man of God will have the opportunity to take hold of immortality. So this is a call to persevere to the end. The "good confession" is Timothy's confession of Christ that he made either at his baptism or at his ordination, a "public acknowledgement of Jesus (Mt. 10:32; Lk. 12:8) as the resurrected Lord (Rom. 10:9–10)."58

<span id="page-449-8"></span><span id="page-449-3"></span><span id="page-449-2"></span><span id="page-449-1"></span>6:13 Paul's making his charge in the presence of the creator God and the presence of Christ adds solemnity and gravity to his command. It also reminds Timothy that his "good confession" is nothing other than what Jesus himself declared in "his affirmative answer to Pilate's question 'Are you the king of the Jews?' (Mt. 27:11; Mk. 15:2; Lk. 23:3; John 18:33–37)."59 Jesus gave an affirmative answer to a question that he knew would cost him. Nevertheless, he was faithful to bear witness. Timothy must do likewise.

<span id="page-449-9"></span>6:14–16 Paul orders Timothy to "keep the commandment." Most likely Paul speaks of the Christian faith itself as a kind of command—a "body of ethical teaching."60 So to keep the commandment is to guard or keep the apostolic deposit entrusted to him.

At the mention of the "appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ," Paul digresses into expressions of exultation in the person and work of God through Christ. When Christ appears at his second advent, it will be according to the sovereign plan of God who controls the timing of all the events of the end times. God is the unrivaled, sovereign, conquering King "who alone has immortality" and thus is the source of resurrection life and the final judge. He has appointed his Son to preside over the final resurrection of the just and the unjust (John 5:27–29). In keeping with OT themes, Paul says that God dwells "in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see" (cf. Ex. 33:20). To this God, Paul offers an exultant doxology: "To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen."

<span id="page-449-10"></span><span id="page-449-6"></span><span id="page-449-4"></span><span id="page-449-0"></span>6:17 Paul next instructs Timothy concerning the "rich in this present age." Such people are already wealthy and are a part of the congregation. They contrast with those in verse 9 who are seeking to get rich for all the wrong reasons. Those in verse 9 fall into temptation, ruin, and destruction because they do not really love God. They love money, and it is impossible to love both God and money (Matt.

<sup>57</sup> Ibid., 262.

<sup>58</sup> Ibid., 264.

<sup>59</sup> Ibid., 266.

<sup>60</sup> Ibid., 267.

<span id="page-450-2"></span>6:24). In this verse, however, Paul acknowledges that it is possible to possess wealth in a God-honoring way. Again, Paul does not treat wealth as the problem; the problem is with the sinful attitudes that exploit and use wealth in the wrong way.

<span id="page-450-4"></span>He instructs the rich not to be "haughty." Such pride is the root of the vices displayed in the false teachers (cf. comment on 1 Tim. 6:4–5). Nor are they to put their "hopes" in the "uncertainty of riches." No one should expect riches to provide ultimate happiness or contentment. Riches are uncertain, and the security they provide is illusory (Prov. 18:11; 23:4–5).

<span id="page-450-0"></span>There is a temptation to believe that wealth will provide security and happiness. The wealthy must not think this way but rather must put their hope in the God who can provide those things *and* who provides the material wealth they currently enjoy. It is not a sin to enjoy God's gifts—it is only a sin to enjoy them more than the Giver.

<span id="page-450-5"></span>6:18–19 Paul warns not against the possession of wealth but against its misuse. He identifies several practices for the right use of wealth:

(1) Recognize the source of the wealth. God himself "richly provides us with everything to enjoy" (v. 17).

<span id="page-450-3"></span>(2) Recognize the goodness of wealth. The false teachers were the ones who rejected creational goods (cf. comments on 4:1–5). There is nothing inherently evil about material blessing.

(3) Recognize that God intends for his people to enjoy his gifts. There is nothing wrong with using and enjoying the material blessing God gives (cf. Eccles. 2:24–25).

<span id="page-450-1"></span>(4) Recognize the priority of using wealth to bless others. The wealthy "are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share." An unwillingness to be generous with others in need reveals to what extent idolatry has entered into a wealthy person's heart.

(5) Recognize where true wealth resides. Disciples of Jesus understand that it is not their possessions that make them happy.

<span id="page-450-6"></span>6:20–21 Timothy is to guard the "deposit," which is simply a word for "property entrusted to another" (BDAG, s.v. παραθήκη). In this case, the deposit Timothy guards is the Christian faith itself. A faithful steward must do two things with this faith: (1) pass on the message as is, and (2) protect the message from threats.

<span id="page-450-7"></span>Sometimes the man of God *preaches* the Word; other times the man of God *defends* the Word. Sometimes he exhorts with sound doctrine; other times he has to refute those who contradict (Titus 1:9). The man of God devotes himself to the Scriptures, and a "yes" to the Scriptures always means a "no" to rival authorities. Thus Timothy must "avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called 'knowledge.'" The faithful pastor must discipline his own heart to stay true to the faith once for all delivered to the saints and must not allow himself to be enticed by another message. A "yes" to rival authorities amounts to a "no" to God's authority. And a "no" to God's authority can only end in apostasy—or, in Paul's words, "swerv[ing] from the faith."

The letter ends where it began, with grace: "Grace be with you." If mercy is sinners' *not* getting what they deserve, then grace is sinners' getting what they plainly do *not* deserve. Paul ends by wishing this grace for his audience. The "you" is plural in Greek, which means that Paul's final benediction is a wish not merely for Timothy but for the entire church. It is also an indication that he intends this letter to be read before the entire congregation (cf. Col. 4:16; 1 Thess. 5:27). Paul desires the entire congregation to be sustained by the unmerited favor of God.

### <span id="page-451-2"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-451-3"></span><span id="page-451-1"></span><span id="page-451-0"></span>The list of virtues in verse 11 has some parallels with the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22–23: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. In Galatians, these character qualities reflect the work of the Spirit in believers. But 1 Timothy 6:11 calls believers actively to pursue these things. Which is it? Are these virtues something we are supposed to pursue or something the Spirit is supposed to be doing in us? Both are true. We are actively to pursue these virtues precisely because the Spirit is working in us to produce them (Phil. 2:12–13). God's work in us through the Spirit is not a call for passivity on our part; on the contrary, it is the basis for our pursuit of godliness. The two truths are not at odds.

1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus, **<sup>2</sup>**To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-456-0"></span>As in 1 Timothy, the first two verses of 2 Timothy constitute the opening greeting of the letter. In these kinds of first-century letters, the opening would typically consist of three parts: (1) reference to the sender, (2) reference to the recipient, and (3) a greeting. Paul uses this form throughout his letters, and 2 Timothy is no exception, although Paul has put his own spin on the form and adapted it for his own Christian purposes (table 7.1).

### TABLE 7.1: Paul's Three-Part Salutation in 2 Timothy 1:1–2

| Sender    | Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the<br>promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus, |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recipient | To Timothy, my beloved child:                                                                                        |

The opening contains material that is key to interpreting the rest of the book. Paul Christianizes a standard expression of greeting (*chairein*) by transforming it into "grace, mercy, *and* peace" (*charis*, *eleos*, and *eirēnē*).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-456-3"></span><span id="page-456-1"></span>1:1 The first word identifies Paul as the sender and author of the letter (cf. discussion of authorship in Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles: Author). As in other letters, Paul identifies himself and his office in order to reiterate his authority as an apostle (for more on the office of apostle, see comment on 1 Tim. 1:1).

Paul says that he is "an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God." Jesus charged Paul as an apostle in an expression of the singular divine will. Paul's authority is grounded in the purposes of God the Father, announced by the ministrations of Jesus, and empowered by the Holy Spirit (cf. 2 Tim. 1:7, 14). Trinitarian authority empowers Paul's ministry.

<span id="page-457-2"></span><span id="page-457-0"></span>The last phrase in verse 1 tells us the "object and intention"1 of Paul's apostleship: "according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus." The promise of life is God's promise to bring salvation and life through the Messiah Jesus (e.g., Gal. 3:16). Paul was to be an authoritative proclaimer of Christ's resurrection from the dead, which was and is the guarantee of our salvation. This "promise of . . . life" is all the more relevant to Paul's own situation as he himself faces death as he writes this letter (2 Tim. 4:6–8).

<span id="page-457-4"></span><span id="page-457-3"></span><span id="page-457-1"></span>1:2 Paul addresses this letter to Timothy (cf. comment on 1 Tim. 1:2). It is clear that Paul has a warm affection for Timothy—he asks Timothy to come to see him as soon as possible (2 Tim. 4:9). Calling Timothy "my beloved child," Paul the beat-up apostle uses a term of endearment as he issues one last set of instructions to his young protégé. Paul thus begins this letter with a declaration of his own authority and a word of tender concern for Timothy. The source of "grace, mercy, and peace" in verse 2 is the same as the source of Paul's apostleship in verse 1: "God the Father" and "Christ Jesus."

### *Response*

We need Paul to remind us of his authority because we are facing the very same things Timothy faced — challenges to God's authority. Paul will command Timothy to hold fast to the faithful Word in the face of false teachers who oppose it. He is telling us to do the same. But our willingness to do so will depend entirely upon whom we recognize as our authority. Before we are able to fight the good fight to which God is calling us, we must settle in our heart now the question of who or what will be our authority.

### <span id="page-458-3"></span>2 TIMOTHY 1:3–7

**<sup>3</sup>** I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. **4**As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy. **<sup>5</sup>** I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. **6**For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, **<sup>7</sup>** for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-458-5"></span><span id="page-458-2"></span>The thanksgiving in 2 Timothy 1:3 stands immediately prior the body of the letter. It is important to remember Paul's situation as he writes this letter. He writes from prison in Rome, where he knows he is soon to be executed (2 Tim. 4:6–7). Paul has been in many difficult situations before writing this letter, but he seems to indicate that this time is different. He knows that this may be the end. Paul writes to Timothy what may very well be his last words to him.

		- 2. An Apostle's Command (1:6–7)

### *Comment*

1:3 Verse 3 tells us to *whom* Paul directs his thankfulness. Verse 4 tells us *what* Paul longs for as he thanks God. And verse 5 tells us the *reason* he thanks God. So in these three verses Paul unfolds the *who*, the *what*, and the *why* of his thanksgiving.

<span id="page-458-6"></span><span id="page-458-1"></span><span id="page-458-0"></span>Paul thanks God, which is remarkable in itself given Paul's condition. In the ancient world, prisoners were not provided with basic necessities. They were often dependent on other people's kindness and help for the essentials—Paul later asks Timothy to "bring the cloak" (4:13). Yet, in this condition of confinement, deprivation, and abandonment, Paul still thanks God. He is doing what he told the Ephesians to do in Ephesians 5:20, where he said that being filled with the Holy Spirit means "giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (cf. Col. 3:17).

Paul refers to God as the one "whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience." Paul's prison cell does not constrain him from serving God in the most desperate of conditions. His friends may have deserted him, but God has not. Paul continues to serve God "with a clear conscience," walking faithfully before the Lord. He is not falling away from Christ because of being cast aside in a prison cell.

Paul is serving God "as did my ancestors" (lit., "from [my] ancestors"). He has received from his forefathers a pattern and example of faithfulness. This remarkable statement gives us a glimpse into the way Paul thinks about his Jewish forebears. He serves God just as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David did. Paul rightly believes that the gospel of Christ is the fulfillment of the promises made to his forefathers. What his forefathers trusted in anticipation, Paul now trusts in fulfillment. Christianity and Judaism—rightly understood—are not two different religions. They are two stages of one religion, with an unfolding revelation. The faith of the OT is what the seed is to the flower, what the foundation is to the building, what the boy is to the man.

<span id="page-459-2"></span>1:4 The *who* that Paul thanks is God. The *what* that he experiences while thanking God is to "long to see you, that I may be filled with joy." Paul's longing is made even more poignant by the fact that he remembers the last farewell, in which Timothy was so overcome with emotion that he wept for Paul ("as I remember your tears"). Readers can only imagine what the memory of those tears must mean to Paul as he languishes in prison. Demas, Crescens, and Titus have all moved on (4:10). Everyone has either deserted Paul or gone on to do something else (except for Luke; cf. 4:11), and yet Paul remembers one man who was not eager to leave him but who could part from him only in tears. The memory of Timothy's love and affection shines like a light in the shadows of Paul's wretched condition. For that reason, Paul wants to see this "beloved child" (1:2) once again.

<span id="page-459-5"></span><span id="page-459-4"></span><span id="page-459-3"></span><span id="page-459-1"></span>1:5 Paul next mentions the *why* of his thanksgiving: "I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well." Paul is thankful because he knows that Timothy's faith is authentic and real. It is a faith in Christ that has been tested by suffering and has been proved in faithfulness to Paul. But Paul also links the genuineness of Timothy's faith to the ones who taught it to him—his grandmother, Lois; and his mother, Eunice. It may be that Paul knows these women personally (Acts 16:1). In any case, he knows that they are the genuine article, and their testimony gives Paul confidence that Timothy is too. These women have not handed to Timothy a false gospel but have passed on the true one. They have handed on no hypocritical way of life but a real one. Paul is grateful to God for the integrity of faith that Timothy inherited from his mother and grandmother.

<span id="page-459-0"></span>In this way, Paul invites readers to ponder the singularly powerful impact that mothers and grandmothers can have on children. Timothy's father apparently was not a believer and had no Christian influence over his son (Acts 16:1). These women, however, have made their mark on Timothy. Even though the work of childrearing can be mundane and thankless, the seeds these women of God planted have grown into an oak of righteousness. The boy they raised has become the man that the great apostle Paul relies on in his most desperate hour.

<span id="page-460-2"></span>1:6 "For this reason" introduces the command Paul is about to give. Because he is so certain that Timothy's faith is genuine, he commands him to "fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands." The "gift of God" refers not merely to the gift of the Spirit received at salvation; it is a gift that Timothy received with the "laying on of . . . hands." This is the language of Timothy's ordination, mentioned also in 1 Timothy 4:14. It is no contradiction for Paul to mention "my hands" here while reminding Timothy of the role of all the elders in 1 Timothy 4:14. In 2 Timothy, Paul simply means to emphasize his own role in Timothy's ordination and launch into ministry.

<span id="page-460-1"></span><span id="page-460-0"></span>When elders lay hands on a man, they are not magically investing him with powers. Nor are they mechanically filling him with the Spirit. The laying on of hands is a public recognition of giftedness based on what the Holy Spirit has already done in an individual. In that sense, it is a church's commissioning of someone to the work of ministry (cf. Acts 6:6; 13:3). The norm for ordination, therefore, is not merely a self-realization concerning gospel ministry but a community-wide realization of a person's fitness for the work. The church's affirmation is essential for beginning the work, which is why Paul says that Timothy received the gift "through the laying on of my hands."

No person can give himself the gift of pastoring God's people, but he *can* allow his gifting to languish and atrophy. Timothy must not let this happen. On the contrary, he must "fan into flame the gift of God," which means that he must do that which he has already been gifted to do but can grow stronger in. The ministry of the Word is a like muscle that can either strengthen through frequent exertion or atrophy through neglect and disuse. Perhaps the potential neglect of Timothy's ministry has been due to fear and intimidation, which would explain what Paul says in verse 7.

<span id="page-460-3"></span>1:7 Paul grounds the command of verse 6: "For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control." The "spirit" Paul has in view here is the Holy Spirit, and that Spirit does not engender fear. Some translations render the phrase as "spirit of timidity," but that is misleading. The term translated "fear" indicates cowardice, which is not merely an experience of fear. Many people experience fear who are not cowards. A coward is one who lacks the courage to act against his fears in the face of opposition and danger. God has not given his people a spirit who meets opposition and danger and then slinks away. That certainly is not the kind of Spirit that Timothy has been given. For this reason, he is not to slink away from preaching the gospel when the going gets tough. God has supplied Timothy with ability through the Spirit to do what needs to be done. The Spirit causes love for God and neighbor to be the defining features of a disciple's character. The same

Spirit inspires self-control to overcome whatever must be surmounted in order to join the fight.

### *Response*

When gospel preaching meets opposition, often the temptation will be to back away from conflict. But Christians cannot do so, because they are not animated by that kind of spirit. This is true for all Christians in the work of evangelism, but especially for those with pastoral responsibilities. Preachers have to kindle afresh the gift, not cowering in fear but standing with the Word of truth in boldness and love.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-461-0"></span>This text should be read as the beginning of the "last words of Paul." Here at the very outset, Paul has called on Timothy to take up his quarrel with the foes of the faith who have infiltrated the church in Ephesus. He has also commanded Timothy to "fan into flame" his gifting (2 Tim. 1:6–7). Paul now exhorts Timothy

to have no shame in suffering together with Paul for the sake of the gospel (vv. 8–18).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-462-4"></span><span id="page-462-3"></span><span id="page-462-2"></span>1:8 The verse begins with a prohibition: "do not be ashamed." "Therefore" means that the command is grounded in what Paul has said in verse 7. Because God has given Timothy not a spirit of cowardice but a Spirit of power and discipline, Timothy must not be ashamed. Paul is concerned with the way in which shame can undermine faithfulness to Christ (note the word "ashamed" in verses 8, 12, and 16). The *American Heritage Dictionary* defines shame as "a painful emotion caused by the belief that one is, or is perceived by others to be, inferior or unworthy of affection or respect because of one's actions, thoughts, circumstances, or experiences." The Spirit of Almighty God will not coexist with that kind of shame but drives it out. Therefore, Timothy must not be ashamed.

<span id="page-462-0"></span>Paul suggests at least two reasons why Timothy might feel shame: (1) because of the gospel, "the testimony about our Lord," and (2) because of Paul, a "prisoner." In Paul's day, many people looked down on Christians for their message about Jesus. Skeptics shamed Paul at Mars Hill when he began to preach about the resurrection, proving that the gospel is indeed "folly to those who are perishing" (1 Cor. 1:18). Apart from grace, the world thinks Christians to be rubes for believing what they believe. Paul knows that there is plenty of shame for those who would believe and preach the gospel.

There is also plenty of shame to go around for those willing to identify with gospel preachers. We can imagine how the unsanctified mind would have regarded Paul, in prison for preaching the gospel. It would have appeared foolish to throw one's life away on a fairy tale about a dead Jew named Jesus. It would surely have been difficult to associate with a man so shamed for the name of Christ. To do so would be to invite such shame upon oneself.

<span id="page-462-1"></span>It is striking that Paul does not call himself a prisoner of *Rome*. Instead he calls himself a prisoner of the Lord. Paul regards his shame not as his own but as Christ's. He belongs to Jesus, not the Romans. If the Romans despise his message, it is because they despise his master, Jesus. Paul sees his sufferings as nothing other than the sufferings of Christ lived out again in Paul's own body (Gal. 2:20). Being ashamed of Paul the Lord's prisoner is tantamount to being ashamed of Jesus—the one for whom Paul is imprisoned. And so he tells Timothy not to be ashamed of him, the Lord's prisoner. On the contrary, he commands, "Share in suffering for

the gospel by the power of God." The proof that Timothy is not ashamed must be revealed in his willingness to suffer.

The stakes are high in this text—associating with the imprisoned apostle could be risky. In the following verses, therefore, Paul describes for Timothy all that has been accomplished by the "power of God."

<span id="page-463-4"></span>1:9 Many commentators regard verses 9–10 as an early Christian hymn or confession (e.g., NA28), but that conclusion is by no means certain (e.g., UBS5 ).2 What is certain is that Paul introduces these two verses in order to remind Timothy of what the power of God has accomplished, things that Timothy himself has already experienced. If the power of God is sufficient to save sinners as described in verses 9–10, then certainly the power of God will enable Timothy to suffer together with Paul.

<span id="page-463-5"></span><span id="page-463-2"></span><span id="page-463-0"></span>The clause at the beginning of verse 9 specifies God as the one who "saved us." Verse 10 defines this salvation as rescue from "death" and the giving of "life and immortality." God's salvation involves both rescue from death and the giving of eternal life (Rom. 6:23). God breaks through hard hearts by calling his people to himself. This "holy calling" is effectual in the sense that it infallibly summons forth a response of faith (cf. "calling" in Rom. 8:30; 9:11, 24; 1 Cor. 1:9; Gal. 1:6; Eph. 4:1). God "calls" sinners to himself not because they deserve it or because they request it—it is "not because of our works." By nature, sinners are dead in their trespasses and sins. They do not seek for God, but he certainly seeks them, "because of his own purpose and grace." Elsewhere, Paul links "calling" with God's predestining "purpose" of grace (Rom. 8:28); this predestining purpose is likely what Paul has in mind here as well (cf. Eph. 1:11).

<span id="page-463-7"></span><span id="page-463-3"></span><span id="page-463-1"></span>The implication is that salvation through Christ is not rooted ultimately in human effort or ingenuity but in the purposes of God from all eternity. In this way, salvation is all of grace. Paul specifies that God's grace has been given to his people "in Christ Jesus before the ages began" (cf. Titus 1:2). Before the world began—even before anyone ever sinned—God's predestining goodness was aimed squarely at sinners to save them.

<span id="page-463-6"></span>1:10 This verse begins with a clause further expounding the "grace" mentioned in verse 9; this grace has been "now . . . manifested" through the redemptive work of Christ. Because of Christ, God's grace is no mystery. Its manifestation means that it has "become public knowledge" (BDAG, s.v. *phaneroō*). God's gracious purposes are not the ephemeral musings of a distant deity. He puts flesh and blood on his plans to save his people "through the appearing," that is, the incarnation, "of our Savior Christ Jesus." That appearing achieved salvation through his cross and resurrection. Through the cross, the Savior "abolished death." This does not mean that sinners no longer experience death; rather, their death sentence will be upended by their subsequent resurrection. Jesus' resurrection amounted to

<sup>2</sup> Cf. William D. Mounce, *Pastoral Epistles*, WBC (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2016), 481.

the nullification of his own death. Likewise, his resurrection guarantees that the disciple's death will be nullified as well. This promise of "life and immortality" has been brought near to sinners through the message of the "gospel," which is being proclaimed in the world.

<span id="page-464-1"></span><span id="page-464-0"></span>1:11 "For which" looks back to the gospel mentioned at the end of verse 10. The Lord Jesus himself appeared to Paul and "appointed" him to be a "preacher and apostle and teacher." Each of these titles indicates that Paul's ministry was primarily to focus on the explication of the truth about Christ. As a "preacher," Paul proclaimed that message. As an "apostle," he was appointed by Jesus himself to be an inspired and authoritative bearer of that message. As a "teacher," Paul explained the meaning of God's revelation in Christ. In this sense, every aspect of Paul's ministry existed in order to set forth the gospel message, a message that brings "life and immortality" to all who believe in it.

<span id="page-464-2"></span>1:12 The first phrase of this verse links back to the "gospel" mentioned at the end of verse 10. A literal rendering might read, "on account of which [gospel] I suffer these things." "These things" refers to Paul's imprisonment mentioned in verse 8. As in verse 8, Paul says that he has been imprisoned for preaching the gospel. But even though he is in a shameful place (prison), Paul declares that he is not ashamed. Why? Because his confidence and trust are in Christ: "I know whom I have believed." Paul knows Christ, and so he has confidence in ultimate vindication. There is therefore no reason to be ashamed of his present circumstance.

Paul's confidence is not in his own ability to weather the storm. On the contrary, Paul writes, "I am convinced that *he* [God] is able." The power of God made Paul an apostle and preacher of the gospel, and that same power is now sustaining him in his misery. The very power of God is keeping Paul from being ashamed. He is confident that even if his captors take his freedom—or even his life—God is going to raise him up. This is what Paul means by saying that Christ can "guard" the life that has been "entrusted" to Paul. Paul knows that his life is not subject ultimately to the whims of his Roman captors; his life is hidden with Christ in God. Everything that he loses will be given back to him—and then some—on the last day (i.e., the day of resurrection).

<span id="page-464-5"></span><span id="page-464-4"></span><span id="page-464-3"></span>1:13–14 For Timothy, ministry without shame means being willing to associate with and suffer with Paul. But in these two verses, it also means being willing to stay faithful to Paul's message. Paul calls that message "the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me" (v. 13) and "the good deposit entrusted to you" (v. 14). In both of these expressions, Paul accents the *given-ness* of the gospel message. It has discernible content and contours. It is more of a bounded set than a centered one. One's teaching can either conform to the gospel "pattern" or depart from the same. One's teaching can be taken either from the "deposit" or from somewhere else. In short, Paul asserts an apostolic standard that must guide Timothy's teaching ministry.

Paul issues two directives vis-à-vis this apostolic standard. He commands Timothy to "follow" the apostolic standard and to "guard" it. The first command ("follow") could also be rendered as "hold fast" (Gk. *eche*). In this context, to "hold fast" means to commit oneself to a matter of "transcendent importance" (BDAG). In this case, the item of transcendent priority is the gospel message. Thus holding fast to the pattern of sound words indicates Timothy's pastoral duty to preach and to live the apostolic standard before God's people.

Paul is interested not merely in what Timothy says but also in how he lives it out. Holding fast to this gospel must occur "in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus." In order to preserve Paul's teaching, Timothy must exercise faith toward God and love toward others (cf. Matt. 22:36–40).

<span id="page-465-4"></span><span id="page-465-1"></span><span id="page-465-0"></span>The second command ("guard") refers to Timothy's pastoral duty to protect the standard from corruption by false teachers (cf. 1 Tim. 6:20; 2 Tim. 4:15). Here the standard is called "the good deposit"—an expression that parallels that of 1 Timothy 6:20 and refers to the apostolic message entrusted to him. Timothy's responsibility is not only to preach the message but to defend it (cf. Titus 1:9). This means that pastoral ministry necessarily involves confrontation, which Timothy is to undertake "by the power of the Holy Spirit." It is not Timothy's own resourcefulness that qualifies for the task but the presence of the Spirit who first indwelled Paul and now dwells powerfully within Timothy as well.

<span id="page-465-2"></span>1:15 "You are aware" means that Paul is referencing an event with which Timothy is well-acquainted. In this case it is that a group of believers, "all who are in Asia," has deserted Paul. It is difficult to identify this group of people with any certainty. "Asia" refers to the western part of modern-day Turkey, what was then the western part of the Roman province of Asia. But who are the "all" that Paul mentions? And when did they leave him? Some have suggested that "all" refers to all of the believers in Asia, but this seems unlikely. It is more likely that Paul has in mind members of some smaller group in Asia, all of whom have left Paul. Although we cannot definitively identify this group, it is possible that Paul mentions Phygelus and Hermogenes because they are among its leaders.

Paul says that they have "turned away" (Gk. *apostrephō*; in this context "turn away from by rejecting" [BDAG]). We might even render the term "reject" or "repudiate," indicating that these men have not left Paul for some small reason. They have done so because they were ashamed of him. They are negative examples of what Paul instructs Timothy to do, which is *not* to be ashamed. When the going got tough, they got going: they deserted Paul. Their faithfulness to Paul—and thus to his gospel ministry—was only as deep as their willingness to suffer. And there was not much depth there at all, so they left him.

<span id="page-465-3"></span>1:16–18 In contrast to Phygelus, Hermogenes, and "all" who were in Asia, there was Onesiphorus. Onesiphorus was not ashamed of Paul or his gospel. For this reason, Paul asks for divine mercy on his behalf. But notice that Paul refers not only to Onesiphorus but also to his entire "household," which likely refers to <span id="page-466-1"></span>his family. Why would Paul focus on Onesiphorus's family in this invocation of divine mercy? It may be that both Onesiphorus and his family have paid a price for Onesiphorus's association with Paul. Perhaps Onesiphorus has already died. This would explain Paul's reference to the last judgment (v. 18) and would also mean that Onesiphorus's family are the only ones left for Paul to pray for. The exact details are not clear, but what is clear is that there was a price for associating with Paul, and Onesiphorus's entire family may have paid it. Onesiphorus and his family sacrificed to be merciful to Paul, and now Paul is praying for them to receive mercy. In writing this, Paul may have in mind the words of Jesus himself, who pronounced, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy" (Matt. 5:7).

<span id="page-466-0"></span>Onesiphorus's unique honor was that he was not "ashamed" of Paul's chains. On the contrary, Onesiphorus sought Paul out, associated with him, implicated himself in Paul's shame, and took care of Paul's needs while he was imprisoned in Rome. When everyone else had refused Paul's shame, Onesiphorus embraced it even at the risk of his own family. Onesiphorus is an exemplar of ministry without shame in his faithfulness to Paul not only in Rome but also in Ephesus, which Timothy knows about as well.

### *Response*

Onesiphorus's legacy is instructive. It is one thing to ask a man to make sacrifices for the sake of the gospel. It is another thing to ask a man's family to make those same sacrifices. How many of us would be willing to do so? Onesiphorus thought it was worth it, and apparently so did his family. Paul prays for mercy on both of them. Do we believe that the mercy of God is sufficient for ourselves and for whatever sacrifice we or our families may be called on to make for the sake of the gospel?

### *Section Overview*

Verse 1 of chapter 2 brings a command: "be strengthened." Paul is calling Timothy to something that is beyond what he can do in his own strength. It will require divine enabling to carry out his ministry in the face of suffering and opposition. Paul has commanded Timothy not to be ashamed of the gospel or of Paul, the one imprisoned for the gospel. He has commanded Timothy to "follow the pattern of the sound words" that he has heard from Paul and to "guard the good deposit" (2 Tim. 1:13–14). Timothy cannot do any of this in his own strength. He must rely on God's help if he is going to continue on in the ministry to which God has called him.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-467-2"></span>2:1 "You then" connects this verse to what Paul has just said at the end of chapter 1. Paul's logic is as follows: "Because of the work you have to do in Ephesus and because of Onesiphorus's exemplary, unashamed example, Timothy, you must be strengthened." The "strengthening" is in the passive voice—the strength Timothy needs is not something he can give to himself. It is something that must be given to him from the outside. It is understood that the *agent* of the strengthening is God. The *means* of the strengthening is the grace to be found only in Christ (cf. 2 Cor. 3:5).

<span id="page-467-3"></span><span id="page-467-0"></span>2:2 Timothy needs strength in order to carry out the work of gospel ministry, the work to which every pastor has to give himself. In a broader sense, this is the work to which every Christian must give himself or herself, because it is nothing less than the expansion of Christ's kingdom through the propagation of the gospel. The church grows and people are added to the number of the saved as Christians hand on the faith to the next generation. Paul is particularly concerned with Timothy's duty to pass on the gospel. But notice that this text has four generations in view:

```
1st generation = Paul ("from me")
2nd generation = Timothy ("what you have heard")
3rd generation = Timothy's disciples ("entrust to faithful men")
4th generation = Timothy's disciples' disciples ("others")
```
Timothy's ministry has a source and a goal: its source is the apostolic gospel contained in Scripture, and its goal is to pass on that message to the coming generations. Timothy is to reproduce himself in disciples who follow his teaching. And those disciples are to reproduce themselves in the disciples who follow their teaching.

<span id="page-468-1"></span>2:3 Timothy needs strength for ministry mainly because such work necessarily brings opposition. Sometimes this opposition results in suffering for the sake of the gospel. Timothy must, literally, "suffer together" (Gk. συγκακοπάθησον) with Paul if he is to be a faithful pastor. Suffering is a command, not an option, and it is shared. As Paul has already testified in this letter, he himself is suffering, and he is simply exhorting Timothy to follow in his footsteps. Even in this, Paul is not the trailblazer; Jesus is. Jesus suffered, and his disciples must share in his lot.

Timothy must suffer as a "good soldier of Christ Jesus." This is the first of three images illustrating the commitment that Timothy must exhibit. These three images each tell us something about what is required of one called to suffer for the sake of the gospel.

<span id="page-468-2"></span>2:4 The soldier illustrates single-mindedness. A soldier does not get "entangled in civilian pursuits"; he does not get distracted by things unessential to his mission. One commentator puts it this way: "The soldier's goal is to 'please' or satisfy the wishes of the commander, who expects nothing less than complete attention to duty so that the military objectives will be accomplished."3

<span id="page-468-3"></span>2:5 The athlete illustrates discipline to compete according to the rules. Paul's readers would be familiar with athletic contests such as the Isthmian Games in Corinth or the Olympic games in Olympia. Competing "according to the rules" refers either to the rules of the individual contests or perhaps to the ten months of training necessary to qualify for the games. In any case, the point is clear: the only way to win the prize is to compete according to the rules.

<span id="page-468-0"></span>The analogy to the Christian faith is simple. There is a "rule" when it comes to following Christ. One of the rules of following Christ is the willingness to suffer for him (Matt. 16:24). Anyone unwilling to endure this is unable to be his disciple. No one can receive the victor's crown if he will not be faithful in suffering.

<sup>3</sup> Philip H. Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, NICNT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2006), 493.

<span id="page-469-8"></span>2:6 The farmer illustrates hard work. If a farmer refuses to wake up early and put his shoulder to the plow, he will have no crop to harvest. To have no harvest is to have no share in the reward. Lazy people make bad farmers. They also make bad Christians. If someone would follow Christ, he must have a dedicated work ethic, a commitment to the task at hand. Anyone willing to undertake austerity and industry will have "the first share of the crops"—which in this case indicates fruitfulness.

<span id="page-469-9"></span><span id="page-469-7"></span><span id="page-469-2"></span>2:7 "Think over what I say" is a command urging Timothy to consider carefully the analogies of verses 4–6. The word translated "think" (Gk. *noei* ) does not denote mere passing interest but rather urges Timothy to "think over with care" or to "consider" (BDAG). This is the same term used in the Olivet Discourse to invite readers to "understand" the innermost meaning and implication of Jesus' prophecy (Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14). It is this kind of insight that Paul wishes for Timothy to have regarding his words, "for the Lord will give you understanding in everything." The "Lord" in this case is likely God the Father rather than God the Son.4 As elsewhere, it is the Father who gives understanding and insight into spiritual things (cf. Prov. 2:6 LXX; Matt. 16:17; Eph. 3:2–4). Accordingly, Paul grounds his command on the guarantee that the Lord will help Timothy understand all of the implications of these illustrations of single-mindedness, discipline, and hard work.

<span id="page-469-10"></span><span id="page-469-1"></span>2:8 Paul commands Timothy to "remember" because this will be the means by which Timothy is strengthened to endure through suffering. Paul wants Timothy to remember specific things about Jesus:

<span id="page-469-3"></span>(1) Jesus is raised ("risen from the dead"). "Risen" is in the perfect tense; for Paul, Jesus' resurrection is not merely a past event but has results continuing into the present (cf. 1 Cor. 15:4, 12). The perfect tense indicates that Jesus was not only alive in the flesh when he appeared to his apostles in the upper room but also remains alive and in the flesh as seated at the right hand of the Father.

<span id="page-469-0"></span>(2) Jesus is King ("the offspring of David"). The phrase is literally "the seed of David," connecting directly to 2 Samuel 7:12–13, in which God promises to raise up the "seed" of David to rule over a kingdom that will last forever. This "seed" of David will be God's own Son (cf. Gal. 3:16, 19). By remembering this, Timothy can remain single-minded.

<span id="page-469-5"></span>(3) Jesus is truly taught ("as preached in my gospel"). When Paul refers to "my gospel," he is inviting Timothy to remember that Christ himself had appointed Paul to be an apostle. The way Paul preaches Jesus is the standard for preaching Jesus. Those who preach a Jesus that does not match up with the one Paul preached are in the wrong (cf. 2 Cor. 11:4).

<span id="page-469-11"></span><span id="page-469-6"></span><span id="page-469-4"></span>2:9 The antecedent of "for which" is the "gospel" in verse 8: the gospel is the reason for Paul's suffering (cf. 1:12). This also indicates that Paul's suffering in prison is current at the time of his writing. Even though Paul is enchained, however, the

<sup>4</sup> Cf. Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 396.

<span id="page-470-1"></span><span id="page-470-0"></span>"word of God" is not. As elsewhere, the "word of God" is the gospel (cf. 1 Cor. 14:36; 2 Cor. 2:17; 4:2; Eph. 6:17; Col. 1:25; 1 Thess. 2:13). This gospel word is alive and active and cannot be restrained by prisons or chains: "The word of God is not bound." This verb is in the perfect tense, indicating that the gospel has not been bound in the past and is not bound now. The gospel word is the power of God unto salvation, and it is not subject to the weaknesses and limitations of the ones carrying it. They can be imprisoned; God's word cannot be.

<span id="page-470-3"></span>2:10 To "endure" means to "maintain a belief or course of action in the face of opposition" (BDAG, s.v. ὑπομένω). In the Greek text, "endure" is modified by two prepositional phrases: "On account of this, I endure on account of the elect." It is crucial to notice how the "on account of" statements connect Paul's endurance both to what comes before verse 10 and to what comes in the latter half of verse 10. The ESV correctly renders "on account of this" as "therefore." Paul endures suffering *because* the word of God is not bound (v. 9). His own apparently sad situation is no limitation on the word of God, which continues to go forth in power. Paul's confidence in the word motivates him to endure suffering faithfully.

He also suffers "for the sake of the elect." This second basis for Paul's endurance is not unrelated to the first; in fact, the two must be understood together. "On account of" is a prospective basis for Paul's endurance—that God's chosen people ("the elect") might hear the gospel and be saved and inherit eternal life (i.e., "eternal glory"); hence the ESV's "for the sake of." Because the word of God is not bound, Paul does not shrink back amid his suffering.

<span id="page-470-4"></span><span id="page-470-2"></span>2:11 The phrase "the saying is trustworthy" appears several times in the Pastorals (cf. comment on 1 Tim. 1:15). Here it seems to introduce a gospel word that has the earmarks of an early Christian hymn, which is why the ESV indents it like poetry on the page. The trustworthy (or "faithful") saying is this:

for:

If we have died with him, we will also live with him;

- **<sup>12</sup>** if we endure, we will also reign with him;
- if we deny him, he also will deny us;
	- **<sup>13</sup>** if we are faithless, he remains faithful—

for he cannot deny himself.

<span id="page-470-5"></span>Notice the word "endure" in verse 12, which links the hymn to Paul's word concerning endurance in verse 10. The verbal connection shows that Paul intends the truths conveyed in this hymn to be further grounds for endurance through suffering.

Some commentators interpret "died with him" as a reference to martyrdom those who have physically died for the gospel just as Jesus physically died. But that is probably not what Paul has in mind here. It is more likely that Paul has in <span id="page-471-2"></span>mind the same kind of "dying with" Christ that he refers to in Romans 6:8–11. That passage speaks not of the believer's own physical death but of his union with Christ's death and resurrection. Believers are joined to Christ by faith and through the Spirit. Their union with Christ results in his death's counting for them: he died as their representative and substitute. In that sense believers have "died with him," and this is likely what Paul has in mind here as well. All Christians are joined to Christ's death through faith. If we have died with him, we will also live with him—we will know new life now through the Holy Spirit.

In the same way, believers will also live with Christ. "Live" is in the future tense, which may anticipate the believer's future resurrection from the dead. Believers have new life in the present through the Holy Spirit. But the *future* life is a physical resurrection that will be just like Jesus' resurrection (cf. Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:20–23).

<span id="page-471-5"></span><span id="page-471-3"></span>2:12 The key term in this verse is "endure," which as noted above means to "maintain a belief or course of action in the face of opposition." The suffering that Paul has endured (v. 10) is the lot of every faithful Christian in the face of trials. "Endure" is present-tense, probably implying that ongoing endurance is the key. "If we are enduring" would be the sense, indicating that perseverance is the condition for blessedness in the age to come. In this text, such blessedness refers specifically to reigning with Christ in the age to come. Failure to endure certainly means that one will not reign. As the old saying goes, there is no crown without a cross. As it was with Christ himself, so it is also with those who would come after him.

<span id="page-471-1"></span><span id="page-471-0"></span>The text also warns that if we deny him now in the face of opposition, he will deny us at the judgment. This warning resembles what Jesus himself said about those who deny his lordship: he will deny them at the judgment (cf. Matt. 10:33; Luke 12:9). To be denied at the judgment is the ultimate devastation, but such is the cost of a definitive and unwavering denial of Christ.

<span id="page-471-6"></span><span id="page-471-4"></span>2:13 Some interpreters define "faithless" as "without faith." On this view, "faithless" describes a condition of settled unbelief. As a result, God's faithfulness here must refer to his faithfulness to punish those who do not believe (2 Thess. 1:8). There is, however, a better way to understand this term. "Faithless" is not a condition of settled unbelief but refers to temporary *unfaithfulness* after which one might be renewed again to repentance. Thus God's faithfulness refers to his unwillingness to give up on his people even though their holiness is not as consistent as it should be. In that sense, God is faithful even when his people are not.

### *Response*

For Paul, the doctrine of election does not make him less evangelistic but more. He knows that the Word of God is not bound and that God has a people he has chosen for himself. These two truths combine to form a powerful motivation for evangelism because they guarantee that faithfulness leads to fruitfulness. One can know that God will work powerfully to accomplish his will and that he aims to use his people to achieve it.

If the doctrine of election makes someone less evangelistic, then that person has failed to grasp the doctrine properly. The doctrine of election is to fill the believer with confidence to preach the gospel no matter what opposition he meets. It is to fill him with the courage to speak when others shrink back because he knows that God will use his Word powerfully to save sinners. The evidence of a proper understanding of election is a passionate concern for evangelism.

### *Section Overview*

In chapter 1, Paul told Timothy not to be ashamed of the gospel but to be ready to suffer. In the first half of chapter 2, Paul commanded Timothy to entrust the gospel to faithful men who would be able to teach others. Now in 2:14–26 he exhorts Timothy to handle the truth of the gospel as the Lord's servant. This instruction unfolds in three steps, as indicated by the outline below.

### *Section Outline*

- II. Pastoral Courage for Endurance (2:1–26) . . .
	- B. An Unashamed Worker for Christ (2:14–26)
		- 1. Accuracy in the Truth (2:14–18)
		- 2. Discipline for the Truth (2:19–21)
		- 3. Correction toward the Truth (2:22–26)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-473-2"></span>2:14 The initial imperative "remind" invites us to consider two questions. First, who are the "them" in this verse? Second, of what is Timothy to remind them? It is possible that "remind them" means "remind Christians in general." But the focus on how their words affect "hearers" probably means that Paul has teachers and church leaders particularly in mind. If so, "them" refers to the "faithful men" of verse 2 who are to "teach others also." Thus Timothy is to remind these faithful men of everything Paul has said in verses 3–13.

<span id="page-473-4"></span><span id="page-473-1"></span>Paul tells Timothy not merely to remind but to command: "Charge them before God not to quarrel about words." At first glance, this command may confuse some readers. How are they to confront false teachers (as Paul has told them to do) if they are not to "quarrel about words"? Is defending the faith against false teaching not by definition a quarrel about words? The word translated "quarrel" is a compound that literally means "word-war" (*logomachein*). The "word" portion of that compound appears three more times in this one paragraph (vv. 15, 17, 18). As these verses make clear, "word" refers to what is taught either by faithful pastors or by unfaithful false teachers. Thus the term "word-war" is not referring to "hairsplitting" the definition of terms (contra BDAG). Paul is not reproving a quibble over semantics. In this case, the word-war refers to a word-war against truth; a war on the Word of God itself. If this is true, then the "word warriors" are false teachers who are teaching against God's truth. That is why Paul tells Timothy never to do so (v. 14) but to handle accurately the word of truth (v. 15). Such false teaching is not only useless (it "does no good") but it also leads to the spiritual corruption of those who hear and believe it.

<span id="page-473-3"></span><span id="page-473-0"></span>2:15 "Rightly handling" comes from the Greek term *orthotomeō*. English readers may recognize the prefix *ortho*- from our English word "orthodox." In this term, however, the prefix simply means "straight" and is added to a verb meaning "to cut" (*temnō*). The term is used in Proverbs 3:6 to refer to how God makes our paths straight. So here it likely means something along the lines of "to cut a straight path." On that reading, the term would denote a need to "guide the word of truth along a straight path (like a road that goes straight to its goal), without being turned aside by wordy debates or impious talk" (BDAG). And so handling the Word of God rightly requires a fixed determination to stay on point, to explain and apply God's Word according to its meaning and intent.

Paul's exhortation to the pastor Timothy is the exhortation for every pastor: handle the Word of God rightly. The "word of truth" certainly refers to the gospel, which was anticipated in the OT and is now made known in the preaching of the apostles. Timothy may not play fast and loose with God's revelation but must handle it with care and accuracy. It is not permissible for Timothy to say whatever comes to mind; he is to make known and to apply only what God has said. He is not to be an innovator of new revelation; he is an expositor of a revelation already given.

It is noteworthy that the main command of this verse is not to be one "rightly handling the word of truth" but rather to "do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed." That is the primary command and thus the ultimate goal of Timothy's ministry. Timothy must acknowledge that his primary audience is God, who hears and knows and who will judge every word from Timothy's mouth.

<span id="page-474-4"></span>2:16–17 Timothy is to avoid "irreverent babble"—he must steer clear of profane "talk that has no value" (BDAG, s.v. κενοφωνία). Paul warns Timothy to shun godless talking that serves no good purpose. This "irreverent babble" is precisely the kind of "word-warring" that Paul has been warning against, and it must be avoided at all costs, for two reasons. First, it corrupts God's people: "It will lead people into more and more ungodliness."

Second, such talk has the spiritual effect of killing God's people: "Their talk will spread like gangrene." It infects the body, destroys the tissue, and spreads until it kills the organism. The faithful pastor, therefore, must help God's people to avoid such teaching.

<span id="page-474-2"></span>Among those responsible for spreading this deadly teaching are two men, Hymenaeus and Philetus. We know very little about Philetus outside of this text; Hymenaeus is mentioned also in 1 Timothy 1:20, which names him as a false teacher. Paul says in 1 Timothy that he had handed Hymenaeus over to Satan so that he may learn not to blaspheme. This "[handing] over to Satan" is the language of church discipline and excommunication (cf. comment on 1 Tim. 1:20; cf. 1 Cor. 5:5). Even though we know very little about Philetus, his pairing with Hymenaeus suggests that his transgression is the same as Hymenaeus's; evidently both are guilty of propounding grievous error.

<span id="page-474-5"></span><span id="page-474-3"></span><span id="page-474-1"></span>2:18 Far from handling accurately the word of truth (v. 15), Hymenaeus and Philetus have "swerved from the truth" by teaching that the resurrection has already occurred. They were likely teaching that believers have already achieved resurrection in a spiritual sense as Christians and thus should not expect a future resurrection of the body at the last judgment. The implication of this teaching is that when a Christian dies, his spirit continues while his body does not. Perhaps the false teachers were basing this teaching on things they heard Paul say. If Paul's letters are any indication, it is not hard to see how some might distort his words to imply that Paul had a low view of the body and of God's creation (e.g., Rom. 6:11; Eph. 2:6; Col. 2:12).

<span id="page-474-0"></span>The false teachers may have been taking a real truth and twisting it beyond what Paul meant. Yes, Paul said that in one sense we have already been raised with Christ, but he also says that in another sense we are not yet raised. We have been given new life through the Spirit, but we are not yet raised in glorified bodies. The stakes are high in this particular bit of false teaching; to deny the resurrection is to miss the faith altogether (cf. 1 Corinthians 15).

<span id="page-475-3"></span><span id="page-475-1"></span>Hymenaeus and Philetus are "upsetting the faith of some." The term translated "upsetting" is the word John uses to describe Jesus' overturning the tables of the moneychangers in the temple (John 2:15). The term can mean to "*cause to fall*" or even to "*destroy*." In this text, there is a figurative extension of the term that indicates a spiritual destruction of a person's faith in Christ. The term means to "jeopardize someone's inner well-being" and even to "*ruin*" them (BDAG, s.v. ἀνατρέπω, italics original; cf. Titus 1:11). Again, Paul could not be any clearer about the serious nature of this particular bit of false teaching.

<span id="page-475-6"></span><span id="page-475-4"></span><span id="page-475-2"></span>2:19 In contrast to the failing faith of those under the spell of false teaching, "God's firm foundation stands." Paul uses "foundation" here and elsewhere as a metaphor for the apostolic gospel (1 Cor. 3:10–12). The gospel is like a foundation because God's people build their life and faith upon it; they find in it their meaning and purpose in life. The gospel undergirds everything; it defines how God's people live and relate to one another. How sturdy can this foundation be if false teachers infiltrate the ranks of the faithful? Yet the foundation stands; false teachers may advance temporarily, but the gospel will always come roaring back. The gospel will not be thwarted ultimately by false teachers. The foundation will hold.

The foundation stands not because of what people do to maintain it but because of what God has done. The foundation stands because it bears a "seal." A seal is the mark or impression made by some sort of signet—perhaps a ring. Wax would be used to seal a document, and a signet would be pressed to make an impression on the wax. The resulting inscription on the seal would thus indicate ownership. The seal here is a metaphor for God's guarantee of ownership. Inscribed on this seal is not God's name but his promises, consisting of two verses from Numbers 16: "The Lord knows those who are his," and "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."

<span id="page-475-0"></span>These two verses appear in the context of the narrative of Korah's rebellion in Numbers 16. Even though false teachers were in the midst of Israel (Korah in this case), they would not threaten the foundation God had already laid. Why? Not because of Moses and Aaron's efforts but because of God's efforts. The Lord knows those who are his and shows them the path of escape. This path involves fleeing from evil, which God's people do. "God knows and chooses his people, and they manifest that reality by abstaining from evil."5

<span id="page-475-5"></span>2:20–21 God knows how to tell the difference between those who are his people and those who are not. Timothy must be able to do the same. He and the congregation must be able to distinguish the sheep from the wolves. Just as God showed the <span id="page-476-3"></span>congregation of Israel that they should back away from Korah and his supporters, Paul tells Timothy to "depart" from false teachers (v. 19). Timothy and the congregation will have to call out false teaching for what it is and stand apart from it.

To illustrate this truth, Paul uses the image of a "great house" filled with "vessels" that are valuable and others that are not. There are vessels of "gold and silver" and of "wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable." The "great house" is the Christian community in a broad sense. Within the Christian community are some "vessels" for honorable use and others for dishonorable use. "Wood and earthenware vessels are regarded as dishonorable because they are used for garbage or excrement and are sometimes thrown out with their contents."6 The false teachers are like those dishonorable vessels: they are carrying filthy contents and are at risk of being thrown out of the household altogether. Indeed, the congregation has an obligation to turn them out if they fail to repent of their false teaching.

<span id="page-476-4"></span>The children of Israel were commanded to separate themselves from Korah or else share in his destruction. Verse 21 indicates that God's people must "cleanse" themselves from the false teachers: the church should put the false teachers under discipline. If false teachers do not repent, they must be excommunicated. Such false teachers compromise the witness of the church; they are not holy and are not useful "for every good work."

<span id="page-476-5"></span>2:22 "So" is an inferential conjunction. Because of the need for holiness (vv. 20–21), Timothy must "flee" that which would make him unholy. In verse 22, the unholiness from which he must flee is "youthful passions." Other translations render "passions" more specifically as sexual passion or lust (NASB, KJV, NLT).

Some commentators observe that the context is addressing false teaching and thus do not interpret "youthful desires" sexually. Rather, they argue that these "youthful desires" have to do with those desires that motivate the false teachers in their error. Still others claim that "youthful desires" refers to "youthful sins of judgment and temperament";7 "sexual lust does not seem to be the focus."8 But this is too narrow a reading of the term translated "passions" in the ESV.

<span id="page-476-1"></span>Commentators often miss the use of this term elsewhere that informs Paul's use of it here. The word translated "passions" in the ESV is the Greek word *epithymia*, a term that simply means "desire." It refers to the human experience of longing or craving for something, which motivates people to make the decisions they make. Paul provides a chapter-long meditation on what he means by this term *epithymia* in Romans 7. A literal translation illustrates the connection: "I would not have known about *desire* except that the law was saying, 'You shall not *desire*'" (Rom. 7:7). Paul would not even have known about desire unless the Mosaic law had explained it. And then he quotes Exodus 20:17, the tenth commandment. Thus Paul's understanding of *epithymia* is defined by the tenth commandment:

<span id="page-476-2"></span><span id="page-476-0"></span><sup>6</sup> Ibid., 418

<sup>7</sup> Ibid., 420.

<sup>8</sup> Towner, *Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 544.

"You shall not covet [or "desire"] your neighbor's house; you shall not [desire] your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's" (Ex. 20:17).

<span id="page-477-1"></span><span id="page-477-0"></span>When Paul singles out the tenth commandment in Romans 7, he does so because it may very well be the hardest of all the commandments. Whereas the other commandments address our *deeds*, the tenth commandment addresses our *desires*. According to this commandment, desires are not neutral. The desire for something sinful—anything sinful, sexual or otherwise—is itself sinful. It is not merely adultery or stealing or killing that are sinful—the desire for such things is also sinful. Desires commensurate with such deeds are themselves sinful. This is Paul's understanding of *epithymia*.

When Paul instructs Timothy to "flee youthful passions," he uses the same term he uses in Romans 7, the same term used in the Greek version of the tenth commandment. The desire Timothy must flee, therefore, is any desire for something God has forbidden. It is not limited to illicit sexual desire, but it certainly includes illicit sexual desire.

But why does Paul use the term "youthful"? He is not saying that these forbidden desires are experienced only by young people. The desires are "youthful" in the sense that they are undisciplined. Maturity and experience usually have a moderating effect on the way in which people encounter their desires. The younger and less experienced a person is, the less self-control they bring to their desires.

<span id="page-477-2"></span>Paul also commands Timothy to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace." Paul often exhibits a "put off"/"put on" balance in his ethical exhortation. For Paul, being a Christian is not just about being *against* something; it is also about being *for* something. In this case, he calls Timothy to shun evil desire and to pursue its opposite instead: righteousness, faith, love, and peace. Three out of the four virtues in the list appear as fruits of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22–23. When Paul commands Timothy to pursue these things, therefore, he is not calling him to do so alone; he is calling him to what the Spirit of God is already working inside him (Phil. 2:12–13). Timothy's active pursuit of holiness is not at odds with grace; his active striving against sin is not legalism. Timothy's effort to be holy reveals the work of the Spirit in him. The absence of striving would be evidence of the absence of the Spirit. Timothy must not simply stop doing the bad things; he must start pursuing the good things. He is not pursuing abstractions; he is pursuing God.

<span id="page-477-4"></span><span id="page-477-3"></span>Timothy must pursue these things "along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart." There is something precious here. Timothy need not pursue these things alone. He must pursue them along with a group of other people who are also pursuing the same things—i.e., the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. Such persons call on the Lord "from a pure heart." These believers are not calling on the Lord from an impure or hypocritical heart; they are not those who say one thing while doing another. They are striving to walk with Christ in integrity and holiness, encouraging one another toward the same goal (Heb. 10:23–25).

<span id="page-478-2"></span>2:23 Timothy is to "have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies." It is one thing for a pastor to confront false teaching threatening his own congregation; it is another thing to give a platform to false teachings that are not threatening that particular congregation. It is not worth getting into the fray of every controversy. To air out polemics in the pulpit with no concern for the needs of the particular congregation under one's care is pastoral malpractice. Unnecessary polemics can stir up strife where before there was none.

<span id="page-478-3"></span>2:24 Timothy is not to be "quarrelsome" but rather "kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil." It matters not only *that* Timothy contends for the faith but also *how* he contends. If he is angry and pugnacious instead of kind, no one will listen to him (cf. Prov. 15:1–2; 16:21). He must "patiently [endure] evil," not avenging personal slights but defending the truth of God and advancing his mission.

<span id="page-478-4"></span><span id="page-478-0"></span>2:25–26 Paul mentions another aim, one that will not even be on the radar if Timothy is merely seeking to win an argument. He must be "correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will." Timothy's refutation of false teaching is first and foremost a way of protecting the sheep, but it may also be a means of persuading his opponents. Timothy must communicate persuasively, commending the gospel to the false teachers with the hope that they might repent and be won back to the faith.

### *Response*

If the error of Hymenaeus and Philetus is a distortion of apostolic teaching, there is a lesson for us. Most of the time, false teaching has appeal in the church not because it does not use the Bible but because it does. False teachers often make use of the Bible to propound their error; this is part of their appeal and also what makes them deceptive. They use the Bible but distort its meaning in order to prop up false teaching. Thus it is not enough for a teacher to use the Bible; he must handle the Word of truth accurately. Unfortunately, many do not. And pastors and congregations are called to know the difference.

<span id="page-478-1"></span>Fleeing youthful passions requires willingness to flee situations that provoke us to such sins (Rom. 13:14). We should not do things, associate with people, or go to places which we know will arouse evil desires in our hearts. The desires are already there—the question is whether we will provoke them through undisciplined conduct or will have the self-control not to make provision for the flesh.

3 But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. **2**For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, **3**heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, **<sup>4</sup>** treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, **5**having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power.

### *Section Overview*

In the first two chapters, Paul has exhorted Timothy to stay true to the gospel, not to be ashamed of it, and even to suffer for it. He has warned Timothy to steer clear of false teaching even as he has told him to confront false teachers. In 2 Timothy 3:1–9, Paul widens the lens to discuss how opposition to the gospel defines the last days. Paul says that difficult times are coming, and explains why. Finally, he warns that false teachers will emerge amid the general wickedness characterizing the last days.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-479-1"></span>3:1 "But" indicates a contrast with the end of chapter 2. There Paul told Timothy to confront false teachers in the hopes that "God may perhaps grant them repentance." There is a ray of hope that perhaps those in open conflict with the gospel might come around to the truth instead of opposing it openly.

Paul begins this section with "but" to indicate a contrast in expectations. Timothy will not always be able to win over his opponents. The world is filled with <span id="page-480-2"></span>opponents of the gospel, who make things difficult for God's people. Timothy must "understand" what the church is facing: "in the last days there will come times of difficulty." When Paul refers to the "last days," he refers not to some "yet-to-come period of days" but to what the NT always means by that phrase.9 The "last days" is the time between Jesus' resurrection and his second coming (Acts 2:17; Heb. 1:1–2). This final period of history includes every day from Pentecost until now and every day from now until Jesus returns. The NT church is and has always been in the "last days." And Paul says here that this entire period will be characterized by difficulty.

<span id="page-480-1"></span>The word translated as "difficulty" appears one other time in the NT, in Matthew 8:28, where it refers to the violence of two demon-possessed men. This Greek word is defined by one lexicon as "hard to bear, painful, sore, grievous" (LSJ, s.v. χαλεπός). This age—these last days—is marked by active opposition to Christ and his purposes in the world. Such opposition causes difficulty and pain for God's people.

<span id="page-480-3"></span>3:2–5 The text explains why difficult times are coming: "For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money," etc. Difficult people cause difficult times. People who do not know Christ can be "hard to bear, painful, sore, grievous," thus making the times likewise "hard to bear, painful, sore, grievous" (cf. previous comment). Paul lists nineteen characteristics of people in these last days. These nineteen characteristics are what people have always been like apart from grace:

(1) "Lovers of self." Such people put their own needs and wants before everyone else's. This trait is the opposite of the first fruit of the Spirit, which is love for others. Such self-regard is the fountainhead of every other evil—it is the ultimate idolatry.

<span id="page-480-0"></span>(2) "Lovers of money." Jesus made clear that people cannot serve both God and money (Matt. 6:24).

(3, 4) "Proud, arrogant." The word translated "proud" refers to one who boasts and brags (BDAG, s.v. ἀλαζών). "Arrogant" indicates a heart that gives birth to such boasting and bragging. Both are condemned here. These are the kind of people God rejects: "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" (James 4:6).

<span id="page-480-4"></span>(5) "Abusive" comes from the Greek word *blasphēmoi*, from which we derive the word "blasphemy." The term refers not to speaking against God but to speaking abusively of others, using words to defame, denigrate, and demean (BDAG).

(6) "Disobedient to their parents." The OT makes clear that disobedience to parents is a serious sin. Such disobedience reveals a heart unwilling to come under authority.

(7) "Ungrateful." The inability to give thanks for blessings is a sign of godlessness. This particular manifestation of ingratitude may be with reference to parents.

(8) "Unholy" pertains to "opposition to God or what is sacred" (BDAG, s.v. ἀνόσιος).

(9) "Heartless" paints a picture of one who is "without natural affection" (LSJ, s.v. ἄστοργος). The term may be understood in connection with "disobedient to their parents"—love for parents is a natural affection, but this person is "without natural affection." He does not even love his own parents.

(10) "Unappeasable" refers to one "unwilling to negotiate a solution to a problem involving a second party" (BDAG, s.v. ἄσπονδος). This person is unwilling to reconcile after a conflict; he just likes to win. Even when such a person is wrong, he or she is more interested in saving face than in saving the relationship.

(11) "Slanderous" is another way of referring to one who uses abusive speech against other people. It comes from the Greek term *diabolos*, the same word used of the Devil in 2:26. One who talks like this does the Devil's work.

<span id="page-481-3"></span>(12) "Without self-control." One of the fruits of the Spirit in Galatians 5 is self-control. In contrast, these people are without the Spirit and so cannot control themselves. They are still enslaved to their own sinful desires and longings; they cannot and will not break free of them.

(13) "Brutal" likens those in question to brute, violent, unthinking beasts.

(14) "Not loving good" draws us back to the beginning of the list. Evildoers love themselves and their own interests but do not love the good. This is the sinner's natural condition apart from grace.

(15) "Treacherous" describes someone who is a "*traitor*" or "*betrayer*" (BDAG, s.v. προδότης, italics original). This same Greek word is used of Judas Iscariot in Luke 6:16.

<span id="page-481-0"></span>(16) "Reckless" translates a term pertaining to one who is "impetuous, *rash, reckless, thoughtless*" (BDAG, s.v. προπετής, italics original) and refers to "those who stop at nothing to gain their ends."10

(17) "Swollen with conceit" describes one who is "puffed up," whose selfestimation is much higher than God's estimation of him. He lacks the humility of a sinner saved by grace, and so is arrogant (cf. 1 Tim. 3:6; 6:4).

<span id="page-481-2"></span>(18) "Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God" portrays those who are preoccupied with pleasing themselves rather than pleasing God.

(19) "Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power." This describes those who externally have all of the accouterments of authentic religion and piety yet on the inside differ not at all from unbelievers. They are enslaved to their sin. They take the name of Christianity on their lips but they do not have the power of Christ in their hearts. Paul commands Timothy to "avoid such people" (cf. 1 Cor. 5:11).

<span id="page-481-1"></span>Paul's point is this: sometimes as the church confronts the world, the world creeps into the church. Timothy and the congregation must be vigilant to keep clear of this kind of compromise. Paul does not mean to say that every sinner manifests each and every one of these characteristics. He simply means that these are the kinds of things that will be normal among sinners apart from grace. The human condition apart from Christ is desperate.

<span id="page-481-4"></span>"Times of difficulty" (2 Tim. 3:1) afflict the church because the church is surrounded by difficult people who are lovers of themselves and not lovers of God. The 2 Timothy 3:1–9 482

only way to transform "difficult times" into good times is to transform "difficult people" into saved people. The only one who can do this is Jesus.

<span id="page-482-1"></span>3:6 This group of faux-Christians will produce some who become false teachers. They will "creep" into households and ensnare "weak women" to follow their error. Paul is not saying that *all* women are "weak" in this sense, only that some in Ephesus fit this description. They are overly influenced by their own sinful natures and desires, and these false teachers sense this weakness and exploit it for their own purposes. This is why many false teachers are known for immorality. They sniff out weakness and devour Christ's sheep in order to seek their own pleasure and purpose. In every generation, these kinds of spiritual predators threaten the church. On the outside they look harmless but on the inside they are ravenous wolves. Churches must recognize them and oppose their error.

<span id="page-482-2"></span>3:7 The vulnerable women of verse 6 are "always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth." They like to keep an open mind to whatever someone might suggest, but their minds are so open that they are never able to reach a settled conviction about the truth. In the end they are taken in by every intellectual fad that comes their way and thus never plant their feet firmly in what God has said in his Word.

<span id="page-482-3"></span>3:8 Extrabiblical Jewish tradition (which may or may not be correct) names Jannes and Jambres as magicians who served Pharaoh and imitated Moses' miracles. They were able to distract from the true God by imitating the miracles. In that sense, they opposed the truth, and the false teachers in Ephesus do the same.

<span id="page-482-4"></span>3:9 Such false teachers "will not get very far." The error of false teachers has a limited appeal because they cannot keep up their ruse indefinitely. Just as Jannes and Jambres were eventually exposed by the true revelation of God in Moses, so false teachers will eventually be exposed by the apostolic word proclaimed in the churches. The folly of the false teachers will be plain to all because Christ's sheep will hear his voice and follow him (John 10:27).

### <span id="page-482-0"></span>*Response*

We must be forthright about the "times of difficulty" we face. None of the opposition we face is a surprise to God. Nor should it surprise us—God told us it would be this way. He does not merely warn us about opposition, however; he also promises us that on the other side of tribulation we will inherit a kingdom that cannot be taken away. We can suffer for Christ in the present because of the promise of his deliverance in the future and because of his powerful presence with us amid the suffering.

### <span id="page-483-2"></span>2 TIMOTHY 3:10–15

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-483-0"></span>Paul focuses in this paragraph on a contrast between the false teachers and Timothy, a faithful teacher. The first part of the chapter noted that the "last days" would be marked by godlessness, and some of the ungodly will creep into the church, pose as Christians, and seek to deceive God's people. In this paragraph, however, Paul twice says "but you" (2 Tim. 3:10, 14) in order to draw a sharp contrast: there will be no shortage of wolves seeking to devour the sheep, but Timothy has followed Paul's way of life and must continue in the truth he learned from him.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-483-1"></span>3:10–11 "You" is singular, indicating that Paul refers specifically to Timothy. In contrast to the false teachers, Timothy has faithfully "followed" Paul's way of life and ministry; that is, he has conformed his own beliefs to what Paul teaches and preaches (BDAG, s.v. παρακολουθέω). False teachers do not follow the apostolic standard, whereas Paul affirms that Timothy does follow that standard, in nine different areas:

(1) "Teaching" refers to the truth of the gospel that Paul teaches; the apostle affirms that Timothy believes and propagates his delivery of the faith.

(2) "Conduct" means that Timothy has followed the leading of Paul's "*way of life*" (BDAG, s.v. ἀγωγή, italics original). Timothy follows not only Paul's beliefs but also his behavior.

(3) "Aim in life" translates a single word that means "*purpose*" or something "planned in advance" (BDAG, s.v. πρόθεσις, italics original). Paul had a purpose in ministry, and Timothy has followed it.

<span id="page-484-5"></span><span id="page-484-4"></span>(4) "Faith" is "trust in or absolute dependence on God"11 (cf. 1 Tim. 4:12; 6:11; 2 Tim. 2:22).

(5) "Patience" refers to the ability "to bear up under provocation, *forbearance*, *patience* toward others" (BDAG, s.v. μακροθυμία, italics original). Just as Paul has responded faithfully to persecution and suffering, so also has Timothy.

(6) "Love" is the characteristic Christian virtue, the first fruit of the Spirit, that which sets believers apart from the world. Christians love one another, their neighbors, and even their enemies. Timothy has followed love in this sense.

(7) "Steadfastness" is sometimes translated "endurance" and refers to the ability "to hold out or bear up in the face of difficulty" (BDAG, s.v. ὑπομονή). The term anticipates the final two characteristics of Timothy's faithfulness. Timothy not only follows Paul's teaching and conduct but also willingly enters into his suffering for the gospel.

(8) "Persecutions" refers to a "program or process designed to harass and oppress" (BDAG, s.v. διωγμός). This term is plural—Paul was persecuted continuously for preaching the gospel.

(9) "Sufferings" are the result of the aforementioned persecution.

<span id="page-484-1"></span><span id="page-484-0"></span>Paul specifies instances of persecution from his first missionary journey, "at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra" (cf. Acts 13:45, 50; 14:1–5, 19). In Pisidian Antioch, the Jews persecuted Paul. In Iconium, some in the city sought to kill him by stoning, but he escaped. In Lystra, on the other hand, "They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead" (Acts 14:19). Yet Paul continued to preach, even returning to the very cities that had sought to end his life (Acts 14:21) and preaching the gospel to them again. Along the way he "strengthened" and "encouraged" the disciples, telling them that "through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22).

<span id="page-484-3"></span><span id="page-484-2"></span>When we understand the extent of Paul's suffering, we begin to see the significance of how Timothy has "followed" Paul into persecution, with resolve in spite of the risk. Timothy is unafraid to suffer.

<span id="page-484-6"></span>3:12 Lest we think that this kind of suffering is only for leaders such as Timothy, Paul warns that "All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted." Persecution and suffering are not the exclusive preserve of the pastor; anyone who wishes to follow Christ—indeed "all" believers—will face a measure <span id="page-485-1"></span>of suffering. Jesus himself says that "whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:27). One cannot be an authentic Christian if he is unwilling to follow Jesus into suffering—even the suffering that leads to death.

Paul offers no exceptions to "all," but we must be careful not to conclude too quickly that someone not suffering must not be a believer. A Christian's living out a peaceful life indicates one of two things:

(1) They have not experienced persecution *yet*, but will.

<span id="page-485-0"></span>(2) We have misunderstood what the Bible means by "persecution." We tend to think of "persecution" solely in terms of intense forms of suffering for the faith. Yet Christ says that to "revile" or to "utter all kinds of evil against you" fits in the category of "persecution" (Matt. 5:10–12). Thus persecution does not always involve physical suffering that could lead to death. Persecution involves any form of mistreatment for the sake of the gospel, ranging anywhere from verbal opposition to being arrested to losing all of one's possessions or even to physical suffering and loss of life.

<span id="page-485-3"></span>3:13 "Evil people" and "impostors" are clearly the false teachers previously mentioned. They pose as believers but are not truly so. Over time their error and twisted behavior expose them for what they are as they go "from bad to worse." Further, they are "deceiving and being deceived," indicating that often these false teachers are sincere. They do not merely deceive people; they also deceive themselves, believing their own error. Timothy must keep in mind that sincerity is not the same thing as faithfulness to the gospel. A person can be sincere and at the same time be sincerely wrong. Sincerity is no measure of a person's truthfulness—faithfulness to the apostolic standard is.

<span id="page-485-4"></span>3:14 Paul commands Timothy to persevere in the apostolic standard of faith, no matter how compelling the false teachers are, no matter how attractive their message is to the flesh. Timothy must be unmovable. He must not listen to the deception of the deceived but rather continue in the truth of the gospel.

Timothy must continue because he knows from whom he has learned the faith. It may be surprising that Paul does not appeal immediately to the character of Scripture but rather appeals to the character of those who taught that Scripture to Timothy. The faith of Lois and Eunice is now Timothy's faith. And Paul appeals to the faithful Christian character of these women as a basis for Timothy's continued confidence in what he has learned from them.

<span id="page-485-2"></span>With these solemn words, Paul recognizes the importance of the calling of motherhood. He invites readers to consider the singularly powerful impact that a faithful mother and grandmother can have on children and grandchildren. Timothy's father was apparently not a Christian, and yet this did not prevent Timothy from coming to faith through the witness of his mother and grandmother. A mother can make her mark on her child like no one else can (cf. 1 Cor. 7:14). God can use her to raise up servants who would lay down their lives for <span id="page-486-0"></span>Christ. A child holds a special place in his heart for his mother. When "times of difficulty" (2 Tim. 3:1) come in the life of that child, the memory of a mother's faithfulness to Christ may very well carry that child through the storm. The child will follow Jesus because his mother did. Paul affirms the glorious potential of motherhood with the words "knowing from whom you learned it."

<span id="page-486-1"></span>3:15 From the time of Timothy's infancy, Lois and Eunice taught him what we now call the OT. They planted those seeds, and God caused the growth. The Scripture they gave Timothy was "able to make [him] wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." Timothy became a Christian because he heard God's Word, and he heard God's Word because of two faithful women. The Word that transformed Lois and Eunice powerfully transformed Timothy. Timothy knows the power of this Word for those who hold fast to it, and this power to transform is a reason to believe.

### *Response*

In the West, persecution of Christian has been on the easier end of the spectrum. What we go through in terms of mistreatment can hardly be compared to brothers and sisters around the world who are losing their families and their lives for the gospel. Nevertheless, as long as we live in this world, all of us are somewhere on the spectrum of suffering for our faith. Our experience in the West tends not to be as intense as others' experiences, but our situation could change at any moment. We must be ready.

### <span id="page-486-2"></span>2 TIMOTHY 3:16–17

**<sup>16</sup>**All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, **<sup>17</sup>** that the man of God*<sup>1</sup>* may be complete, equipped for every good work.

1That is, a messenger of God (the phrase echoes a common Old Testament expression)

### *Section Overview*

Paul has instructed Timothy to continue in the apostolic faith and not to turn aside from it in the face of suffering and persecution. Timothy must instead continue to trust in the Word of God because of the trustworthiness of those who taught the word to him—Lois and Eunice. Timothy's confidence does not, however, depend on the character of Lois and Eunice alone. His confidence must stand finally on the nature and character of Scripture itself. Paul explains what Scripture is, what Scripture does, and what Scripture produces.

	- 1. What Scripture Is (3:16a)
	- 2. What Scripture Does (3:16b)
	- 3. What Scripture Produces (3:17)

### *Comment*

<span id="page-487-0"></span>3:16a The term translated "Scripture" is the Greek word *graphē*, from which we get our English suffix *-graph* (as in *paragraph*). In general, the word denotes writing of some sort. In the NT this word is used as a technical term to refer to the Word of God written in the thirty-nine books of the OT. Paul in his statement specifies "all" Scripture, not just some; the use of "all" may indicate that Paul wishes to stress each and every individual passage of Scripture.

The phrase "breathed out by God" translates a single word from the Greek: *theopneustos*. This compound consists of two parts, the words for "God" (*theos*) and for "breathe" ( *pneō*). Some translations render the compound as "inspired," an acceptable translation that is nevertheless not as accurate as "God-breathed," which emphasizes the divine authority of Scripture. When the Bible speaks, God speaks. The very "writings" themselves have the characteristic of "God-breathedness." They *are* God's Word.

The word translated "profitable" means that all Scripture is useful, beneficial, or advantageous (BDAG, s.v. ὠφέλιμος). Scripture is good for God's people precisely because it is the Word of God. In fact, we might loosely render this phrase, "All Scripture is God-breathed and *therefore* is good for you."

These two attributes of Scripture are often the most challenging to accept and are the two attributes of Scripture false teachers and critics regularly attack. Such critics do not want hearers to have confidence in Scripture as the Word of God. If they fail to convince that Scripture is not God's Word, then they seek to convince that it is not good for God's people. The faith of believers can falter on either one of those points.

<span id="page-487-1"></span>3:16b Scripture is "profitable" for readers in regard to four very specific tasks:

(1) "Teaching." Scripture tells readers positively what they must believe; it gives sound doctrine.

(2) "Reproof." Scripture tells readers negatively what they should not believe; it disabuses readers of unsound doctrine.

(3) "Correction" means "setting right, . . . most likely with a reference to conduct."12 Scripture tells readers negatively what not to do.

(4) "Training in righteousness" indicates "teaching" or "education" in right living. Scripture tells readers positively what they must do.

These four items form a chiasm, with the two negative terms on the inside and the two corresponding positive terms on the outside. John Stott argues that these four terms address creed and conduct. Teaching and reproof relate to right doctrine, while correction and training in righteousness relate to right living:

Paul now goes on to show that the profit of Scripture relates to both creed and conduct (16b, 17). The false teachers divorced them; we must marry them. . . . As for our creed, Scripture is profitable 'for teaching the truth and refuting error' [NEB]. As for our conduct, it is profitable 'for reformation of manners and discipline in right living.' In each pair the negative and positive counterparts are combined. Do we hope, either in our own lives or in our teaching ministry, to overcome error and grow in truth, to overcome evil and grow in holiness? Then it is to Scripture that we must primarily turn, for Scripture is 'profitable' for these things.13

<span id="page-488-1"></span>3:17 Scripture is "God-breathed" and "profitable" so that it might produce something in the "man of God" who reads it. Some think that "man of God" refers to the pastor in particular. Such an interpretation would mean that Scripture equips the pastor for the work of ministry only, but another interpretation takes "man of God" more inclusively. On this view the phrase refers to "any person of God," though it may focus on Timothy in this particular case.14

If this second sense is accurate, then Scripture enables any "person of God" to be "complete"—"*capable, proficient* " or "able to meet all demands" (BDAG, s.v. ἄρτιος, italics original). The Bible enables all believers to be capable of meeting whatever demands God places on them by making them "equipped for every good work." Scripture states that God saves people so that they might perform "good works" (cf. Matt. 5:16; Eph. 2:10). This text makes clear that Scripture equips and enables readers for every single one of those good works. There is nothing that God calls anyone to do that he does not equip them to do through Scripture.

### *Section Overview*

At the end of chapter 3, Paul reminded Timothy that Scripture is the very Word of God. Thus Scripture must define every aspect of pastoral ministry. This is the point Paul presses in 2 Timothy 4:1–8. Paul instructs Timothy concerning what he must do if he desires to fulfill the ministry to which the Lord has called him. What makes Paul's words all the more poignant is the fact that he writes as he is about to lose his very life in order to fulfill his own ministry. Paul exhorts Timothy toward the calling, conflict, and completion of his ministry.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-489-1"></span>4:1 For Paul to "charge" Timothy adds solemnity and weight to what he is about to command him to do. Paul raises the stakes by charging Timothy "in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus." Timothy must heed Paul's instruction, not merely

because of Paul but also because of the fact that God the Father and the Lord Jesus are watching. Not only are they watching; they are also enforcing the apostle's command, for Christ will one day "judge the living and the dead"—a reference to the final judgment, at which God will settle all accounts and at which no one would want to come up short through disobedience. Paul charges Timothy by Christ's "appearing," his second coming, at which judgment will commence, and by his "kingdom," his reign over all things. Paul's protégé will answer to God for how he responds to the apostle's commands.

<span id="page-490-2"></span><span id="page-490-0"></span>4:2 Paul's simple command is that Timothy must "preach the word." This "word" includes the OT and the apostolic word (Rom. 16:25–27; 1 Tim. 5:17; 2 Pet. 3:15), both of which make one "wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus" (2 Tim. 3:15). Timothy has been given a body of revelation, and Paul solemnly commands him before God to "preach" it—to declare openly the message God has given.

<span id="page-490-1"></span>Timothy is not to be preaching his own ideas about life. He is not to preach his thoughts about current events. He is not to turn the pulpit into his platform for whatever distraction catches his fancy. He is not to make things up as he goes along. Rather, Timothy must preach the Word of God revealed in Scripture. This is his job. If he fails to do this, he will answer to God.

Preaching that Word requires several things:

(1) Readiness: "be ready in season and out of season." These seasons could be translated as "at a good time" and "not at a good time." Timothy must not stick his finger to the wind of human opinion to discern what he should preach. The approval or disapproval of the message will come and go, but this must have no impact on the content of his preaching. He preaches the Word whether listeners like it our not.

(2) Confrontation: to "reprove" means to "express strong disapproval of someone's action, *reprove, correct* " (BDAG, s.v. ἐλέγχω, italics original), seeking to persuade someone to see and turn from error. To "rebuke" means to "express strong disapproval of someone," "*censure*," or "*warn*" (BDAG, s.v. ἐπιτιμάω, italics original). Both of these terms refer to confronting error in doctrine or morals, whenever and wherever necessary. Such is the pastor's job among the flock, not because he is a moralizer but because he desires to lead people away from judgment and into life.

(3) Command: "exhort" is to "urge strongly" (BDAG, s.v. παρακαλέω). In essence, this means to command someone to do something. Such is the difference between preaching and lecturing: a lecture is oriented toward explanation and data, whereas a sermon is oriented toward command and prohibition. Preaching is authoritative, exhorting people about what they ought to believe and do by issuing commands to that end.

All of this reproving, rebuking, and exhorting must occur in a certain way: "with complete patience and teaching." A shepherd must not be harsh or indifferent toward his sheep; he must understand and be patient with them. He must commit to teaching them and to "hanging in there" with them when they stumble and fall. A pastor also must not be pugnacious. He must bring confrontation, but in such a way that consoles and inspires instead of crushing or discouraging. He cannot avoid offense if he is angry.

<span id="page-491-2"></span>4:3 "For" introduces Paul's explanation for his command to Timothy to preach in and out of season. "Time" links explicitly to the term translated "in season" in the previous verse: a time is coming when people "will not endure" the preaching of the gospel. They will not abide Bible-based exhortations and rebukes, and the reason for this will be very simple: they will have "itching ears" that they want to have scratched. They will not want preachers who inflict more itches. Instead they will want a preacher to tell them what they want to hear—that what they are already believing and doing is just fine. Those in error or in sin often like their sin very much. They do not appreciate a preacher's meddling with their consciences. Rather than listening to the Word of God that confronts them, they will look for teachers who will forgo the Word of God and tell them happy things—things that confirm their sinful desires instead of contradicting those desires. "They will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions."

<span id="page-491-3"></span>4:4 When people begin seeking to have their ears tickled, they "will turn away from listening to the truth." Sadly, they will choose to believe fiction over truth. This choice has everything to do with their preferences. They will prefer a fiction that confirms sinful desire over a truth that does not. People will follow after "myths" because they want stories that confirm them, not interrogate them. As Paul has stated elsewhere, the human condition is so broken by sin that sinners "by their unrighteousness suppress the truth" (Rom. 1:18).

<span id="page-491-4"></span><span id="page-491-1"></span>4:5 "As for you" (or "but you") indicates the contrast Paul wishes to draw between the behavior of those with "itching ears" and the behavior required of Timothy. No matter what opposition Timothy faces, he must remain steadfast and faithful in four ways:

(1) "Be sober-minded." The sense of this term cannot be reduced to the avoidance of inebriation. It includes that requirement while also being more expansive. To be sober-minded is to be free from excess, passion, rashness, or confusion. It is to be well-balanced and self-controlled. In the face of opposition and persecution, Timothy must have a clearheaded view of what is required of him.

(2) "Endure suffering" indicates a willingness to "undergo humiliation or hurts."15 Timothy must be willing to suffer whatever consequences may arise from preaching the gospel to those who do not want to hear its message.

<span id="page-491-0"></span>(3) "Do the work of an evangelist." While some seem to be particularly gifted for the task of evangelism (Acts 21:8; Eph. 4:11), the term "evangelist" should be construed not as an office but rather as a task to be fulfilled by all pastors.16

<sup>15</sup> *Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek* (Leiden: Brill, 2015), 1015.

<sup>16</sup> Cf. discussion in I. Howard Marshall, *A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles*, ICC (London/ New York: T&T Clark, 1999), 804.

The job of an evangelist is simply to be a "proclaimer of the gospel" (BDAG, s.v. εὐαγγελιστής), presumably with the aim of seeing sinners converted by its message.

(4) "Fulfill your ministry" summarizes all that Paul commissions Timothy to do in his work in Ephesus: "discharge all the duties of your ministry" (NIV). In sum, the pastor must be clear-headed, must be willing to suffer, and must evangelize the lost—all of these things—in order to fulfill the task to which God has called him.

<span id="page-492-3"></span><span id="page-492-1"></span><span id="page-492-0"></span>4:6 Paul says that he is "already being poured out as a drink offering," echoing the sacrificial language of the OT concerning such offerings (cf. Ex. 29:40–41; Lev. 23:13; Num. 15:5–10; 28:7). Surprisingly, Paul says that *he* is the drink offering; his blood will soon be poured out in martyrdom—"The time of my departure has come." Paul knows that he is about to die, and so this exhortation to Timothy takes on the gravity of a last will and testament. As Paul's ministry draws to a close and is thus fulfilled, he hands the baton to Timothy to finish what he has started.

<span id="page-492-4"></span><span id="page-492-2"></span>4:7 Paul provides two images describing how he has fulfilled the ministry God has given him: a "fight" and a "race." The "good fight" describes a competition or a contest in which one must meet opposition and overcome it. In 1 Timothy 6:12 Paul calls it the "good fight of the faith"—the fight to trust in Christ and defeat sin. Paul has given every last fiber of his being to this struggle.

Paul has also "finished the race." He did not struggle for a little while and then falter and give up; he made it from start to finish. To have "kept the faith" means that Paul has lived and proclaimed the apostolic faith that he now hands on to Timothy. He fought through until he could fight no more. Now he is at the end.

<span id="page-492-5"></span>4:8 God has prepared a reward for those who persevere to the end: "the crown of righteousness," which probably means something like the "crown *that is* righteousness." A crown was the laurel wreath placed on the victor's head at the end of an athletic competition. The crown in this case consists of "righteousness." This crown points forward to the time in which God will make his people what he has already declared them to be in Christ: righteous. Only those who persevere will wear that crown. God awards this crown not only to faithful ministers but also to "all who have loved his appearing." In other words, this reward goes to all believers who persevere.

### *Response*

<span id="page-492-6"></span>Paul's example illustrates vividly the Christian doctrine of perseverance. Perseverance is not merely the distinguishing mark of preachers; it is the distinguishing mark of all Christians. Christianity is not just about beginning—it is about finishing as well. It is not those who begin to follow Christ who inherit eternal life; it is those who finish, who persevere to the very end: "We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end" (Heb. 3:14). The difference between real Christianity and counterfeit Christianity is finishing. Those who know Christ will finish. Those who do not finish but fall away do not really know him—their falling away proves it.

### *Section Overview*

Because Paul is in prison and has been abandoned by nearly all of his ministry companions, he asks Timothy to visit him, bringing his cloaks and parchments when he comes. Paul warns Timothy of a false teacher, Alexander the coppersmith, and testifies to the fact that the Lord has stood with him throughout his recent incarceration. Paul declares confidence that the Lord will indeed stand by him even on the other side of his imminent execution. The letter closes with a conclusion very common to Pauline letters.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-494-1"></span>4:9 Paul desires Timothy to come to him. The situation in which he makes the request is stunning. The apostle Paul—the one who saw Jesus on the Damascus road, was commissioned by Jesus as the apostle to the Gentiles, and was caught up to the third heaven—now waits in a Roman prison. The picture is not the medieval caricature of an exalted apostle floating above the stone floor, wearing a halo and gently holding up three fingers. The man lies on a cold stone floor, in squalid conditions (cf. comment on 4:13), awaiting the executioner's notice. From what he says we see that he feels as anyone would feel in such a moment: alone. And so he calls for his dear brother and child in the faith, Timothy. He calls for fellowship.

<span id="page-494-2"></span>4:10–12 Paul explains why he is alone: all of his ministry companions have left him for one reason or another. He has lost nearly everyone dear to him to either betrayal or the gospel ministry. One man (Demas) deserted Paul because he was "in love with this present world." Others have been sent out by Paul to continue the mission to the Gentiles. Only Luke is left with him, and Paul clearly desires the fellowship of Timothy as well, so he calls for him. Astonishingly, in a complete reversal of previous acrimony, Paul calls for Mark as well (cf. Acts 15:37–41). In his most desperate moment, he does not isolate himself in grief or depression. He reaches out for help. He does not draw away from the fellowship of the saints; he presses in.

<span id="page-494-3"></span><span id="page-494-0"></span>4:13 Paul's request for Timothy to bring his cloak reveals the practical difficulty of his imprisonment. Prisons in the first century in Rome were nothing like prisons in the twenty-first century in the West. Obviously, they were not climate-controlled. There were no "three squares" a day. If the jailers provided anything to eat, it was barely enough to survive. "Poor ventilation created conditions of dangerously stale air, suffocating heat and dehydration. . . . Where pallets were not available one slept on the floor, perhaps using one's outer cloak as a cover against the cold."17 The cells were often devoid of natural light. Iron chains "chafed and corroded the skin over time."18 B. M. Rapske describes the despair that such conditions would have induced: "It is not a surprise that these awful conditions caused such profound distress of body and soul that prisoners, if they did not become sick and die . . . wished themselves dead or actively sought suicide."19

This is likely Paul's condition as he writes to Timothy. Among the other trials of imprisonment, Paul is cold, so he asks for his cloak. Even in this austere condition of deprivation, however, Paul asks for Timothy to bring "also the books, and above all the parchments." The rendering "above all" reflects the traditional interpretation of this text, which suggests that Paul asks Timothy to bring all of the books, but, if that is not possible, then at least to bring the parchments. However, T. C. Skeat has

<sup>17</sup> B. M. Rapske, "Prison, Prisoner," in *Dictionary of New Testament Background*, ed. Craig A. Evans and Stanley E. Porter (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 2000), 828.

<sup>18</sup> Ibid.

<sup>19</sup> Ibid., 829.

<span id="page-495-1"></span><span id="page-495-0"></span>argued that the term translated "above all" (Gk. *malista*) sometimes means "namely" or "specifically."20 If Skeat is correct, Paul specifically asks for the parchments, an ancient writing material. We have no idea what these parchments contained. The word translated "books" is used elsewhere to refer to Scripture (e.g., Ex. 24:7; Luke 4:17, 20; John 20:30; Gal. 3:10; Heb. 9:19). Howard Marshall suggests, "If there is one group of materials, then copies of Scriptures and possibly Christian writings are most likely."21 If this understanding is correct, Paul is calling for his copies of Scripture and his own personal notes. In his most desperate hour, Paul calls for the Word of God—his concern for God's Word lasts to the very end.

<span id="page-495-4"></span><span id="page-495-3"></span>4:14–15 Paul's commitment to the Word appears not only in his request for the parchments but also in his warning against Alexander the coppersmith. This is likely the Alexander mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:19–20, who rejected the faith and was delivered over to Satan by Paul. Alexander did Paul great harm, perhaps even having a hand in Paul's imprisonment. Paul warns Timothy about him not because of the personal harm but because "he strongly opposed our message." For Paul, Alexander's great sin was to stand against the very Word that is so precious to Paul. If Alexander has been a threat to Paul's gospel, then he will be to Timothy's as well, for Paul and Timothy preach the same message. Again, Paul is finishing well in the Word even in his remarks about Alexander.

<span id="page-495-5"></span><span id="page-495-2"></span>4:16–18 Paul's "first defense" should be understood in light of a second Roman imprisonment (cf. Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles: Author). If this understanding of Paul's timeline is correct, then this "first defense" likely refers to his preliminary hearing before Caesar during his current imprisonment.22 There is an echo of Jesus' prayer from the cross in Paul's words. Jesus prayed for his enemies even as they betrayed him and crucified him: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). Now Paul prays the same for those who "deserted" him when he needed them the most. He prays, "May it not be charged against them." No doubt, Paul's generosity of spirit toward those who have not stood by him is enabled by the one who did stand by him: "But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me." Paul was not utterly forsaken, for the Lord was with him even when no one else was. Paul believed that he was rescued from that moment of peril so that the gospel could continue to go forth to the Gentiles.

Because of the Lord's faithfulness to him in that trial, Paul has confidence that the Lord will deliver him from the ultimate trial of death. He trusts in God's word and is faithful to it even to his own hurt because he entrusts all judgment to God and knows that, in the end, God will deliver and vindicate him.

<span id="page-495-6"></span>4:19–22 The final verses of the letter comprise elements that are standard fare in the conclusion of a Pauline letter: greetings, personal matters, and a benediction.

<span id="page-496-5"></span><span id="page-496-4"></span><span id="page-496-1"></span><span id="page-496-0"></span>Paul sends greetings to "Prisca and Aquila," ministry partners of Paul (Acts 18:2, 18, 26; "Priscilla" is a diminutive form of "Prisca"). Paul again honors the "household of Onesiphorus" with a final greeting (cf. comment on 2 Tim. 1:16–18). Paul may mention the absence of Erastus and Trophimus in 4:20 to add urgency to his appeal in 4:21: "Do your best to come before winter." Paul sends greetings from four people mentioned nowhere else in the NT: Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia.

<span id="page-496-7"></span><span id="page-496-6"></span><span id="page-496-2"></span>The benediction is in two parts. "The Lord be with your spirit" is directed to Timothy alone, as seen in the singular Greek "your" (cf. Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; Philem. 25). "Grace be with you" is addressed to the entire church, as seen in the plural "you." Thus Paul intends his final benediction not merely for Timothy but for the entire church at Ephesus, and also intends the letter to be read before the entire congregation (cf. Col. 4:16; 1 Thess. 5:27), whom he wants to see sustained in the unmerited favor of God.

### <span id="page-496-3"></span>*Response*

At some point, we all find out that life does not always go well for us. We fall ill. We lose a spouse. We mourn. We are betrayed by friends and loved ones, and our heart really breaks. We grieve and have real tears streaming down our face. In such moments, some will feel a temptation to pull away and isolate themselves. That is not what Paul models here. In his most desperate moment, he reaches not *in* for help but *out*. He does not draw away from the fellowship of the saints. He presses in.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-500-1"></span>Verses 1–4 of chapter 1 form the opening of Paul's letter to Titus. As do 1 and 2 Timothy and other letters of its kind from the first century, Titus begins with a salutation consisting of three parts: (1) reference to the sender, (2) reference to the recipient, and (3) a greeting. Paul uses this form throughout his letters, and Titus is no exception. Paul devotes three verses to the first part of this salutation—the reference to the sender. This description of the sender is larger than any other such description in the Pauline corpus except for that found in Romans. In contrast, the threefold greeting of 1 and 2 Timothy ("grace, mercy, and peace") is shortened in Titus to "grace and peace" (*charis* and *eirēnē*).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-500-2"></span><span id="page-500-0"></span>1:1 Paul calls himself a *doulos*, a term that is rendered "servant" in the ESV and often denotes one who is a slave. Paul also calls himself an "apostle," which denotes a witness of the resurrected Christ commissioned by Christ himself to speak his message (cf. comment on 1 Tim. 1:1). Paul means to identify himself, therefore, as both a slave of God and an ambassador of Christ. Paul is not his own man; he is God's, to whose purposes his whole life belongs.

Paul is a slave and ambassador "for the sake of the faith of God's elect." God's elect are his chosen people. In the OT, God's elect were Israelites. Under the new covenant, God's elect are all those who have been, are, or will be joined to Christ by faith—whether Jew or Gentile. Paul is a slave and an apostle for their faith—he is commissioned by Christ so that those people might come to trust in Christ alone for salvation. Paul preaches and strategizes for ministry because of this group of chosen people. As in 2 Timothy, election is a doctrine that does not discourage evangelism or witness but rather makes it flower and flourish (cf. comment on 2 Tim. 2:10).

<span id="page-501-2"></span><span id="page-501-1"></span>1:2 Paul's apostolic mission is for the "hope of eternal life." His ultimate goal is not merely to convert people but to see them through to glorification, to the day when they inherit eternal life in the age to come. This "hope of eternal life" is something that the truthful God promised "before the ages began." This means that before time, in eternity past, God made a promise that there would be a resurrection from the dead. The existence of this promise means that God devised a plan of salvation through Christ before creating the universe. The very same phrase ("before the ages began") appears in a parallel text, 2 Timothy 1:9: "[God] saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began." The "promise" in Titus 1:2 is probably referring to the same purpose of grace that Paul spoke of in 2 Timothy 1:9. "Before the ages began," God promised through his Son Jesus to purchase a people for himself and to give them eternal life. Thus this would seem to be a reference to the pre-creation intratrinitarian counsels of God, perhaps even to the so-called covenant of redemption.1

<span id="page-501-4"></span><span id="page-501-3"></span>1:3 "At the proper time" God "manifested" what he had planned from eternity past: what God purposed in *eternity* through Christ he brought to pass in *history* through Christ. And the message of Christ's work—his death and resurrection for sinners—is now what has been entrusted to Paul by God's own "command." In short, Paul has a special authority to preach this message.

<span id="page-501-5"></span>1:4 Finally, Paul names the recipient of the letter: Titus. He calls Titus his "true child" in the faith: Titus is a *genuine* child not in the sense of physical progeny but in the sense that they share a "common faith." The reality of this common faith forms a bond as close as that of family. Titus is faithful only insofar as he is faithful to Paul's gospel message.

### *Response*

<span id="page-501-0"></span>Success in Christian ministry is measured not by *innovating* but by *propagating*. We are called to preach not a new message but an old one. The authority on which we stand is not our own but that of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20). To depart from that authority is to depart from faithfulness. It is never right nor safe to disagree with apostolic truth.

### *Section Overview*

Paul reminds Titus of the reason why he left him in Crete. He intended for Titus to ensure that the church was provided with qualified elder leadership. Paul charges Titus with seeing that this leadership is put in place, and he explains to Titus the character qualifications for such elders. Elders must not only have godly character; they must also be competent to teach the faith and to confront false teachers who oppose the faith.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-502-2"></span><span id="page-502-1"></span><span id="page-502-0"></span>1:5 Paul's saying that he left Titus in Crete suggests that Paul himself had visited Crete. Even though Acts 27 notes Paul's brief stop in Crete on the way to Rome, Acts provides no record of Paul's missionary work in Crete. For that reason, the visit referred to in Titus 1:5 seems to have taken place after the end of Acts but before Paul's final imprisonment and death. During that visit, Paul left Titus in Crete so that he could "put what remained into order, and appoint elders." Paul's assignment to Titus accords with a threefold pattern we observe in Paul's ministry recorded in Acts. For example, in Acts 14:21–23, Paul

- 1. makes converts through preaching the gospel,
- 2. strengthens new believers through discipleship and instruction, and
- <span id="page-503-3"></span><span id="page-503-2"></span>3. appoints pastors/elders "in every church" to carry on the work after he is gone. (Notice the plural "elders" in every single church, which suggests that each church should welcome a plurality of elders; cf. Acts 20:17, 28; Phil. 1:1; 1 Thess. 5:12, 13; 1 Tim. 5:17).2

Paul's instructions to Titus should be interpreted in light of this threefold pattern. To "put what remained into order" means to set in order the third and final item in Paul's church-planting pattern: appointing pastors/elders.

Some have viewed Titus's assignment as evidence that elders are a selfperpetuating leadership body, appointed by fellow elders. For that reason, they believe congregational votes regarding church leadership to be unbiblical. They understand the biblical pattern as one qualified pastor's appointing a new one. But that is not likely what Paul intends by commanding Titus to appoint elders.

Paul instructs Titus to appoint elders, but he does not specify in this text *how* this appointment process is to unfold. However, other texts help us to see more clearly a pattern for how qualified candidates are to be "appointed" to official church office.

<span id="page-503-1"></span>In Acts 6:3, the apostles discuss how they will appoint the first seven deacons to serve the church in Jerusalem.3 The deacons are an official church office, and it is possible that the apostles are establishing a pattern for appointment to the other church office—that of elder—as well. The apostles provide a model for us when they say the following to the "full number of the disciples" (Acts 6:2):

<span id="page-503-0"></span>"Pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty." (Acts 6:3)

The word for "appoint" is the same as in Titus 1:5, and thus these appear to be parallel situations of church leaders installing individuals into official church office. In Acts, the "appointment" to office and the "laying on of hands" are the end of a process that includes the congregation "pick[ing] out" the candidates. The "whole gathering . . . chose" the seven deacons and brought them to the apostles (Acts 6:5–6), and then the apostles laid hands on them (Acts 6:6). So the process moves in at least three steps: (1) church leadership recognizes a need for an office to be filled; (2) church leadership calls on the congregation to recognize and select qualified candidates; (3) church leadership prays and lays hands on the candidates to install them into office.

<span id="page-503-4"></span>1:6 "Above reproach" translates a Greek term meaning "blameless" or "irreproachable." The term indicates a "man [who] would not be open to attack or criticism in terms of Christian life in general or in terms of the characteristics that Paul goes

<sup>3</sup> For this and what follows, see ibid., 287–288.

<span id="page-504-1"></span>The elder must be the "husband of one wife." As explained in the comment on 1 Timothy 3:2, "husband of one wife" denotes a "one-woman man." The husband, therefore, must exhibit exemplary faithfulness and devotion to his wife. If a man is not faithful to love and lead his own wife like Christ does the church, then he cannot love and lead Christ's bride. Marriage is a proving ground of church leadership.

<span id="page-504-3"></span><span id="page-504-2"></span>The elder must also have children who are "believers" (Titus 1:6), or are "faithful" (cf. ESV mg.; cf. 2 Tim. 2:2). Using nearly identical language, both this text and 1 Timothy 3:4 state that an elder must have children who possess similar characteristics. In 1 Timothy, the elders' children must be "submissive," while in Titus his children must be faithful. Both texts denote faithfulness to a father's authority. An elder's children must be submissive and faithful and thus not "open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination."

<span id="page-504-4"></span>1:7 Paul repeats from verse 6 the word translated "above reproach" (Gk. ἀνέγκλητος), this time defining it in terms not of family but of character. Verse 7 lists five traits an elder must *not* exhibit, while verse 8 lists six an elder must possess.

<span id="page-504-5"></span>(1) "Must not be arrogant" means that the elder must not be prideful or "*selfwilled*" or "*stubborn*" (BDAG, s.v. αὐθάδης, italics original). (2) Not being "quicktempered" forbids an elder from being "*inclined to anger*" (BDAG, s.v. ὀργίλος, italics original). (3) Not a "drunkard" indicates that the elder must never become inebriated (cf. Eph. 5:18). (4) "Violent" denotes a "violent person who is a brawler,"5 thus forbidding an elder from being a bully. (5) Not being "greedy for gain" indicates that an elder must not be a lover of money.

<span id="page-504-7"></span><span id="page-504-0"></span>1:8 Paul now lists six positive characteristics an elder must possess: (1) "Hospitable" requires an elder's home to be open to caring for the needs of others (cf. Heb. 13:2). (2) "Lover of good" indicates that virtue is not merely doing the right thing; it also involves loving the right thing. (3) "Self-controlled" refers to one who is controlled not by his passions, lusts, or idolatries but by the Spirit. This term can have the nuance of sexual decency as well.6 (4) "Upright" (*dikaios*) describes one who lives according to God's standard of righteousness. (5) "Holy" is not the customary word for holiness, which means "set apart"; the term used here means "*devout, pious, pleasing to God*" (BDAG, s.v. ὅσιος, italics original). (6) "Disciplined" means that this person has his "emotions, impulses, or desires under control" (BDAG, s.v. ἐγκρατής).

<span id="page-504-6"></span>1:9 The elder must hold fast to sound teaching so that he can feed the sheep (i.e., "give instruction"). He must also have the ability through his teaching to protect the sheep: "to rebuke those who contradict" sound doctrine. Thus there is both the positive role of instruction and the negative role of confrontation. It has well

been said that "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." Elders must not be "do-nothing good men." They must be willing to confront false teachers.

### *Response*

A congregational role in the recognition and appointment of church leadership finds warrant in Scripture. Indeed, there appears to be a role both for the elders and for the congregation in appointing church officers, roles that should be reflected in the actual polity of local churches. One way to do this would be for elders to receive recommendations for church officers from members of the congregation. The elders would then pray over the recommendations and vet them for the congregation. Then the elders would bring candidates to the congregation to approve by vote. After the congregation selected the candidates, the elders would pray over them and install them.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-505-0"></span>This paragraph addresses the need to confront false teachers. Titus 1:10 warns, "For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers." The explanatory "for" introduces the reason for the instruction found at the end of verse 9, which outlined the faithful pastor's responsibility to "hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught," "to give instruction in sound doctrine," and "to rebuke those who contradict" God's Word. Verse 10 and the rest of this paragraph explain why this confrontation must take place: because there are already many within the church

<span id="page-506-1"></span>

who "contradict" sound teaching. In short, Paul is instructing Titus concerning how to deal with the false teachers afflicting the Cretan congregation.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-506-3"></span><span id="page-506-0"></span>1:10 "Many" false teachers have already infiltrated the church in Crete. This development should not surprise us, because Jesus himself warned his disciples that it would be this way (Matt. 7:15–16). While the presence of false teachers might cause alarm, it should not be unexpected. Their presence simply means that the Cretan believers must be ever vigilant.

These false teachers are "insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers." The term "insubordinate" is the same one used in verse 6 to describe what a pastor must not be. From this we see that one reason Paul says pastors must exhibit certain character traits is that false teachers display the opposite. "Insubordinate" refers to that which is "refusing submission to authority, *undisciplined, disobedient, rebellious*" (BDAG, s.v. ἀνυπότακτος, italics original). These false teachers are insubordinate to God's authority because they do not submit to his Word. In fact, they distort and contradict it.

<span id="page-506-2"></span>False teachers are "empty talkers" (*mataiologoi*; cf. *mataiologian* in 1 Tim. 1:6). Such men exhibit the kind of "irreverent babble" (*kenophōnias*) that 2 Timothy 2:16 says "will lead people into more and more ungodliness." These teachers are thus themselves disobedient, and their teaching leads others into disobedience as well, which is why Paul calls them "deceivers." They mislead people by giving them the impression they are following Christ while actually they are leading people away from him.

Finally, Paul refers to "especially those of the circumcision party," which suggests they are Jewish. But what else is known about this "circumcision party"? Paul does not provide a specific description of what this party is teaching, but commentator George Knight concludes that it is "concerned with Jewish myths and genealogies, which apparently set the tone for the way in which it handles the law. It is ascetic but also rebellious and disobedient, it opposes the apostolic teaching and turns away from it, and it is motivated by gain."7

<span id="page-506-4"></span>1:11 These false teachers must be silenced because their teaching does not address merely matters of theological indifference, or *adiaphora*; rather, they are "upsetting whole families." The only actual "commands" from false teachers mentioned in the

<sup>7</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 296.

<span id="page-507-1"></span>Pastorals are those in 1 Timothy 4:1–3, which records that the false teachers were prohibiting marriage and the eating of certain foods. Perhaps their prohibition of marriage had led to the termination of existing marriages.8 Whatever these men were teaching, it was destroying families. That they sought "shameful gain" indicates that they taught for money.

<span id="page-507-3"></span>1:12 In the first century, Cretans had a reputation for gross immorality. That sad truth is reflected in the writings of one of their own countrymen, a epic poet named Epimenides (6th century BC). Although a Cretan himself, Epimenides wrote famously that "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." The work from which Paul quotes is no longer extant, but some early Christian writers—including Clement of Alexandria, Chrysostom, and Jerome—identify Epimenides as the source.9 As a Cretan, Epimenides would have had more credibility to speak critically about Cretans than Paul would have as an outsider. Paul references the quotation to show that the Cretan false teachers behave like stereotypical Cretans. They do not tell the truth. They behave like "evil beasts" and as such are vicious and unreasoning. They are "lazy gluttons" who live for their appetites. Such behavior is rotten, and Paul says that it is clearly evidenced by these false teachers. Knight concludes, "Paul is not making an ethnic slur, but is merely accurately observing, as the Cretans themselves and others did, how the sin that affects the whole human race comes to particular expression in this group."10

<span id="page-507-4"></span>1:13 When Paul declares that "this testimony is true," he is stating that the false teachers are living up to the Cretan stereotype. This sharp accusation may have been particularly galling to these false teachers if they thought of themselves as scrupulous Jewish Christians. Yet they are behaving not with Jewish integrity but with pagan insubordination. This is why Paul instructs Titus to "rebuke them sharply," to confront them with their wrongdoing in order to convince them of their error. The rebuke must be delivered "sharply," or "*severely, rigorously*" (BDAG, s.v. ἀποτόμως, italics original). The goal of this pointed reproof is "that they may be sound in the faith." In this way, Paul holds out hope that the false teachers might yet be won over to the truth. This is not the first time Paul has spoken of false teachers with such hopefulness. In 2 Timothy 2:24–26 he writes, "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but . . . correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will."

<span id="page-507-5"></span><span id="page-507-2"></span>1:14 To "be sound in the faith" (v. 13) is, in this context, to avoid being devoted to "Jewish myths" or the "commands of people who turn away from the truth." Titus's rebuke is intended to steer false teachers away from such error. What precisely does Paul mean by "Jewish myths"? In 1 Timothy 1:4, "myths" are linked

<span id="page-507-0"></span><sup>8</sup> Ibid., 297–298.

<sup>9</sup> Ibid., 298.

<sup>10</sup> Ibid., 299.

to "endless genealogies." In that light, perhaps the myths in Titus should be understood as fictional stories based on the genealogies of the OT.11 Whatever the precise meaning, the point is that these "myths" are just that—myths. They are not true, and no one should be listening to or believing them. As in 2 Timothy 4:4, to "wander off into myths" is to "turn away from listening to the truth." Paul's hope is that the false teachers would give up on their false teaching and return to the truth.

<span id="page-508-6"></span><span id="page-508-2"></span><span id="page-508-1"></span>The "commands of people" (i.e., "commandments of men") has a parallel in Jesus' statement in Matthew 15:9, "In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men" (cf. Isa. 29:13 LXX; Mark 7:7; Col. 2:22). In this text and elsewhere, the phrase "commandments of men" refers to "what is put in the place of obedience to God and what he requires."12 Titus must repudiate this error and call its proponents to repentance.

<span id="page-508-7"></span><span id="page-508-5"></span><span id="page-508-4"></span><span id="page-508-3"></span>1:15 "To the pure, all things are pure" may seem cryptic at first glance, but its meaning is perhaps not that difficult to understand. "All things" refers to creation. The statement simply asserts that "the pure"—those who have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus—know that God has given them all of creation to enjoy (cf. 1 Tim. 6:17). The "pure" know that "everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer" (1 Tim. 4:4–5). Thus, the pure do not regard the things forbidden by the false teachers as impure (cf. 1 Tim. 4:3, where Paul reveals that false teachers forbid "marriage" and "certain foods"). In that sense, to the pure, all things are pure. "But to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure." In other words, there is nothing "pure" to the Jewish false teachers. "Their minds and their consciences" are defiled in the sense that they do not evaluate God's creation correctly. They forbid marriage and certain foods as impure. Nevertheless, marriage and food are actually happy and wholesome gifts from God to every disciple who has eyes to see the goodness of God's creation.

<span id="page-508-8"></span>1:16 The false teachers are deceptive. They "profess" to know the one true and living God. In terms of external appearances, they look and talk like Christians; their orthodox profession of faith enables them to dwell undetected among the faithful. They have all the appearances and religious performances of the faithful, but a closer look reveals that they "deny" God despite their words. Their "works" are antithetical to what they claim to believe. Their actions speak louder than their words.

<span id="page-508-0"></span>As a result, they are "detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work." "Detestable" may be an echo of Proverbs 17:15: "He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the Lord." Likewise, the false teachers are detestable precisely because they forsake the commandments of God as if they were unrighteous while shilling for myths that are

<sup>11</sup> Ibid., 300.

<sup>12</sup> Ibid., 301.

transparently unrighteous. "Disobedient" refers to their defiance of God's will and revelation. "Unfit for any good work" means "unqualified" or "worthless" to produce works conforming to God's will. Their error keeps them from producing real spiritual fruit.

### *Response*

<span id="page-509-0"></span>False teaching harms God's people. It is neither wise nor loving, therefore, to allow false teaching to run unopposed in the church. If we love God's people, we will seek to spare them from what hurts them—and false teaching can destroy them spiritually. This is why Paul says that the false teachers must be "silenced."

### *Section Overview*

At the end of Titus 1, Paul explained to Titus what false teachers look like: "They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works." False teachers have a profession of faith but not the reality of faith; their inauthentic faith is demonstrated by the way in which they teach and how they live their lives. They display an external veneer of religious devotion, but their deeds make their disobedience plain. Having warned him of these false teachers, Paul exhorts Titus to be an example of good deeds. In particular, Titus must teach and live what is agreeable to sound doctrine. Titus's teaching should focus on practical instruction for older men, older women, younger women, younger men, and slaves.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-510-2"></span><span id="page-510-1"></span>2:1 In 1:10–11, Paul declared that the false teachers are "insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers. . . . They must be silenced." In contrast, Titus is not to be like the false teachers: "But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine." The last phrase might even be translated as "healthy doctrine." The doctrine is healthy not in terms of being free from physical sickness but in terms of being free from spiritual error. Sound doctrine is the life-blood of Christian faith. It is the life-giving, authoritative deposit of truth.

Paul does not command Titus merely to "teach sound doctrine." He must "teach *what accords with* sound doctrine." Any minister of the gospel who knows sound doctrine but is unable to instruct God's people in how to live their lives *in accord* with such doctrine will not be an effective minister of the Word. Titus must be able to address believers in every station of life with practical instructions for godly living. Thus in the next verses Paul unpacks what it means for specific groups of people to live *in accord with* sound doctrine.

<span id="page-510-3"></span><span id="page-510-0"></span>2:2 Older men are to be "sober-minded." The men referenced here are not to be confused with those who hold the office of elder (cf. 1:5). The "older men" are those who literally have reached advanced age. These men must display several exemplary characteristics:

"Sober-minded" translates a term that means "very moderate in the drinking of an alcoholic beverage." Its figurative extension here means to "be free fr. every form of mental and spiritual 'drunkenness', fr. excess, passion, rashness, confusion." This is a call to be "restrained in conduct, *self-controlled, level-headed*" (BDAG, s.v. νηφάλιος and νήφω, emphases theirs).

"Dignified" refers to one "*worthy of respect/honor, noble, dignified, serious*" (BDAG, s.v. σεμνός, italics original). The dignified person is so self-possessed and in control of his temper and fears that he elicits admiration from those who know him.

Aristotle describes "self-control" as "avoidance of extremes and careful consideration for responsible action" (*Nichomachean Ethics* 3, 15; quoted in BDAG, s.v. σώφρων). For Aristotle, the "self-controlled" person is "intent on the what, the how, and the when of doing what should be done."

"Sound" usually refers to being "healthy," or free from sickness. The extension of that meaning here means "correct" or free from error. To be "sound" in faith, love, and endurance requires older men to *believe* in the right way, to *love* in the right way, and to *endure* in the right way.

<span id="page-511-1"></span><span id="page-511-0"></span>2:3 "Likewise" means that older women are to be godly exemplars just as older men are, and Paul lists some very specific attributes. "Reverent in behavior" indicates behavior worthy of a holy woman.13 There is a verbal link to that which "accords with sound doctrine" (v. 1). This descriptor calls for behavior "fitting with holiness." Paul zeroes in on two very specific besetting sins that are not in accord with holy behavior:

"Not slanderers" prohibits the verbal assassination of someone's character. Malevolent attempts to injure others with words is not in keeping with holiness. In fact, this term is one of the names the Bible uses of the Devil: *diabolos*. He is a slanderer. Slander is the Devil's work and is completely at odds with holy behavior.

"Slaves to much wine." The image of slavery is a vivid depiction of what too much drink can do to a person. This temptation can touch anyone, but perhaps Paul identifies a particular temptation for certain women whose vocation is at home and who therefore "have constant access to the food and drink of the household."14

The older women are to "teach what is good." Their steadiness and wisdom is to be a boon for younger women of the congregation.

<span id="page-511-2"></span>2:4 "So train the young women." To "train" renders the verb *sōphronizōsin*. In the surrounding verses, terms from the *sōphr-* word group appear three other times. In verses 2 and 5, older men and younger women, respectively, are to be *sōphronas*  ("self-controlled"). In verse 6, younger men are called to *sōphronein* ("to be prudent, with focus on self-control"; BDAG, s.v. σωφρονέω). Each of these occurrences places an accent on self-control and prudence, the only characteristic applied to all four groups—older men, older women, younger women, and younger men. For this reason, the verb form applied to the older women in verse 4 likely has a similar denotation. Thus the older women must not only "train" the young women but must also instruct them in prudence and self-control with respect to their duties in the home. Chief among those duties is the obligation to "love their husbands and children." Literally, the younger women must be husband-lovers and childrenlovers. Learning prudence and self-control enables these women to love their own family well.

<span id="page-511-3"></span>2:5 This verse begins with the virtue implied by the main verb of verse 4: "selfcontrol." Self-control enables the other virtues that follow. Some of these virtues are related specifically to women within the covenant of marriage. "Self-controlled" indicates "avoidance of extremes and careful consideration for responsible action" (Aristotle, *Nichomachean Ethics* 3, 15; BDAG, s.v. σώφρων). As mentioned above, this term appears in connection with each of the age and gender groupings, but the rest

<sup>13</sup> *Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek* (Leiden: Brill, 2015), 968.

<sup>14</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 306.

of the characteristics mentioned in this verse relate uniquely to marriage. "Pure" denotes moral uprightness. In connection with women, the term often carries the idea of chastity (BDAG, s.v. ἁγνός). Sexual faithfulness requires chastity outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage.

<span id="page-512-1"></span><span id="page-512-0"></span>"Working at home." The wife has the particular assignment to care for and manage the home. Whatever else she does, she cannot shirk her primary duty to care for the home and those who live in it. Does this mean that she can never leave the house or work outside the home? The analogy of Scripture would lead us to answer that question in the negative. The virtuous wife of Proverbs 31:10–31, for example, is a woman who "considers a field and buys it" (Prov. 31:16) and earns an income for her family. This virtuous woman engages in a wide range of activities, some of which take her out of the home. Nevertheless, no matter what she does, she never deserts her duty to love her husband and children and to care for the home. "Kind" probably has specific application to the wife's relationships in the home. The term calls on her to have a "generous, sympathetic, . . . warm-hearted nature" (*American Heritage Dictionary*, s.v. "kind").

"And submissive to their own husbands." The term "submissive" requires one to recognize and follow the leadership and direction of a recognized authority. In this case, the wife is to submit not to all men but to one man—her "own" husband. It is important to notice what Paul does not say. He could have said, "Husbands, subject your wives to yourselves." In other words, he might have spoken in such a way that called on husbands to *compel* or *coerce* submission from their wives. Even though that would have fit with the patriarchal context of the first-century Greco-Roman world, that is not how Paul writes. Instead he calls on wives to submit *voluntarily* to their husbands. The primary responsibility falls to the wives to submit themselves, not to the husbands explicitly to make them submit. "That the word of God may not be reviled" indicates that failure to carry out this role gives outsiders grounds to criticize God's Word, which is something no Christian has permission to do.

<span id="page-512-2"></span>2:6 "Likewise" indicates that young men are to exhibit a quality of "self-control" just like the other age and gender groups listed (cf. above) are to exhibit. Paul gives Titus the responsibility to "urge" them to be such: he has a duty to preach the Word of God in such a way that younger men understand what is required of them. Just like Paul commanded the older men, older women, and younger women, now he is commanding the younger men to be self-controlled. Paul tells each of these groups to pursue self-control, which means "to be prudent, with focus on self-control, *be reasonable, sensible, serious, keep one's head*" (BDAG, s.v. σωφρονέω, italics original). The person with self-control is one who embodies all of the virtues previously named for the other age groups in this list.

<span id="page-512-3"></span>2:7–8 Paul turns directly to Titus and says, in essence, "You are to be a model of all the virtues that you preach to the others in the congregation." Titus cannot merely teach faithfully. He must *live* faithfully. If Titus cannot live faithfully as a <span id="page-513-0"></span>Christian, he is not qualified to teach others what he himself cannot do. He must be able to say to his congregation, "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:1).

<span id="page-513-4"></span><span id="page-513-3"></span><span id="page-513-1"></span>Paul specifies three characteristics of Titus's teaching by which he is to "show" himself to be a model: (1) "Integrity" means "incorruption" (BDAG, s.v. ἀφθορία). (2) "Dignity" indicates "*seriousness, probity, holiness*"; the Latin word for this is *gravitas* (BDAG, s.v. σεμνότης, italics original). (3) "Sound speech that cannot be condemned." Although this "speech" (*logos*) is possibly a reference to Titus's speech in general (cf. 1 Tim. 4:12), it refers most likely to his teaching in particular (cf. *hygiainousin logois*, 1 Tim. 6:3; *hygiainontōn logōn*, 2 Tim. 1:13). This teaching should have two characteristics. First, it must be "sound" or healthy in the sense of being uncorrupted and correct (BDAG, s.v. ὑγιής). Second, it must be "uncondemned." This is not to say that Titus's teaching may never be criticized or condemned. Rather, there must never be any proper basis for whatever condemnations may come. In short, a faithful minister of the Word must agree with the apostolic norm and must preach this Word with gravitas and weight.

The purpose of the preacher's exemplary conduct and teaching is "so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us." Titus must live and preach in such a way that there would be no just grounds for condemnation. The preacher's reputation is not the only thing on the line: Paul refers to "having nothing evil to say about *us*"; Paul's own reputation is also at stake in Titus's ministry. A pastor cannot make himself immune from criticism, but he is to teach and preach in such a way that everyone can see that there is no basis for any such condemnation.

<span id="page-513-5"></span><span id="page-513-2"></span>2:9–10 The word translated "bondservants" in the ESV is the Greek term *doulos*, the standard term for slaves used throughout the NT (cf. comment and excursus on 1 Tim. 6:1–2). Paul emphasizes four ways in which a bondservant might honor authority, and he arranges them chiastically. Two positive characteristics frame two negative ones: "they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, not pilfering, but showing all good faith."

"Well-pleasing" directs a slave to render "positive and winsome action in addition to passive submission."15 "Not argumentative" precludes the possibility of gainsaying a master with arguments or resistance. "Not pilfering" prohibits stealing or "skimming off the top" to take that which does not belong to the worker. Slaves might be tempted to steal whatever may not be missed in "small quantities and . . . might justify their actions" by claiming that the stolen goods were owed to them.16 In contrast, the Lord's worker is called to show "all good faith." Christian witness depends in part upon Christian workers being faithful to work and to honor authority. They must work in this way "so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior." To "adorn" God's doctrine means "to cause [it] to have an attractive appearance" (BDAG, s.v. κοσμέω).

### *Response*

The Bible does not direct or give permission to husbands to coerce or manipulate the submission of their wives. If a husband ever finds himself trying to force his wife to follow his leadership, he must realize his error—especially if this is a pattern over the course of an entire marriage. He must ask himself, "Am I doing something to provoke a lack of confidence in my leadership?" The answer may be that his wife is in rebellion against God and his role for her in marriage. If this is the case, the husband can pray for her and tenderly exhort her. But often the reason she is not following is because he is being a poor leader. But no matter the reason for her failure to follow his leadership, a husband is never justified in coercing or manipulating submission. Obviously, he should never physically coerce his wife to do anything, but neither can he be verbally abusive or manipulative in order to get his way. If the husband feels he must verbally or emotionally intimidate his wife into submission, the problem is not with her but with him, and he must repent of his sin.

<span id="page-514-4"></span><span id="page-514-2"></span><span id="page-514-1"></span><span id="page-514-0"></span>The Christian wife is not called to submit to every man but to one man—her own husband. In Ephesians 5:22, God calls her to submit to her husband "as to the Lord," which means that she should view her submission to her husband as a part of her commitment to the Lord Jesus (cf. Eph. 6:1, 5, 7). For the Christian wife, the narrow road that leads to life (Matt. 7:13–14) includes submission to her husband.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-514-3"></span>"For" in Titus 2:11 indicates that Paul is now supporting the exhortations just given to specific groups of people in 2:1–10. The "grace of God" is the removal not only of judgment but also of the power of sin. Grace, therefore, enables sinners to live righteously in the present age. Jesus died to secure not only forgiveness for his people but also their faithfulness. Paul commands Titus to "declare" this kind of grace to the believers in Crete.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-515-1"></span>2:11 The interpretation of verse 11 is complicated by some syntactical features in the Greek. The one subject "grace of God" has two predicates, one of which is a verb, "has appeared," and the other of which is a predicate adjective, "bringing salvation" (Gk. *sōtērios*). English translations have struggled to put all of this together. The King James renders *sōtērios* not as a predicate adjective but as attributive: "the grace of God that bringeth salvation." The NIV translates likewise, "the grace of God . . . that offers salvation," but these renderings are most likely incorrect. Notwithstanding a textual variant that includes the article before this adjective, *sōtērios* is in fact a predicate and should not be rendered as a simple modifier of "grace of God." Mounce suggests that the verb "has appeared" functions in this clause as an equative verb.17 If he is correct, then a helpful literal rendering might be, "For the grace of God has appeared as saving for all people."

The "grace of God" refers to God's "beneficent disposition" toward his people (BDAG, s.v. χάρις). It is the favor God bestows on sinners who do not deserve it. God's favor toward his people causes a salvific transformation that would not occur apart from grace. This grace of God "has appeared"—grace's *appearance* "refers to its unique historical appearance in Christ, which is communicated to us in the gospel."18

<span id="page-515-0"></span>"All people" does not imply universalism—as if God's grace guaranteed that everyone would be saved. Rather, "all people" refers to all classes of people who find themselves converted to Christ (cf. 1 Tim. 4:10). Verse 11 explains why *all* different kinds of believers—old men, old women, young women, young men, Titus, and slaves—are to live upright lives fitting with sound doctrine: such a life is the necessary outflow of experiencing the grace of God. If that kind of transformation is absent in a person's life, then so also is the grace of God absent.

<span id="page-515-2"></span>2:12 "Training" indicates discipline: "to assist in the development of a person's ability to make appropriate choices, *practice discipline*" (BDAG, s.v. παιδεύω, italics original). The point of such discipline is to teach believers how to live lives marked by ongoing repentance and faith. These are not merely the entry way into Christian life; they are the ongoing obligations of Christian living. Repentance requires one to "renounce ungodliness and worldly passions." In this context, "ungodliness" refers to "sacrilegious words and deeds" (BDAG, s.v. ἀσέβεια). "Worldly passions"

<sup>17</sup> Mounce, *Pastoral Epistles*, 422.

<sup>18</sup> Knight, *Pastoral Epistles*, 318.

<span id="page-516-4"></span>denotes the sinful desires that produce such deeds ("passions" = "desires," Gk. *epithymia*; cf. comment on 2 Tim. 2:22). Thus grace disciplines believers to deny both sinful deeds and sinful desires. Any notion of grace that fails to turn sinners away from evil is not the grace of God as taught by Paul.

<span id="page-516-6"></span><span id="page-516-5"></span>God's grace, however, not only prohibits sin but also commands and enables positive virtues: "to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age." The term translated "self-controlled" is the same quality commended for each of the age and gender groups listed in Titus 2:2–10. The grace of God produces this virtue in *all* believers in some measure (cf. comment on the *sōphr-* word group at 2:4). "Upright" translates a term meaning "righteously." It indicates that the grace of God empowers the believer to live in accordance with divine norms. "Godly" indicates reverence and respect toward God. Grace enables and produces all of these virtues "in the present age." Even though Christians are not yet what they will be in the age to come, God's grace nevertheless has transforming effects on the sinner's character in advance of that day. Grace does not produce perfection in this life, but it does decisively change the direction of the sinner's life.

<span id="page-516-7"></span><span id="page-516-3"></span>2:13 "Waiting for our blessed hope" modifies the verb "live" in the previous verse. "Waiting" indicates that the Christian life is one of patient endurance, no matter the trial. Believers are able to endure because they have "hope." Hope is not wishful thinking; it is confident expectation that God will do as he has promised. Paul often uses the term to refer to the return of Christ and the renewal of all things that will accompany that return—including the believer's own resurrection from the dead (e.g., Rom. 5:2; Gal. 5:5; Col. 1:5, 27; 1 Thess. 4:13). The "blessed hope," therefore, is the happy confidence that every believer has regarding the return of Christ and the resurrection of the righteous. This is confirmed by the next phrase, which is an unambiguous reference to the return of Christ in his resurrection glory: "the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ." Paul's phrasing indicates the deity of Christ, who is himself called "our great God."19

<span id="page-516-8"></span><span id="page-516-0"></span>2:14 Christ "gave himself," a reference to his death on a Roman cross. That Christ gave himself means that no one took his life from him against his will; he laid his life down willingly (cf. John 10:18; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 5:2, 25; 1 Tim. 2:6). Paul assures the Cretan believers that Christ's death was "for us"—a phrase indicating substitution, "in place of us" (cf. John 11:50; 2 Cor. 5:14, 20; Gal. 3:13; 1 Tim. 2:5–6).20 Sinners deserve to die because of their sin (Rom. 3:23), but Christ suffered that punishment in their place.

<span id="page-516-2"></span><span id="page-516-1"></span>Christ gave himself for believers for two purposes—to redeem them and to purify them. To "redeem" means to free someone from an oppressive situation by paying a ransom. In this case, the oppressive situation is "lawlessness," the performance of sinful deeds. Thus Jesus' death paid for freedom not only from

the penalty of sin but also from the power of sin over believers' lives. To "purify" indicates cleansing from sin, and Christ purifies "for himself" his very own special people—a holy congregation marked by its being "zealous for good works." God's grace, therefore, is not cheap grace. Grace ensures freedom not only from sin's punishment but also from its power.

<span id="page-517-2"></span><span id="page-517-1"></span>2:15 Chapter 2 ends where it began, with Paul exhorting Titus to preach faithfully to God's people: "Declare these things." The term translated "declare" (Gk. *lalei* ) is the same term translated "teach" in verse 1. Thus Titus 2 is framed by an inclusio concerning what Titus is to teach. Paul commands him in verse 1 to teachonly what is fitting with sound doctrine. Paul then specifies in verses 2–10 what is fitting for each of the different age and gender groups of the church. He next articulates in verses 11–14 the grace that inspires godliness in the lives of God's people. It is no surprise, then, that Paul reiterates in verse 15 that Titus must continually teach "these things," referring back to the whole of chapter 2.

<span id="page-517-5"></span><span id="page-517-3"></span>Paul adds two more terms to clarify what Titus is to "declare" to believers in Crete: he must "exhort and rebuke." He must commend certain things and prohibit others. He must build up in the faith and confront departures from the faith, doing both of these "with all authority." As an apostolic delegate, Titus must conduct himself as one who has the authority to command. Titus himself must possess the character traits he is commending for others. If Titus fails to base his preaching ministry on God's revelation and on personal holiness, he will give his hearers grounds to ignore him, which is precisely what Paul is seeking to forestall by stating, "Let no one disregard you." The best way for Titus to command respect is to actually *be worthy of* respect. He must have a life of compelling holiness if he expects others to listen to him (cf. 1 Tim. 4:12).

### <span id="page-517-0"></span>*Response*

Paul's words regarding God's grace are an antidote to what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called "cheap grace."21 The "cheap grace" Bonhoeffer warned of is actually no grace at all. Nevertheless, this notion of grace has become all too common in many evangelical churches today. This is grace that promises to rescue us but not to renew us. It is grace that offers to save us from hell but not from our sins. It is grace that accepts all sinners into the church but offers no discipline for sin within the church. Any so-called grace that leaves a man a slave to his sin is really no grace at all, because grace is not merely deliverance from judgment. God's grace also provides deliverance from what makes us worthy of judgment. As Paul says it, the true grace of God teaches us "to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age" (Titus 2:12).

<span id="page-517-4"></span>We must never adopt a view of grace and salvation that essentially leaves some people untransformed. Christians ought to live godly lives, but some professing

<span id="page-518-3"></span><span id="page-518-0"></span>Christians resist this grace. It is possible for a person to have a *profession* of faith without the *reality* of faith, and such people will come up short at the judgment. We must not be this type of person. Have we really tasted the grace of salvation? We must "test ourselves" to see if we are of the faith (2 Cor. 13:5).

Because God has been gracious to undeserving sinners, Christians must likewise be gracious (vv. 3–8).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-519-5"></span><span id="page-519-4"></span><span id="page-519-1"></span>3:1 When Paul tells Titus to "remind them," he is referring to the ones who have experienced the "grace of God" in 2:11. Thus this reminder is for all of the believers in Crete. Paul explains how they are supposed to relate to those outside of the church (i.e., non-Christians). Verse 1 specifies their relationship to "rulers and authorities" (cf. Luke 12:11; Rom. 13:1). Christians must "be submissive" to governing authorities and obey them and "be ready for every good work"—which includes doing right by the government but likely refers to good works more broadly as well (cf. "good work[s]" in 2 Cor. 9:8; Col. 1:10; 2 Thess. 2:17; 1 Tim. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:21; 3:17; Titus 1:16; Heb. 13:21). Paul emphasizes that believers must be "ready" for every good work. They must resolve in advance to do God's will in all of their relationships. This presumes both a knowledge of what God's revelation requires and a willingness to do it.

<span id="page-519-6"></span><span id="page-519-3"></span><span id="page-519-2"></span>3:2 When Paul says to "speak evil of *no one*" and to "show perfect courtesy toward *all people*," he is referring to the Christian's relationship not merely to governmental authorities but to all people. He sums up the Christian's obligation to his neighbor in four phrases:

(1) "Speak evil of no one." To "speak evil" is to "*slander, revile, defame*" (BDAG, s.v. βλασφημέω, italics original). Christians must not speak ill of their unbelieving neighbors.

(2) "Avoid quarreling" means (lit.) to be "without battle." It describes a person who is "disinclined to fight, peaceful," and "not contentious" (LSJ, s.v. ἀμαχός).

(3) "Be gentle" refers to one who is "not insisting on every right of letter of law or custom, *yielding*, *gentle*, *kind*, *courteous*, *tolerant* " (BDAG, s.v. ἐπιεικής, italics original); one who is "gracious, forbearing."22 The gentle person does not wink at sin or celebrate it but is clear-eyed about sin and righteousness yet nevertheless avoids a judgmental or pharisaical attitude.

(4) "Show perfect courtesy" means not being "overly impressed by a sense of one's self-importance" (BDAG, s.v. πραΰτης ["courtesy"]). Such a person views the needs and interests of others above his or her own.

<span id="page-519-7"></span>3:3 Verse 2 called believers to love their neighbor—to do good to them. Verse 3 tackles a tacit objection that often arises in our hearts when we think about loving our neighbor: sometimes neighbors are not so lovable. Yet Christians were no less unlovable before they came to Christ. For this reason, Christians must be humble and realize that, but for the grace of God, they would be no different than their neighbors.

Paul describes the pre-conversion state of Christians in terms that describe all children of Adam apart from Christ. "Foolish" describes someone who lacks not only knowledge but also sense (cf. Prov. 15:21). A foolish person lacks both

<span id="page-519-0"></span><sup>22</sup> J. P. Louw and Eugene Nida, *Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament: Based on Semantic Domains* (New York: United Bible Societies, 1989), §88.63.

<span id="page-520-0"></span>information *and* judgment. Whatever knowledge he does have is undermined by his inability to think rightly (cf. Prov. 26:7).

<span id="page-520-1"></span>A "disobedient" person is one who defies authority as a matter of course. "Led astray" translates a term that means "*deceived*" or perhaps even "*deluded*" (BDAG, s.v. πλανάω, italics original). This describes one whose mind has not been enlightened by God's saving revelation in Christ. Rather, he is "enslaved to various desires and pleasures" (AT; cf. comment on "desire" at 2 Tim. 2:22). Such a person is bound by cravings and yearnings for pleasures that God has forbidden. Desire and pleasure are closely related. To paraphrase Friedrich Büchsel, the relation between the two is as follows: when desire is satisfied we have pleasure, and when pleasure is sought we have desire.23 In this case, Paul is referring to both pleasures and desires that are sinful.

Before Christ saved us, we were also "passing our days in malice and envy." "Malice" refers to a "mean-spirited or vicious attitude or disposition." The malicious person is not kindly disposed toward his neighbor but is malignant toward him. Likewise, "envy" has in view feelings of discontentment or resentment due to a desire to have the possessions or characteristics of another (cf. *American Heritage Dictionary*, s.v. "malice" and "envy").

The Greek term translated "hated" can have one of two meanings: "hated" or "hateful." Louw and Nida's lexicon notes both possible nuances: "pertaining to being hated or regarded as worthy of being hated."24 In any case, the term emphasizes the fact that unredeemed humanity is the opposite of lovable. Moreover, unredeemed humanity does not love as God calls people to love. It is in fact "hating one another."

So Paul depicts the pre-conversion state of Christians as one of utter darkness and corruption. Because Christians come from such fallenness, they must exercise humility toward their neighbors who now *are* what they themselves once *were*.

<span id="page-520-2"></span>3:4–7 These verses constitute a pristine statement of the grace of God in Christ toward sinners. They are rich with gospel truth. Some even believe that these verses are from an early Christian confession, perhaps something a new Christian would confess at his or her baptism.25 For that reason, some Bible versions set these verses off as poetry (e.g., NA28).

The important thing to note, however, is why Paul places this statement here. Verse 3 spoke of the lowly estate of sinners before coming to Christ. Verses 4–7, in contrast, highlight the great salvation and inheritance God has purchased for sinners through Christ. God "saved us" (v. 5), has washed away our sins, has regenerated us, is renewing us through the powerful indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, has justified us, and has made us heirs of eternal life. God did all of this for sinners "not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy" (v. 5). The point is that God saves sinners and gives them all of his own goodness not because they are good (they are not), not because they deserved it (they

<span id="page-520-3"></span><sup>23</sup> Friedrich Büchsel, *TDNT*, 3:171.

<span id="page-521-2"></span>did not), not because they were lovable (they were not; in fact, v. 3 says that they were "hate-able"!)—God saved them and "graced" them not because of anything worthy in them. Instead, he saved sinners because of "his own mercy" (v. 5). God loved sinners and cared for them because of his own character and virtue, not theirs.

<span id="page-521-3"></span>3:4 This verse details the divine attributes that make God kindly disposed toward sinners. Salvation came to sinners "when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared." The terms "goodness and loving kindness" describe the gracious disposition of God that motivates his saving purposes toward his people. "Goodness" refers to God's "*kindness*" and "*generosity*" toward sinners (BDAG, s.v. χρηστότης, italics original). "Loving kindness" denotes God's "affectionate concern for and interest in humanity" (BDAG, s.v. φιλανθρωπία). These attributes of God "appeared" not only in the historical life and work of Jesus but also in the apostolic gospel proclaiming that work. Thus, Jesus *appeared* in history but also *appears* to sinners in the gospel. When he *appears* to sinners in the gospel, his appearing saves them.

<span id="page-521-4"></span>3:5 "He saved us." This salvation occurred in the past in the same sense that God's goodness and loving kindness "appeared" in the past (cf. comment on v. 4). Jesus appeared in history, but he has also appeared to sinners when they encounter the gospel. Likewise, God *saved* sinners through Christ's redemptive work in history, and he has *saved* sinners when they by faith encounter Christ's work in the gospel. In this sense, salvation is purchased by Christ and effected within sinners in the past. This does not mean, however, that salvation is merely a past event for the sinner who experiences it. The verb "saved" means to rescue from judgment *and*  from all that might lead to that judgment, e.g., sin. Thus, even though "he saved us" in the past in some sense, there are present (e.g., 1 Cor. 1:18) and future (e.g., Rom. 5:9–10) components of this salvation as well.

<span id="page-521-1"></span><span id="page-521-0"></span>Nevertheless, in this text Paul wishes to emphasize the sinner's past entry into salvation, and he does so because he wants to highlight the gracious, nonmeritorious character of that entry. God saves sinners "not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy." Sinners enter into salvation only because of God's mercy in Christ. Salvation causes good works, but it is not caused *by* good works. Both Christ's saving work and the sinner's entry into it by faith occur as a result of the mercy and love of God toward sinners.

God's mercy gives birth to the sinner's subjective experience of salvation through Christ. That merciful experience involves "the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit." This phrase forms a small chiasm that helps us to understand what Paul means by these terms:

- A "washing"
	- B "of regeneration"
	- B' "renewal"
- A' "of the Holy Spirit"

<span id="page-522-3"></span><span id="page-522-0"></span>"Washing" refers to the work of the Holy Spirit in cleansing an individual from sin (cf. "washing" in Eph. 5:26; cf. also Ezek. 36:25–27; John 13:10; Acts 22:16; 1 Cor. 6:11; Heb. 10:22). In particular, this is the "washing of regeneration," which is the new birth effected by the Holy Spirit. This new birth effects an ongoing "renewal" by the Holy Spirit that sanctifies the sinner.

<span id="page-522-5"></span><span id="page-522-1"></span>3:6 The Holy Spirit is "poured out" on sinners "through Jesus Christ" (cf. Acts 2:33). To say that the Holy Spirit is "poured out" on sinners "richly" means that the sinner experiences the Holy Spirit fully. The salvation Jesus provides leaves nothing lacking as far as the Spirit is concerned. Every Christian receives a full measure of the Spirit's saving and sanctifying presence.

<span id="page-522-6"></span>3:7 "So that" introduces the purpose of the pouring out of the Spirit on sinners, which is oriented toward a future hope: the Spirit is poured out so that sinners may become "heirs," or "*beneficiaries*" (BDAG, s.v. κληρονόμος, italics original). What benefit do they receive through the Spirit? "Eternal life." But here Paul emphasizes the "*hope* of eternal life." Hope is not wishful thinking in Paul's usage; it is a confident expectation of what God has promised to do for his people in the future. Here the "hope" is a confident expectation of eternal life after death. Christians become beneficiaries "according to" this confident expectation. But this future hope is grounded in having been "justified by his grace." In Paul's usage, "justified" is a forensic concept indicating a person has been declared righteous by faith (cf. Rom. 3:20, 24, 28; 4:2; 5:1, 9; Gal. 2:16; 3:11, 24; 5:4; Phil. 3:12). In this sense, justification is not the infusion of righteousness but the imputation of it.26

<span id="page-522-11"></span><span id="page-522-7"></span><span id="page-522-4"></span><span id="page-522-2"></span>3:8 On "the saying is trustworthy," cf. comment on 1 Timothy 1:15. The "trustworthy" *logos* refers not to a generic "word" but specifically to the gospel message faithfully handed down by the apostles. Thus if Titus 3:4–7 were a baptismal creed, it was a creed deriving from the apostolic tradition and thus worthy of full acceptance by anyone who heard it.

<span id="page-522-10"></span>Paul wishes for Titus to "insist" that the "saying" be received by the congregation in Crete. The believers will not be able to love as they have been loved if they do not comprehend the truth of the saying. If they do not have a low view of themselves (v. 3) and a high view of God's mercy and grace (vv. 4–7), they may develop a high view of themselves and a low view of God's mercy and grace. The results of such a reversal would be catastrophic for the "good works" they are called to perform for their neighbors. Believers are to "be careful to devote themselves to good works." Such good works are "profitable for people," i.e., for sinners outside the church and in need of grace. But if the believers in Crete fail to see how they themselves have been graced, they will be in no position to offer grace to others.

<span id="page-522-9"></span><span id="page-522-8"></span>3:9 Paul commands Titus to avoid the false teaching of which he already warned in chapter 1 (1:10, 16). Titus is to avoid the bile that false teachers are seeking to

spew into the church: "foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law." As mentioned above, we cannot be sure of the precise nature of the false teaching, but we do know that it involved some distortion of God's law that undermined the gospel Paul preached.

<span id="page-523-3"></span>Notice the connection between verses 8 and 9. In verse 9, Paul says that this kind of false teaching is "unprofitable and worthless." This contrasts with the "good works" of love that are "profitable" in verse 8. Thus false teaching undermines the testimony of good works of kindness and mercy, which avail nothing if the congregation is marked by heresy and division. Thus Paul suggests the drastic measures in verse 10.

<span id="page-523-4"></span><span id="page-523-2"></span><span id="page-523-1"></span>3:10 Paul now circles back to where he started this letter: the confrontation of false teachers. The person who "stirs up division" is the one peddling false teaching—the kind of teaching that undermines Paul's message (cf. comments on 1:10–16). After two warnings, the apostle directs, "have nothing more to do with him." This means to reject the false teacher and is the same term Paul uses to command Timothy to reject false teaching (cf. 1 Tim. 4:7; 2 Tim. 2:23). The false teacher must be removed from the congregation. This is in line with Matthew 18:15–17: confront a sinning brother in private; then confront him with witnesses (first warning); then bring it to the church (second warning); and finally, if he fails to repent, excommunicate him.

<span id="page-523-5"></span><span id="page-523-0"></span>3:11 Paul explains why the church must remove the unrepentant false teacher: "such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned." "Warped" renders a form of the verb that means to "cause to turn aside from what is considered true or morally proper, *turn aside, pervert* " (BDAG, s.v. ἐκστρέφω, italics original). The false teachers are deeply flawed morally. Their hearts are not in the right place; rather, they are "sinful," indicating their liability to judgment. They are also "selfcondemned": If the false teacher refuses to repent after repeated warnings, his condemnation is his own fault. He must bear the punishment of excommunication because of his own obstinacy and sin.

### *Response*

Congregational unity in the truth and in discipline is a testimony to the grace of God at work among his people. Where division and false teaching reign, the grace of God is absent. Where the grace of God reigns, division and false teaching must flee. God has told us how to put them to flight: through patient warnings and discipline. Are we willing to do this? Unwillingness to exercise church discipline is neither loving nor unifying for a church. The longer a church tolerates false teaching, the greater the division that such teaching will sow in the church, and the more entrenched the false teacher's heart will be in his own error. It is neither loving to the false teacher nor unifying for the church to allow such teaching to flourish. It must be confronted head-on. The false teacher must be warned. If he does not respond to a second warning, the church must remove him from <span id="page-524-6"></span>membership. This kind of correction is actually the most loving thing the church can do for a false teacher—perhaps awakening him from his stupor—and it is one of the most unifying things a church can do for itself.

### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-524-5"></span><span id="page-524-3"></span>Paul concludes his letter to Titus in a way typical of Pauline letters. He includes personal instructions (Titus 3:12–13; cf. Rom. 16:1–2; 1 Cor. 16:5–12; Col. 4:7–9) before returning to a key theme in the letter by calling on the congregation in Crete to pursue "good works" (Titus 3:14; cf. 1:16; 2:7, 14; 3:1, 8). Paul closes with greetings and a benediction (3:15).

### *Comment*

<span id="page-524-4"></span><span id="page-524-2"></span><span id="page-524-1"></span><span id="page-524-0"></span>3:12 Paul indicates that he will send either Artemas or Tychicus to Crete in order to relieve Titus of his duties temporarily, because he wants Titus to come to him at Nicopolis, a port city in the Epirus province, on the west coast of the Greek peninsula, two hundred miles northwest of Athens. Artemas is not mentioned anywhere else in the NT; Tychicus, however, appears several times in the NT. In Acts 20:4, Tychicus is one of two Asians accompanying Paul on his third missionary journey. Paul mentions Tychicus in Ephesians 6:21 as his "beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord." Likewise, in Colossians 4:7 Paul calls Tychicus his "beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord." Obviously, Tychicus is a faithful gospel minister and servant to Paul, which is why he is one of two candidates for the errand to relieve Titus. Paul desires Titus to be free to come and stay with him in Nicopolis for the winter.

<span id="page-525-12"></span><span id="page-525-1"></span><span id="page-525-0"></span>3:13 Apart from his being a lawyer, we know nothing about Zenas, who likewise appears nowhere else in the NT. We know a good bit more about Apollos, a man who figures prominently in Paul's ministry. Apollos was a Jew born in Alexandria, eloquent and "competent in the Scriptures" (Acts 18:24). He was an itinerant preacher who taught accurately but was acquainted only with the "baptism of John." After being brought up to speed by Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:26), he eventually traveled to Corinth, where his preaching captivated the Corinthian church Paul had founded (1 Cor. 1:12; 3:4–6). In 1 Corinthians Paul views Apollos not as a rival nor as being deficient in his theology but as a faithful fellow laborer in the gospel (1 Cor. 3:6; 16:12), which is why Paul directs the Cretan Christians to support both Apollos's and Zenas's ministries.

<span id="page-525-13"></span><span id="page-525-9"></span><span id="page-525-8"></span><span id="page-525-7"></span><span id="page-525-6"></span><span id="page-525-5"></span><span id="page-525-3"></span><span id="page-525-2"></span>3:14 Paul returns to a theme that has been central to the entire letter and particularly to chapter 3: "good works." The false teachers have rendered themselves incapable of "any good work" (Titus 1:16). On the contrary, Titus is to show himself as a "model of good works" in everything he does (2:7). Not only that, but the entire congregation has been redeemed by Christ so that he might purify for himself a people "zealous for good works" (2:14). The entire congregation must be "ready for every good work" (3:1). They are to "devote themselves to good works" precisely because it is profitable for their unbelieving neighbors (3:8). Good works are the necessary consequence of salvation. To be without them is to be without salvation, which is why Paul returns to the theme once again, defining good works as fruitfulness, which involves looking after one another within the church in order to meet urgent needs.

<span id="page-525-14"></span><span id="page-525-10"></span>3:15 Paul sends greetings from those who are with him. Although his companions are unnamed in this verse, they likely include Artemas and Tychicus from verse 12. They may also include the entire Christian community from which Paul writes. Knight argues that Zenas and Apollos "are probably coming from Paul and carrying the letter with them."27

<span id="page-525-15"></span>Paul offers his own greeting to those "who love us in the faith." This is his way of distinguishing faithful believers from those who are disloyal to him and to his teaching. Paul does not want his happy greeting and well-wishes to fall upon the false teachers who are leading the congregation astray (cf. 2 John 10). Just as he has called for them to be isolated if unrepentant (Titus 3:10), so also he isolates them with his greeting. Paul avoids any word that could be construed as an endorsement of unrepentant false teachers.

<span id="page-525-11"></span><span id="page-525-4"></span>Paul finishes with a final benediction of "Grace be with you all." This letter began with grace and now ends with it as well (cf. 1:4). As in 1 and 2 Timothy, Paul <span id="page-526-0"></span>closes the letter to Titus with a benediction addressed to a plural "you all." Even though each of these three letters is formally addressed to only one person, it is clear that the apostle intends them to be read before the entire congregation, which seems to have been his expectation with respect to all of his letters (cf. Col. 4:16; 1 Thess. 5:27). Paul wants all of the believers in Crete to know and to experience the continued grace of God and all of its fruit.

### <span id="page-526-1"></span>*Response*

Good works do not cause salvation, but they are the fruit of salvation. We must be diligent to serve one another with good works, especially those within the community of faith who have great need. That presupposes that we know the people within our church and are attentive to acute needs when they arise. As Christians, we take care of our own, doing so as a witness to the love of Christ in our midst.

We must be very careful never to lend endorsement or support to false teachers. Of course, this means that we should not give them any financial or material support, but it means also that we may not lend them any moral or personal support, either. We must avoid the appearance of endorsing their message or of considering it benign. We do so because we want God's Word to flourish and do not wish to put a stumbling block in the way of anyone.

# PHILEMON

*Alistair I. Wilson*

## <span id="page-529-0"></span>INTRODUCTION TO PHILEMON

### *Overview*

In this brief letter, the apostle Paul writes to a Christian friend, Philemon, regarding a slave named Onesimus. He also addresses the wider Christian community of which Philemon is a part. Paul emphasizes the transformation of relationships that results when someone becomes a Christian.

### *Author*

<span id="page-529-1"></span>The letter bears the name of Paul (v. 1), and there is no textual evidence to suggest that it ever circulated without his name. Raymond Brown comments, "That Paul wrote this letter is not seriously disputed even by those who contend that he did not write Col, a letter that has the same setting and many of the same dramatis personae as Phlm."1

### *Title*

The Greek title is "Pros Philemona" ("To Philemon").

### *Date and Occasion*

The particular historical circumstances that gave rise to this letter can only be inferred from the text itself and are the subject of much debate. The broad outline of the situation can be determined with confidence, however. Onesimus was a slave owned by Philemon. For some reason, he left Philemon's household and met Paul, who was in prison in an unidentified location. At some point while Onesimus and Paul were together, Onesimus became a Christian. Paul understands this event to have transformed Onesimus's relationship with Paul, and his relationship with Philemon as well. Paul now sends Onesimus back to Philemon with the accompanying letter, which makes an appeal on Onesimus's behalf. (See the careful presentation of the information contained in the text in Douglas Moo, *The Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon*. 2 )

This much is reasonably clear. Several issues, however, are not clear: why Onesimus left Philemon's household; where he went; whether he met Paul by

<sup>1</sup> Raymond E. Brown, *An Introduction to the New Testament*, ABRL (New York: Doubleday, 1997), 502.

accident or by design; and what Paul expects Philemon to do when he receives Onesimus.

<span id="page-530-3"></span>*Why did Onesimus leave Philemon?* The traditional view is that Onesimus was "a runaway slave and thief."3 The idea that Onesimus was a thief comes from verse 18 of the letter, where Paul writes, "If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account." However, as David Pao points out, the clause is conditional, indicating a possible situation ("if"); it is not a statement of fact.4 This statement may, however, imply that Onesimus has wronged Philemon in some way. Was Onesimus a runaway slave? Possibly, although that is not indicated explicitly in the text. Paul simply states that Onesimus was "parted from [Philemon] for a while" (v. 15). What is more, Paul makes no mention of any remorse for wrongdoing on Onesimus's part or any request for forgiveness. Thus, the evidence for the traditional view is not clear, but this may still be the most likely reconstruction of the situation. At this point we must also consider the related question of how Onesimus came to meet Paul, since that has a bearing on this first question as well.

<span id="page-530-2"></span>*How did Onesimus come to meet Paul?* According to D. A. Carson and Douglas Moo, the traditional view that Onesimus is a runaway slave "suffers from one key difficulty: How was it that Onesimus just happened to run into a man in prison who knew his own master?"5

Another explanation for Onesimus's departure is that he sought out Paul as a friend of his master in order for Paul to act as a mediator between himself and Philemon. This partially addresses the question of how such a fortuitous meeting could happen, particularly if Paul was under house arrest, since, according to Carson and Moo, a home could be considered a place of refuge.6 In such a case, it is argued, a slave would not be considered a runaway. Yet there is no clear evidence in the text of the letter that Paul sought to resolve any specific matter of dispute.

A further possible way to understand the situation, which has quite a different character, is that Onesimus was with Paul because Philemon sent him to Paul (favored by Pao7 ). If Paul was imprisoned, it is argued, he would require help to ensure he received meals and other essential services. Philemon, as a friend of Paul who had significant means, may have sent one of his slaves to care for his friend in prison. Yet, on this reading, it is difficult to explain why Paul could have commanded Philemon to receive Onesimus back into his service if he so chose (vv. 8–10). It is also difficult to understand why Paul would employ the useless/ useful contrast (v. 11), why Paul suggests that the parting was not by Philemon's choice (v. 15), or why he even raises the possibility that Onesimus had wronged Philemon (vv. 18–19).

<sup>7</sup> Pao, *Colossians and Philemon*, 345–346.

There is no simple solution to this puzzle. A further related question must also be considered:

*Where did Onesimus meet Paul?* The answer to this question depends on where Paul was imprisoned. Several options have been suggested. The most common view is Rome, which ties in well with the other letters regarded as having come from the same circumstances. However, Rome was a very long way from Philemon's home (probably Colossae). It seems remarkable that Onesimus would have met Paul accidentally (as in the "runaway slave" view) or would have traveled all the way to Rome to find Paul (as in the "seeking refuge" view). N. T. Wright favors an imprisonment in Ephesus, which he infers from 2 Corinthians 1:8 and 1 Corinthians 15:32.8 This view would place Paul within relatively easy reach of Onesimus, if Onesimus had been located in nearby Colossae. If the letter was written from Ephesus, the date of the letter would probably be around AD 55 or 56.9

<span id="page-531-0"></span>In the end, there is little evidence to support any of these reconstructions, and it may well be the case that elements from more than one could be part of the true picture. For this reason, it is important to be circumspect and to avoid building any significant aspect of our interpretation of the letter on such reconstructions (so Pao10).

### *Genre and Literary Features*

Paul's letter to Philemon stands out among the Pauline letters as a particularly personal letter dealing with an issue that is apparently very specific to one individual. J. B. Lightfoot comments, "The Epistle to Philemon holds a unique place among the Apostle's writings. It is the only strictly private letter which has been preserved."11 Yet we should recognize that the letter is not simply written to an individual. Several people are mentioned in the initial greetings. Although commentators have speculated that Apphia and Archippus may be members of Philemon's immediate family, Paul describes them in terms of their place within the wider Christian community. What is more, Paul identifies "the church in your house" as one of the recipients of the letter. This is, therefore, a letter addressed to a Christian church and so, in a sense, is similar to other letters from Paul.

### *Theology of Philemon*

Because Paul's letter to Philemon deals with a specific issue in a brief, personal communication, the letter includes no sustained theological reflection. However, the letter must be read in the context of Paul's other letters (particularly Colossians, with which it shares many connections). The theology Paul declares elsewhere underlies this letter as well. Paul's approach to Philemon and his specific request

<sup>11</sup> J. B. Lightfoot, *St. Paul's Epistles to the Colossians and Philemon* (1875; repr., Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1999), 303.

is steeped in theological reflection. We can identify several important theological themes underpinning the specific issues addressed in the letter: "Although Philemon contains little explicit theology, it reflects a deep theological understanding of the renewal that God has effected in Christ and the consequences for human relationships."12 The letter is particularly associated with the issue of slavery. I discuss this issue in the next section in relation to the theme of slavery in the whole Bible. A number of other theological themes are also significant in Philemon:

#### THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

<span id="page-532-4"></span><span id="page-532-3"></span>This full phrase, commonly used in Paul's letters, is found in verses 3 and 25. Variations of the phrase also appear in the following verses: "Christ Jesus" (vv. 1, 9, 23); "the Lord Jesus" (v. 5); "Christ" (vv. 6, 8, 20); "the Lord" (vv. 16, 20). Those familiar with Paul's other letters will be aware of the centrality of Jesus Christ for Paul's life, service, and thought. The letter to the Colossians, which I take to have been written around the same time as the letter to Philemon, has a particularly strong emphasis on Christology. It is reasonable to assume that the Christology laid out so fully in Colossians lies in the background as Paul addresses Philemon. While there is no explicit development of Paul's Christology in this letter, each word in the phrase "the Lord Jesus Christ" is significant.

<span id="page-532-1"></span>Paul's use of the name "Jesus" highlights the significance of the historical figure of Jesus for Paul's thought. Following several recent scholars, the term "Christ" should normally be given its full weight as a reference to the royal Messiah and his various roles as defined by Scripture. The term "Lord" may have the most theological significance in Paul's letter to Philemon in that the same Greek term, *kyrios*, may be used with reference to both God and a human "master." Thus, in Colossians 3:22–4:1, the term is used repeatedly with reference to both God and Christ as "Lord" and also to the master of a slave or servant. It is particularly significant that masters (*kyrioi*, such as Philemon) are reminded to act justly toward their slaves because they have a Master (*kyrios*) in heaven (Col. 4:1). In other words, Paul emphasizes that masters do not possess unrestricted authority but share a common experience with their slaves of having a master who will hold them accountable.

<span id="page-532-5"></span><span id="page-532-2"></span>Many of the references to Christ in this short letter are prefaced by the Greek preposition *en* ("in"), highlighting the theological theme of union with Christ. Paul may also present himself as one who follows the model of Jesus, thus implying that Jesus is the ultimate model for Philemon. This is seen particularly in Paul's offer in verse 18: "If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account." This recalls the actions of the Samaritan in Jesus' parable (Luke 10:35). In addition, as Daniel Streett comments, "As an imitator of Christ, Paul offers to pay Onesimus's debts, if necessary, to effect reconciliation."13

<span id="page-532-0"></span><sup>12</sup> Marianne Meye Thompson, *Colossians and Philemon*, THNTC (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2005), 229. 13 Daniel R. Streett, "Philemon," in *Theological Interpretation of the New Testament: A Book-by-Book Survey*, ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2008), 184.

#### GRACE

Although the term *charis* ("grace") appears only in the opening greeting and closing benediction and so might be regarded as purely conventional and routine, we should not ignore the significance of this word for Paul's theology. In fact, that the term appears at the head and tail of the letter should make us consider whether Paul is employing an inclusio (literary "bookends") that reflects on the whole letter. The language of "grace" emphasizes God's generosity in dealing with his people.

#### CHRISTIANS AS MEMBERS OF GOD'S FAMILY

<span id="page-533-7"></span>Language signifying family relationships is used frequently in this short letter: "brother" (vv. 1, 7, 16, 20,), "sister" (v. 2), "child" (v. 10), and "father" (v. 10). In the ancient world, a clear social structure was maintained, with each position having its own responsibilities. In the Christian community, relationships were transformed without being completely erased. People would generally continue to function in their various roles after becoming Christians (cf. the "household code" in Col. 3:18–4:1).

#### <span id="page-533-6"></span>PARTNERSHIP

<span id="page-533-9"></span><span id="page-533-8"></span><span id="page-533-5"></span>The term *koinōnia*, translated in verse 6 as "sharing," might equally be translated as "partnership" (cf. Phil. 1:5). This appears to be a key term in this letter, as it is used in this verse and a related term (translated "partner") is used in verse 17. This language speaks of deep sharing in a common life and task.

### *Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-533-0"></span>The issue of slavery is addressed in various ways throughout Scripture. It is important to recognize that types of slavery in different cultural contexts and at different times in history varied considerably. The exodus narrative, fundamental to Israel's identity, is the account of the liberation of an enslaved and oppressed people. The brief summary statement in Exodus 2:23–25 reads, "During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. God saw the people of Israel—and God knew." Likewise, the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) is introduced (Ex. 20:2) with the statement, "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."

<span id="page-533-4"></span><span id="page-533-3"></span><span id="page-533-2"></span><span id="page-533-1"></span>Within the regulations for life as the people of God in the Pentateuch, there is considerable discussion of what constitutes just treatment of slaves. Exodus 21, Leviticus 25, and Deuteronomy 15 include particular case law addressing issues of slavery. Fundamental to the discussion is Exodus 21:2: "When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing." It appears that, although the possibility of slavery was assumed, it was regarded as a temporary measure due to economic circumstances that would be brought to an end. According to Murray Harris, "Jewish slaves who had voluntarily sold

<span id="page-534-1"></span><span id="page-534-0"></span>themselves into slavery to escape poverty were to be viewed and treated as hired hands, not as slaves (Lev. 25:35–43). Apparently their master had rights over their work, but not over their person, which remained inviolable because all Jews were part of a nation that had been rescued from slavery in Egypt and had thus become slaves of Yahweh (Lev. 25:42–43)."14 These texts demonstrate that, although the social conditions in ancient Israel often make modern readers (especially Western readers) feel uncomfortable, the people of God were obligated to ensure social justice to all members of society.

<span id="page-534-7"></span><span id="page-534-5"></span>In the NT, Galatians 3:28 is of crucial significance for considering the implications of the gospel for believers' equal standing before Christ. Various other texts are also significant, including the similar statement in Colossians 3:11 and the so-called "household codes" in Ephesians and Colossians. Slavery continued as a social institution in the Greco-Roman world, but the letter to Philemon and various other parts of the NT fundamentally challenged how Christians were to relate to each other within society. Conventional social structures could not provide people their primary identity, which was found in Christ alone. As a result, relationships between those now united in Christ were irreversibly transformed.

<span id="page-534-6"></span><span id="page-534-3"></span>Related to this, Paul insists that Christians are *truly* free but not *absolutely* free. The apostle describes himself as a slave (*doulos*) of Christ in several places (cf., e.g., Phil. 1:1). This implies that he is bound in all respects to his master. What is more, Paul uses the language of slavery to describe the new standing of Christians: "You are not your own, for you were bought with a price" (1 Cor. 6:19–20). Of course, readers should recognize the use of metaphor and be careful not to overinterpret such language. Paul can also speak of Christians as heirs who have come of age and are no longer under the oversight of the *paidagōgos* (Gal. 3:24; 4:1–7). But the language of "redemption" commonly used to describe Christian experience reminds us that we "also have a master [*kyrios*] in heaven" (Col. 4:1).

### <span id="page-534-8"></span><span id="page-534-4"></span>*Preaching from Philemon*

<span id="page-534-9"></span><span id="page-534-2"></span>As part of the canon of Scripture, Philemon deserves careful attention and clear proclamation in the preaching ministry of the church. Preachers may be tempted to overlook Philemon because of its brevity. (This doubtless contributes to the neglect not only of Philemon but also of 2 and 3 John and Jude in the NT and Obadiah in the OT.) The letter may also be neglected because it appears, at first glance, to make no significant theological contribution to Christian doctrine, or perhaps because it is judged (incorrectly) to address a social issue no longer relevant in the twenty-first century. Preachers should not be put off by these impressions. Instead, they should approach the text of Philemon expecting God to speak, as he does in other parts of the Bible. Christians may not always have known how best to interpret the letter to Philemon, but their conviction that it belonged among the writings of Scripture was sound.

<sup>14</sup> Murray J. Harris, *Colossians and Philemon*, EGGNT (Nashville: Broadman, 2010), 28.

Preachers should consider the *theological* and *literary* features of Philemon. So, e.g., one might preach from Philemon by emphasizing particularly significant theological issues, such as "How God Creates New Relationships in Christ" or "What It Means for a Christian to Be Free." It may appear initially that the issue of slavery has little relevance in the twenty-first century. Yet the terrible reality of human trafficking shows there is still a need for the theological and ethical perspective of texts such as Philemon concerning the essential dignity of human beings made in the image of God.

We might also preach from Philemon in a way that highlights Paul's pastoral approach in the letter. For example, we might speak about the way Paul emphasizes the family relationships he shares with Philemon; how he expresses his gratitude for the ways he has already benefitted from Philemon; how he uses the language of persuasion rather than of authority to present his case (even while his authority is subtly—and sometimes not so subtly!—hinted at); or how he makes himself open to being served by Philemon in the future. These aspects of Paul's approach to Philemon are not insignificant. I would suggest, however, that they are best integrated into a message that also emphasizes the theological message of the letter.

### *Interpretive Challenges*

We have already discussed the difficulty of gaining clarity regarding the historical circumstances of the letter to Philemon. While it is important to work toward as clear an understanding of the historical context as possible, the great difficulties involved serve as a useful reminder that it may not be feasible to resolve all outstanding questions.

Apart from the question of the historical situation, there are several issues that deserve particular attention.

<span id="page-535-0"></span>Pao quotes C. F. D. Moule to the effect that verse 6 is "the most obscure verse in this letter,"15 and possible interpretations of that verse will be discussed in the comments that follow.

Philemon presents the modern reader with the question of how to apply a text that addresses a very specific situation in an ancient context to a modern community of Christians living in a very different context. This requires care and a gospel-centered approach that interprets the text in the light of God's saving actions in Christ.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-537-6"></span>1 Although Paul's letter to Philemon is addressed directly to Philemon and is more personal than his letters addressed to churches, it is not entirely a personal letter. Paul fills his prescript with pastoral and theological content, laying important foundations for what will follow.

<span id="page-537-3"></span>Paul identifies himself and then adds a qualification, calling himself "a prisoner for Christ Jesus." The Greek genitive case is used and could also be rendered as "a prisoner *of* Christ Jesus." Paul uses the same appellation ("a prisoner *for*") in Philemon 9 (cf. Eph. 4:1). The term "prisoner" (*desmios*) appears to be intended in a nonfigurative sense to indicate that Paul's liberty has been forcibly curtailed rather than being a metaphorical expression of his relationship to Christ. This is confirmed by various references to his imprisonment in this letter (vv. 10, 13, 23). Contrast his use elsewhere of *doulos Christou* ("servant of Christ"; Rom. 1:1, etc.), which does *not* indicate that Paul was a slave within Greco-Roman society.

<span id="page-537-7"></span><span id="page-537-2"></span><span id="page-537-0"></span>Paul chooses not to identify himself as an apostle, as he does when his authority is in question (e.g., Gal. 1:1). Perhaps this is because he does not need to do so when writing personally to his friend Philemon, or perhaps he chooses not to do so for the sake of rhetorical strategy. If the latter is the case, Paul may be deliberately describing himself in language suggesting a low social status in order to identify with Onesimus, who indeed has a very low social status. Nonetheless, it is interesting that Paul chooses not to use the term *doulos* as a self-reference (as he does, e.g., in Phil. 1:1) when the issue at hand involves slavery in society.

<span id="page-537-4"></span>Paul's condition as a prisoner is qualified by the phrase "of Christ Jesus." The genitive construction can be translated in a variety of ways. For example, as Pao points out, it might be understood as indicating that Paul is a prisoner "because of preaching about Jesus Christ," "for the sake of Jesus Christ," or "belonging to Jesus Christ," among other possibilities.16 Although Constantine Campbell identifies the genitive as a "possessive genitive,"17 Pao is probably correct to indicate that it is best not to limit the meaning of the genitive too strictly in this case.18

<span id="page-537-1"></span>Timothy is associated with the letter as one of Paul's colleagues (cf. 2 Cor. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; Col 1:1; 1 Thess. 1:1), but the rest of the letter is written using first-person pronouns. This suggests that Timothy did not have a significant impact on the content of the letter; it is Paul's voice that we hear. Timothy may, however, have acted as Paul's scribe. Paul's approach to his ministry is decidedly communal, and Timothy is named because his service alongside Paul is deeply valued (cf. Phil. 2:20). Paul calls Timothy "our brother," using family language for the relationship between Christians. Although the ESV uses the first-person plural pronoun "our," the Greek reads simply "the brother," using the definite article.19 Nevertheless, Paul is probably indicating that a relationship with

<sup>19</sup> Harris, *Colossians and Philemon*, 210.

<span id="page-538-1"></span>Philemon is identified as the recipient of the letter using simply his name in the dative case. This is then qualified by a Greek phrase composed of two elements joined by "and." These two elements might be translated "the beloved" and "fellow worker." The ESV treats these as a composite description highlighting both the warmth of the personal relationship between Paul and Philemon and also the bond established by their common cause. Lightfoot suggests it probably would have been during Paul's lengthy stay in nearby Ephesus (cf. Acts 19) that he would have been a "fellow worker" with Philemon,20 although the uses of this term with reference to Christians in the church at Rome in the greetings in Romans 16:3 and 9 suggest that Paul did not need to be physically present with someone to regard that person as a fellow worker. The term *agapētos* ("beloved") may also suggest something more than simply the warmth of human friendship, perhaps used by Paul to suggest that the one loved is loved not only by Paul but ultimately by God (cf. Rom. 1:7).

<span id="page-538-7"></span><span id="page-538-4"></span><span id="page-538-3"></span>2 Paul goes on to express three further greetings: to Apphia, Archippus, and "the church in your house." These are crucial, as they indicate Paul's letter was not intended for Philemon in isolation. Little is known of Apphia and Archippus, although "Apphia may have been Philemon's wife; Archippus may have been Philemon's son."21 But we do not have sufficient information to make these identifications with certainty. Each of the individuals named *is*, however, given a further description of his or her relationship to the Christian family ("brother," "sister") or role as a Christian worker ("fellow worker," "fellow soldier"). The reference to "the church [that meets] in your house" highlights the social situation of many of the early Christian communities. They did not possess buildings, instead gathering in properties owned by their more wealthy members. The pronoun "your" is singular, highlighting Philemon's role as *paterfamilias* (the father with full authority) in the home. This does not rule out the possibility that Apphia and Archippus are members of his family, however. Paul's reference to the church suggests he does not regard his communication with Philemon as purely a private matter but rather as related to how all Christians live their lives in Christian community.

<span id="page-538-8"></span><span id="page-538-6"></span><span id="page-538-5"></span><span id="page-538-2"></span><span id="page-538-0"></span>3 Paul now expresses his greetings in a formula typical of his letters (cf. the identical, or nearly identical, phrases in Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:2). A good example of the typical introductory greeting in a Hellenistic letter can be seen in Acts 15:23, where the word *chairein* ("greetings") is used (cf. also Acts 23:26 and James 1:1). These NT examples clearly show that early Christians felt quite at liberty to use this standard convention. Paul, however, appears to have chosen to replace *chairein* with a term that sounds similar but conveys deep theological meaning. He uses the term *charis*, translated as "grace." The term *charis* indicates a gift, generosity, kindness, and favor, whether given or

<sup>21</sup> *ESV Study Bible* note on Philemon 2; cf. Lightfoot, 306.

received. In the NT, the term refers particularly to the kind and merciful actions of God in rescuing his people in the person of Jesus Christ (cf. BDAG, s.v. χάρις).

Paul further develops his distinctive greeting by adding the term *eirēnē*, "peace." This word brings to mind the Hebrew term *shalom*, referring to wholeness in all respects. BDAG suggests understanding the word as referring to "a state of concord" or "well-being" (BDAG, s.v. εἰρήνη). In Paul's usage, *eirēnē* may express a desire that the believer would experience peace with God through reconciliation achieved by Jesus Christ, and also peace with the Christian community and with society in general. Thus, through some minor adjustments in terminology, Paul transforms a relatively routine greeting into a deeply theological prayer for the spiritual and social well-being of his Christian brothers and sisters.

### *Response*

<span id="page-539-1"></span><span id="page-539-0"></span>Fundamental to Paul's understanding of what God has done for his people is the establishment of new relationships. The primary new relationship established is between God and sinful human beings. God's acts in Christ have accomplished forgiveness and adoption into the family of God for his chosen people (cf. Eph. 1:4–8). But, in a way intimately linked to that reality, Paul understands every Christian to be in a new relationship with one another. God has reconciled believers not only to himself but also to each other. He has done so in a way overcoming all factors, such as race, gender, or social status, that might otherwise have divided them (cf. Col. 2:11; Eph. 2:11–22, along with Gal. 3:28). By wishing them (or perhaps declaring that they have) grace and peace from God, Paul expresses his desire for them to know more of what they received when they became members of God's family.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-540-5"></span><span id="page-540-3"></span><span id="page-540-1"></span>4 Paul begins almost all of his letters with thanksgiving (cf. Rom. 1:8; 1 Cor. 1:4; Eph. 1:16; Phil. 1:3; Col. 1:3; 1 Thess. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:3). The use of the first-person singular form of the verb, *eucharistō*, points to Paul as the primary voice in this letter. Yet the reference to Timothy in the opening greetings indicates that he certainly would have agreed with Paul's comments.

<span id="page-540-2"></span>Paul begins by informing Philemon ("you" is singular in Gk.), "I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers." Similar expressions of constant thanksgiving, using the term *pantote* ("always"), are common in Paul's letters (cf. Rom. 1:10; 1 Cor. 1:4; Phil 1:4; Col. 1:3; 1 Thess. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:3). Thankfulness is a continual state for Paul, reflecting the attitude commanded for God's people in the Psalms (e.g., Pss. 33:2; 100:4; 105:1; 106:1; 118:1; 136:1). As Moo comments, it is impressive that Paul can say such a thing to numerous believers in various churches around the Mediterranean Sea.22 We are left in no doubt that prayer was a priority for Paul.

<span id="page-540-6"></span><span id="page-540-4"></span><span id="page-540-0"></span>5 Paul provides reasons for his thanksgiving. Specifically, he refers to what he hears of Philemon's love for all the saints and of his faith in the Lord Jesus. The structure of the Greek text demands attention. The two nouns indicating attitudes are placed together in the first half of the verse, while the two objects of these attitudes are together in the second half. So the Greek literally reads, "hearing of your love and faith which you have in the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints." The content of this phrase is very similar to Colossians 1:4 ("since we heard [or, "having heard"] of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints"), and comparison with the verse in Colossians seems to clarify the sense. While it is conceivable that Paul might have intended a double reference of love toward both the Lord Jesus and the saints, it would make little sense to imagine a similar double reference for faith. It would appear, then, that Paul intends a chiastic (X-pattern) structure in which the first verb relates to the second object, while the second verb relates to the first object (which we might represent as A-B-B'-A'), as follows:

- A. Hearing of your love
	- B. and your faith
	- B'. in the Lord Jesus
- A'. toward all the saints.

<sup>22</sup> Moo, *Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon*, 386.

<span id="page-541-1"></span>This arrangement suggests that Paul regards faith in Jesus and love for the saints as intimately intertwined. It is a commendation of Philemon that reports concerning him emphasized these two admirable characteristics. There was perhaps a measure of convention in Paul's language (cf. Philem. 5 with Col. 1:4), but we should not diminish the impact of Philemon's character. Philemon, it seems, was living a life reflecting the grace and peace of the gospel. This would have encouraged Paul to believe that his appeal to Philemon would be well received.

<span id="page-541-2"></span>6 This verse is difficult (cf. Pao for a helpful discussion of the issues23), and several matters require consideration. First, we must clarify what the conjunction *hopōs* ("so that") refers to. Most modern translations see the connection with Paul's act of praying (verse 4) and so insert "I pray that" or some similar phrase to make this clear (so ESV, NIV, NET, NASB). Then there is the question of what *hē koinōnia tēs pisteōs sou* means. Does it mean "the fellowship created by your faith" (in the sense of the community created by Philemon's and others' believing in Jesus); or "your sharing in the faith" (in the sense of Philemon's active engagement in the Christian faith); or "your partnership [with us] in the faith" (in the sense of Philemon actively coworking with Paul); or "the sharing of your faith" (in the sense of evangelistic communication of the gospel)? It is not possible to be certain. A significant clue to the correct interpretation, however, is the use of a related term in verse 17 (*ei oun me echeis koinōnon*; "So if you consider me a partner" [AT]). In that verse there is no doubt that the sense of the word is "partner." This suggests that Paul has partnership in mind here also. When we consider the use of the same term in Philippians 1:5, where the context indicates that Paul is speaking of the Philippians' "partnership in the gospel" (*tē koinōnia hymōn eis to euangelion*), the argument for "partnership" as the preferable translation seems strong. The ESV opts for a fairly neutral translation, "the sharing of your faith."

<span id="page-541-6"></span><span id="page-541-5"></span><span id="page-541-4"></span><span id="page-541-3"></span><span id="page-541-0"></span>What does Paul pray that this partnership might achieve? The ESV translation of verse 6b indicates that Paul prays that Philemon's partnership in the faith "may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ." The word *energēs* is used only three times in the NT (Philem. 6; Heb. 4:12; and with a somewhat different sense, 1 Cor. 16:9). BDAG (s.v. ἐνεργής, italics original) defines the term as "pert[aining] to practical expression of capability, *effective, active, powerful*." The term *epignōsis* (BDAG, s.v. ἐπιγνωσις: "*knowledge*, *recognition*," italics original) is fairly common, particularly in the Prison Epistles, the Pastoral Epistles, and 2 Peter. It is connected with the phrase "of every good thing." Paul desires Philemon's partnership in the faith to become effective in the "knowledge of every good thing." What "good thing" is in view? The phrase "every good thing" (which is in the genitive case) is followed by an article functioning as a relative pronoun ("that") and then a short prepositional phrase, *en hēmin*, "in us." The final phrase, *eis Christon*, has been translated in various ways due to the flexibility of the preposition *eis* in Hellenistic Greek. Paul might be referring to every good thing we have "in Christ," and it would be possible to understand the preposition *eis* in that way. Since the context suggests cooperation in gospel partnership, however, "for Christ" (or "for the sake of Christ"; ESV) is perhaps the most appropriate translation, although it should be advocated with a measure of reserve.

<span id="page-542-3"></span><span id="page-542-0"></span>7 Paul's statement indicates the personal affection between Paul and Philemon. The first part of the verse is a personal expression of the benefit Paul himself has received from Philemon. The term "joy" (*charan*) is used widely in the NT. In Paul it is used particularly frequently (as one might expect) in Philippians and (as one might not expect!) in 2 Corinthians as well. It is used once in both Colossians and Philemon. Here it is brought to the beginning of Paul's sentence, possibly suggesting particular emphasis on the word. This view may be supported by the qualifying adjective, "much" ( *pollēn*). Not only has Paul had joy; he has also had *paraklēsin*. BDAG (s.v. παράκλησις) indicates this noun can signify either the act of giving "encouragement" or "exhortation" or the experience of the same. It is related to the verb *parakaleō*, found in verses 9 and 10.

<span id="page-542-4"></span>The second part of the verse describes Philemon's impact on the Christian community more generally. However, it is linked to the first part of the verse by the conjunction *hoti* ("because"), indicating that Paul received personal benefit from Philemon *because* Philemon has brought refreshment to the hearts of the saints. This latter phrase ("the hearts of the saints have been refreshed") is distinctive. Three out of eight occurrences in the Pauline letters of the noun *splanchnon* ("heart," either as the "seat of the emotions" or as "the feeling itself, pl. *love, affection*"; BDAG, s.v. σπλάγχνον, italics original) are found in Philemon (2 Cor. 6:12; 7:15; Phil. 1:8; 2:1; Col. 3:12; Philem. 7, 12, 20), indicating the deeply personal nature of Philemon's ministry to fellow believers. The warmth of the expression is emphasized by a further use of familial language at the end of the sentence: "my brother" (in Gk., simply the vocative *adelphe* with no additional pronoun).

### <span id="page-542-2"></span><span id="page-542-1"></span>*Response*

We can learn from how Paul gives thanks to God for what he sees in the life of Philemon. He recognizes that any Christian character displayed by Philemon is the result of God's work in his life. So he does not praise Philemon, as if the good he does is his own achievement. Rather, he gives praise to God from whom comes every good and perfect gift. Paul does, however, inform Philemon of his thanksgiving for what he sees in his life. Philemon is reminded of the true source of anything good in his life and thus is directed away from any sense of pride or self-confidence. But he is able to receive encouragement from hearing Paul's recognition of God's work in his life. He also hears that Paul is giving thanks for him. In this way, Paul is able to combine theological instruction with pastoral encouragement. This provides a positive model for our dealings with fellow believers.

It is also notable that Philemon's faith is characterized by both faith in Christ and love for Christian brothers and sisters. His faith is not only a matter of per<span id="page-543-2"></span>sonal confession. This reflects the same balance between faith and love in action that is expressed in James 2:14–17. Related to this point is the clear indication in various ways that both Paul and Philemon thrive on Christian community. Paul emphasizes that he is praying for benefit from the partnership he and Philemon enjoy. He also derives great joy from the refreshing impact Philemon has had on "the saints."

### *Section Overview*

Having expressed his thankfulness for Philemon, Paul now turns to the matter occasioning his letter. Although we might describe this section as Paul's "request," it is unclear what Paul is requesting Philemon to do. The clearest request comes toward the end of the section, where Paul writes in verse 17, "So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me." Before and after that request, however, Paul employs various rhetorical strategies to persuade Philemon as to how he should respond.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-544-3"></span>8 Paul now addresses the delicate matter at hand. While we may not be able to gain absolute certainty regarding the circumstances in which Onesimus left Philemon and joined Paul (cf. the discussion in the Introduction), it is clear that Onesimus was a slave and, as such, was in an extremely precarious position. He, in common with all slaves in Greco-Roman society, was regarded as the possession of his master and, depending on the attitude of his master, could face violence and even death upon his return.24

In God's providence and care for Onesimus, however, it turns out that he had a gracious and skillful advocate in Paul. Paul's appeal to Philemon shows rhetorical skill as well as pastoral sensitivity. It would be unfair, however, to suggest that Paul manipulates Philemon. While it is true that Paul deals with the delicate situation very shrewdly, there is no reason to believe that anything Paul says is insincere or that he did not seek at all times to act in the best interests of *both* Onesimus *and* Philemon.

Paul begins with the Greek conjunction *dio* ("accordingly"), indicating that the strength of the relationship between Philemon and Paul just described is the foundation for how he is going to address this potentially awkward situation. Paul's style here is full of qualifications, designed to ensure that the communication between the two men is entirely clear in content and tone. Moo notes that verses 8–14 begin and end with Paul's desire for Philemon to act according to his free will, not by compulsion.25 The relationships between the main figures are key to the flow of this letter.

<span id="page-544-4"></span><span id="page-544-2"></span><span id="page-544-1"></span><span id="page-544-0"></span>Paul immediately inserts a qualification, asserting his boldness ( *parrēsia*).

In some cases it refers to forthrightness and fearlessness in proclaiming the gospel, but it is also used in 2 Corinthians to refer to Paul's readiness within the Christian community to confront people frankly.

<span id="page-545-1"></span>9 But Paul chooses another way. In verses 9 and 10, a key verb, *parakaleō*, is used twice in quick succession to describe Paul's manner of approach. Although this term may be used with a wide range of connotations, from a gentle encouragement to a strong exhortation (cf. BDAG, s.v. παρακαλεω), the context here shows that Paul contrasts this approach with the "boldness" he might have shown. I agree, therefore, with the classification of both occurrences by BDAG as meaning "to make a strong request for someth., *request, implore, entreat*," with "strength" understood as a matter of passion rather than of authority (italics original). The appeal Paul makes is "on account of [*dia* followed by the accusative] love." Paul does not specify whose love he refers to here. There is scope for a breadth of understanding that would include the love between Paul and Philemon, between Paul and Onesimus, and within the Christian community.

Paul's reference to his age is intriguing. There is a textual question regarding whether the reading should be "ambassador" (a difference of only one letter in Gk.), but the reading "old man" appears to fit the context better (cf. Moo26 and Metzger27). The whole passage suggests that Paul is appealing repeatedly to the value Philemon places on relationships and Christian love. Paul's reference to himself as an aged prisoner fits that context well.

<span id="page-545-4"></span><span id="page-545-3"></span><span id="page-545-2"></span>10 Paul speaks of Onesimus as his "child," adding the explanation, "whose father I became in chains" (AT). Onesimus is described in verses 10–13 using three relative clauses beginning with the relative pronoun *hon*. The first clause (v. 10b) describes a birth: "whose father I became." The new birth Paul speaks of here, while not explained, indicates a spiritual transformation accomplished by God, with Paul acting as agent (cf. 1 Cor. 4:15).

<span id="page-545-5"></span><span id="page-545-0"></span>11 Further elaboration of this relative clause describing Onesimus is provided by a parenthetical clause. Here Paul makes the well-known word play on Onesimus's name, which means "useful." Paul uses two adjectives, *achrēstos* ("useless") and *euchrēstos* ("useful"), related to the meaning of Onesimus's name to indicate that the spiritual transformation of Onesimus has not only fundamentally changed his character and relationship with Paul but has also transformed his relationship with Philemon. Pao suggests that it is not necessary to read "useless" in a particularly negative light, beyond a general contrast between the past and the present.28 If, however, Onesimus is understood to be a runaway slave, then the play on words becomes more relevant.

<span id="page-545-6"></span>12 The second relative clause describes Paul's sacrificial act in sending Onesimus back to Philemon. The depth of the relationship between Paul and Onesimus is

<span id="page-546-0"></span>expressed by the term *splanchna* ("heart"), the second of its three occurrences in this short letter (vv. 7, 12, 20; cf. comment on verse 7). It is remarkable that Paul can describe this new Christian brother, who comes from a very different social context than Paul the Roman citizen, as one who *is* his "very heart."

<span id="page-546-1"></span>13 The third relative clause describes Paul's desire to keep Onesimus with him. Paul appears to acknowledge that this would not be a normal situation. The purpose (expressed by *hina*, "in order that") of Paul's desire is that Onesimus might "serve" (*diakonē*) Paul on Philemon's behalf (*hyper sou*). It is striking that Paul comments on how Onesimus might have acted on Philemon's behalf, even though Philemon was a master who had slaves to serve him. This gets to the heart of the distinctive ethic of servanthood lying at the heart of Christian community.

<span id="page-546-2"></span>14 Paul has clearly and fully expressed his desire to keep Onesimus. Now he indicates that he has subordinated his personal wishes to the good of Philemon, so that Philemon might have an opportunity to do a good act (*to agathon sou*) freely. This attitude models the concern for the good of others that Paul has seen in Philemon previously (v. 7) and that he will now ask Philemon to show with respect to Onesimus.

<span id="page-546-3"></span>15 Paul speculates (using the cautious expression, *tacha*, "perhaps") regarding the situation. Paul's words do not permit us to clarify the precise circumstances of the parting of Onesimus and Philemon, but Paul reads these circumstances in the context of God's sovereign providence, knowing the circumstances have a distinct purpose. That purpose, suggests Paul, is for a temporary parting to be replaced by an eternal togetherness. This short statement is nicely balanced, the verb *echōristhē* ("parted") corresponding to *apechēs* ("have back") and the temporal phrase *pros hōran*  ("for a while") corresponding to *aiōnion* ("forever").

<span id="page-546-4"></span>16 This verse qualifies the apparent balance of verse 15, adding an element of discontinuity to the new situation. The designation "bondservant" was once the appropriate description of Onesimus, but that is no longer the case; now he is a "beloved brother." Onesimus is already a beloved brother to Paul, even if to nobody else ("especially to me"). This is a matter not simply of a subjective change of attitude but of a new birth. Paul now offers Philemon the opportunity to embrace that reality in his relationship to Onesimus, a relationship that, according to Paul, should be all the more transformed.

<span id="page-546-5"></span>17 The connective particle *oun* ("so") marks "continuity and development."29 Paul builds on what he has said so far but also pushes a little further with the only clear request (in fact, a command) in the letter: "Receive him [Onesimus] as me" (AT). This imperative is introduced by a conditional clause beginning with *ei*. In grammatical terms, this is a "first class" condition. The ESV is correct to translate this as a true condition: "If you consider me your partner." The first class condition construc-

<span id="page-547-4"></span>tion assumes the truth of the statement in the first clause (the protasis) *for the sake of argument*. That is to say, the protasis may or may not be correct in actual fact but is assumed to be so in the context of the discussion. As Paul has already referred to Philemon's partnership (v. 6), we can be confident he indeed believes Philemon to be his partner. However, the conditional construction challenges Philemon to draw for himself the appropriate conclusions regarding how he should now act.

<span id="page-547-6"></span><span id="page-547-1"></span>18 The conditional clause in verse 18 should also be treated as a real condition. The use of the first class conditional construction in Luke 11:19 (where Jesus says, "If I cast out demons by Beelzebul . . .") should put an end to the notion that the first class condition always assumes a factually true statement. Rather, it assumes a statement to be true *for the sake of argument*. While the grammar itself does not necessitate the conclusion that Onesimus owes a debt (cf. Moo30), the fact that Paul raises this issue may suggest he believes Onesimus does. His request that Philemon should charge any debt to Paul's account recalls the words (in sentiment, not in precise terminology) of the Samaritan in Jesus' parable (Luke 10:35). It is doubtless a genuine commitment on Paul's part.

<span id="page-547-7"></span><span id="page-547-3"></span><span id="page-547-2"></span><span id="page-547-0"></span>19 Paul's personal commitment is established by his own handwriting. This comment is similar to that of Galatians 6:11. Such references suggest strongly that Paul's normal practice was to have his letters physically written by a scribe (an "amanuensis"). This can be seen most vividly in Romans 16:22, where Tertius, "who wrote this letter," greets the readers with a direct address from the final page of Paul's letter. As Paul emphasizes his identity and personal commitment to provide for Onesimus, he also takes the opportunity to remind Philemon that his debt to Paul is far greater. That Philemon owes Paul "even [his] own self" implies that Paul was also the means by which Philemon came to faith in Christ and thus was his "spiritual father" as well.

<span id="page-547-8"></span><span id="page-547-5"></span>20 Just when Paul might be regarded as exerting considerable emotional pressure on Philemon, the tone changes markedly. Paul addresses him directly as "brother" and expresses a desire to experience refreshment from him, recalling the words of verse 7. By using this expression, Paul places himself in a position of dependence on Philemon. It seems this both reflects the reality of Paul's relationship with Philemon and serves a valuable rhetorical function at this critical point in the letter.

<span id="page-547-9"></span>21 Paul now expresses his confidence in Philemon's response of "obedience" or "compliance," further demonstrating the depth of their relationship. Paul is confident Philemon will do "even more" than he asks. Does he imply that Philemon should free Onesimus? Although this is an inference drawn by a number of commentators, it remains no more than an inference. Paul provides no further clues regarding what he may have meant by this expression, and interpreters should be careful not to put words into Paul's mouth. That said, the broad implication of everything Paul has said in this section of the letter is that God has accomplished something so significant in the life of Onesimus (and, indeed, in Philemon's life as well) that no human relationship could remain unaffected.

### *Response*

<span id="page-548-0"></span>Paul's appeal to Philemon appears to boil down to this: "Receive Onesimus [not according to what he deserves but now] as a Christian brother, just as you would receive me" (cf. vv. 16–17). This demands a remarkable commitment from Philemon to prioritize his Christian relationship to Onesimus over all expectations of society. Such commitment remains a fundamental issue for Christian believers in all parts of the world today. It is one thing to acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord in our own lives. It is another to acknowledge that every person brought into the Christian church by God's grace also becomes a member of our family, someone to whom we are obligated. Many Christians live in social circumstances challenging this reality, whether because of racial prejudice or caste structures or class systems or socioeconomic circumstances. But the calling of every Christian is to receive any Christian from any circumstances in just the same way as he would receive his dearest friend. Only grace can bring about such recognition of how we have been accepted in Christ, enabling us to show such acceptance to others. And only the power of Christ at work in us can enable us to live out such a desire.

### <span id="page-548-1"></span>PHILEMON 22–25

At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you. Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-549-7"></span>22 The final verses of this short letter are dominated by mention of positive relationships. I include verse 22 with the following verses because it highlights such a relationship. Paul asks Philemon to prepare a guest room (*xenia*) for him. This is quite a remarkable request for a prisoner to make! Did Paul know he would be released shortly, or is this an expression of faith? We do not have any evidence to confirm whether or not Paul's intentions were realized. Perhaps his reference to Philemon's prayers and the possibility that Paul might be "graciously given to" Philemon suggest optimism regarding future liberty. Perhaps they also hint that Philemon has already indicated his desire for Paul to visit him.

<span id="page-549-8"></span><span id="page-549-3"></span><span id="page-549-2"></span>23 The reference to Epaphras ties this letter closely to the letter to the Colossians, in which Epaphras is mentioned in 1:7 and 4:12. These are the only references to Epaphras in Paul's letters, yet we learn significant things about his character: Epaphras shared the gospel with the Colossians (Col. 1:7); he spoke positively about the Colossians to Paul (Col. 1:8); he was from Colossae (Col. 4:12); he is characterized as a "servant," or perhaps "slave," of Christ Jesus (4:12); he struggles for the Colossians in prayer (4:12); he worked hard on behalf of the Christians at Colossae and also at Laodicea and Hierapolis (4:13). Finally, Paul describes him here as a "fellow prisoner" (*synaichmalōtos*). Although Paul employs a different word here than the one used of himself in 1:1, we can assume both terms refer to the same imprisonment.

<span id="page-549-9"></span><span id="page-549-4"></span><span id="page-549-1"></span>24 The verb *aspazetai* ("greets"; v. 23) is singular and appears to relate primarily to Epaphras. The names of Paul's other four colleagues (v. 24) are simply appended after the description of Epaphras, however, so it is clear that the same verb is to be applied to them as well. Although a common name might well apply to more than one person, the NT writers generally provide some kind of clarification when there might be confusion. Thus, the names of Mark and Luke, without further detail, almost certainly refer to the men well known from other parts of the NT with the same names. Aristarchus is less well known, although he is mentioned in Acts 19:29 as a Macedonian companion of Paul. The name "Demas" introduces a somber note since this is probably the same person to whom Paul refers in 2 Timothy 4:10 as having deserted him.

<span id="page-549-10"></span><span id="page-549-6"></span><span id="page-549-5"></span><span id="page-549-0"></span>25 The final benediction repeats the emphasis on grace found in verse 3 and is a short variation on Paul's regular benediction. While Paul is consistent in praying for grace for his Christian brothers and sisters, the precise form of his blessings varies.

### *Response*

Although the closing verses of this short letter may appear to be rather mundane, they in fact reflect the theological heart of the gospel. In Jesus Christ, God creates a new humanity, in which those who were once estranged are now reconciled and brought into a new family. This new relationship will flourish only when it is nurtured. Christians should spend time together, pray for one another, show care for one another, and seek the Lord's blessing on one another.

In these final words, Paul models the kind of healthy Christian relationship he desires for Philemon and Onesimus. But the (apparently) sad case of Demas alerts us to our responsibility to be those who foster relationships in the Christian community instead of rupturing them. A more hopeful note is Paul's mention of Mark; their relationship had also been ruptured, but the possibility of restoration remained. The sad tale of Demas does not have the last word. Nor, indeed, does the tale of Onesimus and Philemon, the conclusion of which we do not know. The last word is a word of grace in the Lord Jesus Christ, who has accomplished ultimate reconciliation with us (cf. Col. 1:20–21). As believers seek to live out their union with Christ, they may pray with hope that their human relationships will be characterized by that same reconciliation.
