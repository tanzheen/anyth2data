#### TO THE ESV EXPOSITORY COMMENTARY

The Bible pulsates with life, and the Spirit conveys the electrifying power of Scripture to those who lay hold of it by faith, ingest it, and live by it. God has revealed himself in the Bible, which makes the words of Scripture sweeter than honey, more precious than gold, and more valuable than all riches. These are the words of life, and the Lord has entrusted them to his church, for the sake of the world.

He has also provided the church with teachers to explain and make clear what the Word of God means and how it applies to each generation. We pray that all serious students of God's Word, both those who seek to teach others and those who pursue study for their own personal growth in godliness, will be served by the ESV Expository Commentary. Our goal has been to provide a clear, crisp, and Christ-centered explanation of the biblical text. All Scripture speaks of Christ (Luke 24:27), and we have sought to show how each biblical book helps us to see the "light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6).

To that end, each contributor has been asked to provide commentary that is:

- *exegetically sound*—self-consciously submissive to the flow of thought and lines of reasoning discernible in the biblical text;
- *biblically theological*—reading the Bible as diverse yet bearing an overarching unity, narrating a single storyline of redemption culminating in Christ;
- *globally aware*—aimed as much as possible at a global audience, in line with Crossway's mission to provide the Bible and theologically responsible resources to as many people around the world as possible;
- *broadly reformed*—standing in the historical stream of the Reformation, affirming that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, taught in Scripture alone, for God's glory alone; holding high a big God with big grace for big sinners;
- *doctrinally conversant*—fluent in theological discourse; drawing appropriate brief connections to matters of historical or current theological importance;
- *pastorally useful*—transparently and reverently "sitting under the text"; avoiding lengthy grammatical/syntactical discussions;
- *application-minded*—building brief but consistent bridges into contemporary living in both Western and non-Western contexts (being aware of the globally diverse contexts toward which these volumes are aimed);

• *efficient in expression*—economical in its use of words; not a word-byword analysis but a crisply moving exposition.

In terms of Bible translation, the ESV is the base translation used by the authors in their notes, but the authors were expected to consult the text in the original languages when doing their exposition and were not required to agree with every decision made by the ESV translators.

As civilizations crumble, God's Word stands. And we stand on it. The great truths of Scripture speak across space and time, and we aim to herald them in a way that will be globally applicable.

May God bless the study of his Word, and may he smile on this attempt to expound it.

## INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY

#### *Overview*

<span id="page-21-1"></span>Deuteronomy is a narrative reporting the words of Moses as delivered in three addresses to Israel in the Jordan Valley just prior to his death. Moses could not cross the river to stand in the Promised Land (Deut. 3:23–29). Instead, he would commission Joshua as his successor to lead the people into the realization of the promises God made to the patriarchs. The book concludes with an epilogue in chapters 31–34—a short account of the last words and deeds of Moses, the succession of Joshua, and the provision for the continuity of the Torah given by Moses via a copy placed in the ark in the custody of the priests and a song of Moses taught by memory to the people.

<span id="page-21-6"></span><span id="page-21-5"></span><span id="page-21-4"></span><span id="page-21-2"></span>Deuteronomy contains a diversity of material. The book ranges from the very words spoken by Moses in the receiving of the covenant (5:1) to the written Torah, which was to be carried by the priests responsible for the transportation of the ark containing the covenant (31:9) and other incidental historical objects. The book draws on sources apart from the Torah, such as the lengthy poems found in chapters 32–33. Deuteronomy is not a mere repetition of the previous giving of the covenant at Sinai. It is a reaffirmation of that covenant, given as a guide to enable the tribes to live together when they enter the land they are about to inherit. The book places a great deal of focus on the one central place of worship and the annual pilgrimages all the tribes are to make, but it contains very little description of the actual ceremonies or rituals required at the tabernacle. Instead, it presents a strong emphasis on the care of the needy and the marginalized. Love and fear of God required in the covenant is shown through justice and harmony in the community.

<span id="page-21-3"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>The book of Deuteronomy has been helpfully described as the "Gospel according to Moses."1 It offers the most systematic presentation of theology in the entire OT. The book functions as a manifesto calling on Israel to respond to God's grace with fear and love (10:12). True love for the Lord brings a fear that one might have taken the name of the Lord in vain in entering the covenant. It is tragic to be unfaithful to that commitment and thus suffer the curse of covenant violation. Love and fear together enable the people to walk in all of God's ways and to serve

<sup>1</sup> Cf. the book of this title by Daniel I. Block, in which he provides theological and ethical reflections on the book of Deuteronomy (Eugene, OR: Cascade, 2012).

him with a devoted mind. It is not outward circumcision that is fundamental but rather what that rite represents, namely, a circumcision of the heart that speaks of an uncompromising commitment to the covenant vow (10:16).

<span id="page-22-2"></span><span id="page-22-0"></span>Such love begins with a proper understanding of the person of God. The revelation at Mount Sinai brought to Israel the One who alone is worthy to be called God; there Israel learned that there can be no other God (4:35–39). This declaration emerged as a crescendo from the description of the blazing fire that flamed brilliantly into the heart of heaven, piercing the thick darkness. The import of this sermon of Moses is that the One who made a covenant with them at Sinai is incomparable to any other being. This is a proper understanding of the Holy One. This God is independent of all that is common; he is set apart from the material world. It must be clear that everything within the common is dependent on him, but he is in no sense dependent on the common—in contrast to all other gods or beings. Such a concept of divinity is otherwise unknown in ancient times. This knowledge of God is nothing less than a gracious gift to Israel, a grace and mercy that began with their fathers. Knowing this God revealed in the burning mountain is the essence of the mandate to love and fear him. Such knowledge of God will enable Israel to live with a circumcised heart.

<span id="page-22-1"></span>The total requirement of the covenant is stated in what is known as the great Shema (6:4–5). The Shema is the command to hear the words that state what Israel must know. Every person of the covenant must love God with all of his mind, desire, and wealth (as explained in the exegesis of these verses). Love cannot be reduced to a feeling or some general notion of doing what is right. It is defined in the Ten Words of revelation that begin with confession of the one God and allegiance to him through an oath. This confession is demonstrated in stated life values, beginning with honor of Sabbath, parents, life, marriage, property, and truth. These must not be violated by so much as a wrong desire for another's wife or property. These requirements are expanded through an exposition of community life. This will include a unified confession of all the tribes making pilgrimage to one central place three times a year. It will be protected by purging from the community all who teach some other allegiance. It will be observed in daily practices of foods eaten, in making provision for the vulnerable members of the tribes, and in establishing the necessary judicial and educational institutions necessary to maintain good order.

In the instructions of the written Torah of Moses is provision for dealing with the various contingencies that in due course will affect the life of the tribes in the land. These include times of war, protection of property, provision for families in times of death and disruption, and maintenance of good order when disrupted by unruly and ruthless individuals. Observance of the covenant will bring blessings; conversely, failure to love God will bring the consequences of the curses.

The requirements of the covenant are concluded with provisions for renewal and continuity. Moses will no longer be present to mediate the words of God. Instead, they are written down and are to be repeated every seven years at the <span id="page-23-2"></span>place God will choose for all Israel to worship. The book of this Torah will be stored permanently in the ark; its presence there makes this chest the ark of the covenant. It will forever be known as the footstool of the great King (cf. 1 Chron. 28:2), the One who created Israel and gave them the mandate to be a kingdom of priests among all the nations. The covenant at Sinai will become the enduring instruction of how Israel will love God and their neighbor.

<span id="page-23-0"></span>The book of Deuteronomy is thus both a conclusion to the books of Moses and a foundation for the words of the prophets. It brings Israel to the initiation of its inheritance of the Promised Land. The covenant at Sinai is renewed, and the promises to the patriarchs have begun to be realized. The book brings to conclusion the life of Moses and provides a transition to the new generation under Joshua. This will be the generation that will enter the promised rest (Deut. 3:20), and this book provides the instructions that will make that territory a land of rest. The prophets who write the narrative of Israel from Joshua through Kings evaluate the nation in terms of the words of this covenant. The great prophets of Israel, especially Isaiah and Jeremiah, use Deuteronomy as the source of their instruction to Israel.

#### *Title*

The popular Hebrew name for Deuteronomy is *Sefer Devarim* ("scroll of words"), an abbreviation of *'elleh haddebarim* ("these are the words") This title is simply the first two words of the book, the standard Hebrew way of naming books. A second way of rendering the title is "the repetition of the Torah," which appears frequently in rabbinic literature. Although Deuteronomy is in one sense a repetition of the covenant introduced at Sinai, this version of the covenant displays a significantly different emphasis. Exodus and Leviticus are concerned mostly with the tabernacle, its construction, and its ritual. The tabernacle is part of Deuteronomy only by inference, which emphasizes the one place of worship but contains nothing of the ritual that should take place there. Thus Deuteronomy is not a simple repetition.

Deuteronomy is the conclusion of a single entity constituting the first section of the Hebrew canon known as the Torah, which refers to the teaching or instruction received at Sinai. This is an appropriate title, since these books not only introduce the people of faith to the Creator and his creation but also place most of their focus on the instruction of the covenant, which governs how people are to relate to God and to each other.

<span id="page-23-1"></span>The name "Deuteronomy" is based on the Greek translation of Deuteronomy 17:18. However, as a name it could convey a somewhat distorted concept of the book. This passage concerns instructions to the king, where he is told in Hebrew to have at his side *mishneh hatorah hazoʾt* (a "copy of this instruction"). The translation of this phrase for Greek-speaking Jews was rendered as *to deuteronomion touto*, which could be read as "this second law." Standing alone, the term could convey the sense of a "second law" rather than a commitment to the law as demonstrated by a readily available copy. As is the case with most of the books of the OT, names in the Greek version were extended through the Latin Vulgate into English translations.

#### *Author*

Traditionally both Jews and Christians have accepted Deuteronomy to be written by Moses. The German translation of Martin Luther named the books of the Pentateuch in numerical sequence as books of Moses; Deuteronomy is *das fünfte Buch Mose* ("the Fifth Book of Moses"). The predominant view in Judaism before the time of Christ was that God dictated the entire Torah to Moses. However, since the times of the Talmud and the Fathers, about three hundred years after Christ, sages have held the matter to be more complex than that. The account of the death of Moses in Deuteronomy 34:5–12 is unlikely to have been written by Moses. The note that the burial place of Moses is not known "to this day" (v. 6), an expression found five other times in Deuteronomy (2:22; 3:14; 10:8; 11:4; 29:4), suggests that the account was written in final form sometime after Moses. This expression is found fifty-five times in the books of Deuteronomy through 2 Kings, which may be an indication of the time when scribes gave final form to these writings.

<span id="page-24-8"></span><span id="page-24-7"></span><span id="page-24-6"></span><span id="page-24-0"></span>In accordance with ancient Near Eastern literary practice, the book of Deuteronomy presents itself as anonymous; no author is given for the book within its pages. It is written in the third person as an account reporting the words and actions Moses, which are sometime in the first person. And yet the book of Deuteronomy tells us more about its composition than does any other book of the OT. Deuteronomy 31:9–13 declares that Moses wrote "this law [Torah]," which the book itself identifies as the longest section, constituting most of the second speech of Moses (4:44–28:68). This written document was placed in the custody of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant. There are numerous references to the written Torah (6:6–9; 11:18–21; 17:18–20; 28:58), all of which point to an early transcription of the teaching that Moses delivered in oral form on the fields of Moab.

<span id="page-24-9"></span><span id="page-24-2"></span><span id="page-24-1"></span>According to biblical testimony, some version of the Torah came across the Jordan with Joshua and the Israelites. The Israelites are exhorted to be resolute and courageous as they enter the Promised Land, with the assurance that the promise of God cannot fail so long as they are faithful to the words of the Torah (Josh. 1:5–9). Joshua faithfully carries out the renewal of the covenant according to the words of the Torah once Israel has crossed the Jordan (8:30–35) and taken possession of the land (23:3–6; 24:24–26). At minimum, this must have consisted of the largest part of the second speech of Moses.

<span id="page-24-11"></span><span id="page-24-10"></span><span id="page-24-5"></span><span id="page-24-4"></span><span id="page-24-3"></span>These instructions of Moses continued as an authoritative word through the work of scribes. The teaching of Deuteronomy is the basis of covenant evaluation in the sequel of prophetic words to Israel. Joshua and Judges are characterized by the concerns of Deuteronomy. Two accounts of the death of Joshua explain the themes of covenant fulfillment and failure (Josh. 24:29–31; Judg. 2:6–10). The instruction of Deuteronomy concerning the proper role of a king is evident as Samuel warns the nation how kings of the other nations rule (1 Sam. 8:11–18). Deuteronomy warns against the building of armies and a royal elite (Deut. 17:14–20), a sin committed by most of the kings of Israel and Judah. The king is to be an equal among the people under the covenant. Deuteronomy is the measure of the success of each of the kings of Israel and Judah.

<span id="page-25-5"></span>The words of Moses are characterized by their warning Israel against conforming to the ways of the Canaanites in worshiping their idols. The kingdoms of Israel and Judah are judged by their obedience to this exhortation of Deuteronomy. Loyalty to the covenant, not political success, determines whether a king is good or bad. Omri is known by the Assyrians as one of the greatest of Israel's kings, but his achievements are assigned a mere six verses in 1 Kings 16:23–28. He was responsible for establishing the capital city of Samaria, but he did what was wrong in the Lord's eyes, as his dynasty was characterized by Phoenician idolatry. His dynasty was a mere forty-five years (885–841 BC), but the account of combating idolatry during this time occupies about one-third of the books of Kings (1 Kings 16:23–2 Kings 10:27), which itself covers four and a half centuries from David to the exile.

<span id="page-25-4"></span>The short period of the Omride dynasty typifies the burden of the narrative of Kings. The books of the Former Prophets in the Hebrew canon (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) are rightly referred to as Deuteronomistic; the scribes of these prophets carry on the language of Deuteronomy as they apply its message through the centuries. Deuteronomy in its canonical form is complemented with information that explains the revelation given to Moses. Features such as historical notes and explanations of people groups in the prologue (Deut. 2:10–12, 20–23; 3:9, 11, 14) were added by scribes in their presentation of the speeches of Moses as a living word for generations of Israel.

#### <span id="page-25-3"></span><span id="page-25-2"></span>*Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-25-1"></span><span id="page-25-0"></span>The superscription of Deuteronomy states clearly the time and occasion of these speeches of Moses (Deut. 1:1–5): in the fields of Moab at the end of the fortieth year from the time they were at Horeb. The chronology is worked out very specifically. The Israelites traveled from Mount Sinai in the second year following the revelation of the covenant (Num. 10:11–12). Then they departed from Kadesh-barnea and crossed the Wadi Zered in the thirty-eighth year after leaving Sinai, after all of the warriors had died from the time of the first making of the covenant. The occasion is the final command of Moses to renew and keep the covenant when the Israelites enter the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua.

#### TIME OF THE EXODUS

Israel is named as a people group in the Egyptian stele of Pharaoh Merneptah (1212–1182 BC), which ends with a poem celebrating his military campaign through the land of Canaan.2 Some scholars deny that this Israel has anything to do with the Israel of the Bible, mainly on grounds that these scholars' conception of biblical Israel could not have existed at this early point in time. However,

<sup>2</sup> The stele is in the Egyptian museum in Cairo. It was discovered in 1896 by Flinders Petrie in western Thebes and contains the earliest inscription that names Israel, described as a regional people in Canaan, as they are in Judges. A translation of the concluding poem on Canaan is provided by James K. Hoffmeier, *COS*, 2.6.

the Israel of this stele is inscriptional evidence that the account of a migration to Canaan as given in the Bible did take place in the Late Bronze Age by the time of the reign of Rameses II (1279–1212 BC). This great pharaoh built the store city known historically as Raamses, which the Bible declares to have been done by the work of Israelite slaves (Ex. 1:11).3 If this is the actual city meant in the biblical reference, the date of the exodus was in the thirteenth century.

<span id="page-26-1"></span><span id="page-26-0"></span>Two reasons lead some to believe that the exodus occurred two hundred years earlier. The first is the date given for the building of the temple: 480 years from the time of the exodus (1 Kings 6:1). Solomon's reign ended in approximately 930 BC, which would place the exodus in the fifteenth century. This dating is correlated with archaeological evidence of the fall of key Canaanite city-states that brought an end to Middle Bronze Age. The inference is that this phase of Canaanite history was the result of the conquest described in the book of Joshua.4 In such an interpretation, the Israelites would have built a city that was a predecessor to Raamses, which is renamed in the exodus account. A possible way to solve the discrepancy between the two dates could come from the schematic periods of forty years in which much of the early chronology in the Bible is given, particularly in the early period of the judges. Forty years refers to the generation of each judge concerned. Since the reference to the building of the temple includes this time period, it is reasonable to interpret the 480 years given in Kings as twelve generations of forty years. In actual chronology, children are born when a woman is in her twenties, so a living generation in chronological years is approximately half the time given in representative terms. The chronological information for this period is both ambiguous and limited. The interpreter of the biblical information must make a choice between two options: either the city of Raamses in Exodus or the number in Kings must be deemed representative, because the total time between Rameses II and Solomon is only about three hundred years.

#### COMPOSITION OF DEUTERONOMY

<span id="page-26-2"></span>In the early nineteenth century the scholar W. M. L. de Wette became highly influential in dating the composition of Deuteronomy to the time of Josiah. He connected the book with the reform described in 2 Kings 22–23, where Josiah makes worship exclusive to a central location in Jerusalem. In the process of restoring the temple a book is found, identified by Huldah the prophetess as a Torah. De Wette concluded that Deuteronomy was composed during the reign of Josiah to serve as a blueprint for his reforms. Critical scholarship after de Wette has continued the theory that

<sup>3</sup> For a discussion of the correlation of Egyptian history with the date of the exodus of Israel cf. W. H. Shea, "Exodus, Date of the," *ISBE* 2:230–38. It is tricky to correlate known Egyptian history with what is stated or implied in Scripture. A defense of a thirteenth-century exodus is provided by Kenneth Kitchen, "Egyptian and Hebrews, from Ra`amses to Jericho," in *The Origin of Early Israel — Current Debate: Biblical, Historical and Archaeological Perspectives*, ed. Shmuel Ahitov and Eliezer D. Oren (Beer-Sheva: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 1998), 65–131; cf. also Kitchen, "The Exodus: Time and Place," *ADB* 2:702–704.

<sup>4</sup> A defense of an early date for the exodus may be found in John J. Bimson, *Redating the Exodus and the Conquest*, JSOTSup 5 (Sheffield, UK: Almond Press, 1981). Bimson's arguments are based on his archaeological interpretation of the Middle Bronze Age and the fall of key cities named in Joshua, such as Jericho, Hazor, Hebron, Arad, and Dan. To make the correlation, Bimson must lower the standard date for the end of the Middle Bronze Age about one hundred years, to about 1450 BC.

<span id="page-27-6"></span>the composition of Deuteronomy is to be associated with the book discovered in the purification of the temple (2 Kings 22:8).5 It can be affirmed that the actions of Josiah were inspired by Deuteronomy, but that does not establish the time of the origin of the book found in the temple. The Chronicler's accounts of Judaean kings from Hezekiah to Josiah report efforts to centralize worship in Jerusalem.

<span id="page-27-7"></span><span id="page-27-1"></span><span id="page-27-0"></span>Contrary to critical scholarship, which asserts that Deuteronomy was written in the time of Josiah, the regulations of Deuteronomy are earlier than the reforms of centralization described in Kings. The book of Deuteronomy without doubt provided authority for Josiah to undertake his reforms, but its specific instructions antedate them. For example, various discrepancies exist between his reforms and Deuteronomy. In Kings, priests coming to Jerusalem cannot serve there (2 Kings 23:9), contrary to Deuteronomy 18:6–8, in which all Levites are equal. Deuteronomy provides for examination of false prophecy (13:2–6) but not for examining idolatry of priests (2 Kings 23:5, 20). The key requirement of centralization had already begun a century earlier than Josiah under Hezekiah, as made clear in Chronicles (2 Chronicles 29–31). Ahaz introduced various forms of idolatry under Assyrian influence that bear no mention in Deuteronomy (2 Kings 23:5–8, 11–13). Thus Deuteronomy is a record of the covenant of Moses, perpetuated by scribes and preached by the prophets, as evidenced in reforms carried out by the kings of Judah following the exile of Israel.

#### <span id="page-27-9"></span><span id="page-27-8"></span>TREATY LANGUAGE OF DEUTERONOMY

Since the middle of the twentieth century it has been observed that Deuteronomy shares many linguistic features with ancient treaties and laws used to regulate interpersonal and international relationships. In 1955 more than 350 fragments of treaties were discovered near a temple of Nabu at Nimrud (ancient Kalhu; biblical Calah). These treaties were made by Esarhaddon, the Assyrian king during the days of Manasseh, with other vassal states, requiring them to swear loyalty to his son and heir, Assurbanipal. These were thought by some to have close affiliation with Deuteronomy, particularly with the curses in Deuteronomy 28:20–57. The more recent discovery of this same treaty in the ancient Syrian territory at Tell Taʻyinat, near the famous city of Alalakh, shows that the kings of Judah would have been subject to this same treaty and would have had a copy of it in the temple.

<span id="page-27-3"></span><span id="page-27-2"></span>However, such literary comparisons are not useful for dating, since scribes made continual use of similar traditions in the making of treaties for millennia. No claim can reasonably be made that the scribes of Deuteronomy were dependent on one known treaty. The curses of Esarhaddon such as drought (28:23), death (v. 26), boils and sores (v. 27), blindness (vv. 28–29), rape (v. 30), loss of property (v. 33), and cannibalism from starvation (vv. 53–57), with their typical descriptions, all have

<span id="page-27-5"></span><span id="page-27-4"></span><sup>5</sup> It should not be assumed there was a consensus about the origin of Deuteronomy. Cf. William Creighton Graham, "The Modern Controversy about Deuteronomy," *JR* 7 (1927): 396–418. Graham discusses the views of G. Hölscher and Adam Welch. The former regarded Deuteronomy as a much later postexilic book, long after the prophets, while the latter associated Deuteronomy with prophetic groups originating with Samuel. The vast differences are an indication of the subjectivity involved in this kind of literary criticism.

roots in ancient treaties going back to the Middle and New Kingdom periods of Egypt, long antedating Moses. Such comparisons are of no value as external evidence in dating Deuteronomy, since such terminology would be familiar to Moses as well as Israelite scribes of any period.

An extensive analysis of treaty, law, and covenant in the ancient Near East by Kitchen and Lawrence brings together a detailed analysis of over a hundred such documents from the third to first millennium BC across the entire Levant.6 The analysis shows that the general form of Deuteronomy corresponds most closely with treaties of the late second millennium, the time of Moses, just before the fall of the Hittite Empire and its many associated Syrian client states. These are distinct from earlier law collections, with the inclusion of stipulations, deposit of the document, reading of the document, and witnesses. The presence of a historical prologue sets apart late second-millennium treaties from all those known before and after that time. It is often denied that this is evidence for the dating of Deuteronomy, since evidence of first-millennium treaties is partial, but it is at least notable that all current information indicates that the form of Deuteronomy is consistent with the time of Moses.

<span id="page-28-1"></span><span id="page-28-0"></span>One notable correlation with Deuteronomy is found only in a Hittite-Egyptian treaty of 1259 BC. Two aspects of the superscription bear resemblance to Deuteronomy. The first is a title to the work: "The Treaty which Rameses II made . . . with Hattusil III," which is like that found in Deuteronomy 1:1 ("the words that Moses spoke"). The second is the description that follows: "Thus (says) Ramesses II . . . [genealogy follows]," which is just like Deuteronomy 1:5 ("Moses undertook to explain this law"). If Moses was brought up in a court at Raamses and served in a foreign office there, he would have participated in drafting this type of treaty and could have used the skills and literary forms learned there in his communicating and writing to the people of Israel. Such correlations should be accounted for. At the least, it is evident that the elements of Deuteronomy have their closest affiliation with documents that come from the time of Moses.

#### HISTORY OF DEUTERONOMY

As with all the books of the Bible, Deuteronomy is a living text, not a buried historical document like the ancient treaties discussed above. It has its original occasion in the final address of Moses to Israel but is preserved as an address to Israel for all the prophets that follow Moses, particularly those who declare God's judgment on Israel in the long and sordid narrative of Joshua through 2 Kings. These scribes and prophets continue to make Deuteronomy a living word through clarifications and explanations for a later time. The language of Deuteronomy has remarkable affiliations with the prophets of these later books. The phrase "to this day" is specifically used of Deuteronomistic interests in the period before the exile: the use of non-Israelite forced labor (1 Kings 9:21), the destruction of altars

<span id="page-28-2"></span><sup>6</sup> The complete text of all known treaties is provided by Kenneth A. Kitchen and Paul J. N. Lawrence, *Treaty, Law and Covenant in the Ancient Near East*, 3 vols. (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2012).

<span id="page-29-8"></span><span id="page-29-7"></span>of false worship (2 Kings 10:27), the ark (1 Kings 8:8), and the rebellion of Edom (2 Kings 8:22; 14:7; 16:6). This phrase is used in Deuteronomy with reference to the preexilic period of the first temple, when the nation underwent revolutionary cultural reforms such as those culminating in the days of Josiah.

Deuteronomy exhibits a focus on one central place of worship in the celebration of its feasts and the purposes they serve. The book never names the central location, but it is quite clear the capital established by David is intended. Deuteronomy does not conceive of more than one location at which God places his name; it is only Jerusalem that qualifies for the place God will choose. Before the conquest of Jerusalem there is no center that serves for all of the tribes. During that period the place chosen by God is limited to an Israelite or Judaean place of worship, wherever it might be. The prohibition is to exclude worship at Canaanite shrines.

The occasion of Deuteronomy, as Israel is about to enter the land, may explain some significant variation in aspects of the legislation of the renewed covenant. In renewing the covenant, Moses envisages a situation of central government in which it will be possible for all of Israel to worship at the location of the temple. These directives are not found in earlier legislative material. Deuteronomy further makes provision for offices of a centralized government, especially that of a king, with appropriate supporting functions of judges and priests. The book evinces notable differences in other regulations as well, such as the release from debt slavery and the protection of the rights of women in relation to property. The law concerning divorce appears only in Deuteronomy, where it is a provision to protect the woman's dowry and other property in the case of marriage breakdown. It is obvious that these modified regulations for Israel as a nation in the land cannot take effect immediately. It will be twelve generations before Solomon dedicates the temple as the one central place of worship for the nation (1 Kings 6:1). Until that time, Israel is a federation of largely independent and often warring tribes, as seen in the narratives of Judges and Samuel. Deuteronomy therefore should be read not as a second law that *replaces* the first at Mount Sinai but as one that *renews* that original covenant. In renewed form, the covenant terms and obligations are suitable to a new situation of living as one nation once the land is fully occupied, including the city of Jerusalem.

At the end of the covenant reaffirmation is the Song of Moses (Deut. 32:1–43), a form of witness to the renewed covenant of Yahweh with Israel. The song ends with a colophon, common in ancient texts, that provides details about the recording of the text (vv. 44–47). The whole narrative concludes with Moses' viewing the land of Canaan (vv. 48–52) and then pronouncing a type of patriarchal final blessing on the people (33:1–29). This is followed by a description of the death and burial of Moses (34:1–8) and his succession by Joshua (v. 9). The book ends with an encomium for Moses (vv. 10–12), making him superior to all the

<span id="page-30-1"></span>other prophets of Israel. The largest portion of the book consists of the covenant form (1:1–32:47), made up of elements similar to those found in other treaties of the ancient Near East.

Roughly one hundred extant laws, treaties, and covenants have been preserved in inscriptions of clay and stone from the world of the ancient Near East. These inscriptions were made at the time the covenant oaths were taken. A comprehensive survey of all such documents from the third millennium into the Persian period across the Levant may be analyzed in terms of fifteen possible components.7 No document contains all these components, and formats vary through the centuries, with various features appearing in specific times and places. The book of Deuteronomy may be analyzed according to the following outline, using the categories of ancient covenants. Several of these elements are interspersed with historical reflections. For the sake of simplicity, the historical reflections are not separated in this outline.8

<span id="page-30-2"></span><span id="page-30-0"></span>The covenant narrative of Deuteronomy is recorded as three sermons of Moses. The whole is introduced with a descriptive title: "These are the words that Moses spoke" (1:1). This type of title is predominant in the first millennium BC but is known as early as the third millennium (at Ebla). This is followed with the verbal variant "thus speaks" format, in which Moses "undertook to explain this law, saying . . ." (v. 5). The phrase "this law [Torah]" is found fifteen times in the book of Deuteronomy, mostly at the beginning and the end of the book. The portion of Deuteronomy referred to as "this law [Torah]" is introduced in 4:44: "This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel." The exposition of this Torah concludes with the curses of 28:15–68. "This law" is referenced repeatedly in the

The exposition of this Torah is the second sermon of Moses, constituting the greatest part of the book of Deuteronomy. The first sermon mainly provides the title and prologue, with several historical reports (2:10–12, 20–23; 3:9, 11, 14). "This law" is introduced in chapter 4 with a lengthy exposition of the significance of Mount Sinai, concluding with the profound "The Lord is God; there is no other" (4:35). The final sermon of Moses following the exposition of this Torah includes the instructions for the deposit and reading of the covenant and the conclusion of the narrative with the death of Moses.

#### *Theology of Deuteronomy*

<span id="page-31-6"></span><span id="page-31-5"></span><span id="page-31-4"></span><span id="page-31-3"></span>The book of Deuteronomy concerns itself with the necessity to love and fear Yahweh. God must be known by his name specifically, the deity revealed at Sinai and in the Torah. There can be no god apart from him if his person and being as a holy God are properly understood (Deut. 4:35, 39). As Moses asks in his prayer for mercy, "What god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?" (3:24). The Holy One is the creator of all things and the source of all life; all that can be known is completely dependent on the God revealed to Israel. Israel has been instructed by his voice; they heard Yahweh from the midst of the blazing fire (4:36). It is only his love for Israel that has made them the object of his revelation and redemption (v. 37). This is not meant to imply that Israel was merely selected from among other nations. Rather, God *created* Israel through his provision to the patriarchs and redeemed their descendants from the land of Egypt. Therefore it is incumbent upon the people of Israel to devote themselves to Yahweh their God in all their thinking, with all their desire, and with all their means (6:5). The Shema (v. 4) is a good summary of Deuteronomy. The confession that Yahweh our God is one is to say that there is none other who may be compared to him. This is not primarily a statement against polytheism, though whatever other gods may be deemed to exist have no significance of any kind for those who know Yahweh. Rather, the Shema primarily declares that Yahweh is unrivaled, a statement made explicit by Isaiah (Isa. 40:18, 25). The creator of space and time cannot be likened to anything or anyone bounded by space and time. Israel therefore can do nothing other than devote its complete allegiance to his love and care.

#### <span id="page-31-12"></span><span id="page-31-8"></span><span id="page-31-7"></span>SOVEREIGNTY OF YAHWEH

<span id="page-31-9"></span><span id="page-31-0"></span>The theology of learning to love and fear God is expressed in the form of a people governed by the treaty of a great suzerain. A suzerain is to be the benefactor of the people he governs, both providing for their well-being and protecting them from danger. Deuteronomy presents a suzerain unlike any other of ancient times, in terms of both his mercy and his sovereignty. God has acted on behalf of Israel simply because he is merciful, as revealed at Sinai (Ex. 33:17–19; 34:5–6). This people has been continuously rebellious. The clear point of Deuteronomy is that these people are not worthy of this gracious divine rule (Deut. 9:4–7). From the beginning this nation has been nothing but recalcitrant against its Lord. But the Lord of mercy is also the God of history; he has created Israel to fulfill his purposes through it. The people come to possess the land and enjoy its blessings because the Lord is loyal to the promises he made to their fathers, beginning with the statement to Abraham that through him all nations might receive a blessing (Gen. 12:3).

<span id="page-32-1"></span><span id="page-32-0"></span>This nation is the result of God's choice to redeem a people for himself. This nation represents God as a kingdom of priests (Ex. 19:5–6), a treasured people among all the peoples of the earth. Through the covenant they represent God to the nations and are the means of accomplishing his destiny for humanity. No other king or nation can stand in the way; it is for this reason alone that they are able to enter a land of kings much mightier than any army they could muster. Their continuance in the covenant is because of his mercy; their status has nothing to do with their righteousness or upright mind. Their Suzerain cannot fail in his rule, and his sovereignty includes the ability to fulfill his purpose. He is the creator of all things, including the nation of Israel, and will fulfill his redemption.

<span id="page-32-3"></span><span id="page-32-2"></span>Love and fear for Yahweh in keeping the covenant are not simply a matter of volition. A covenant is entered by means of decision, but observance of the covenant is something that must be learned. Moses repeatedly exhorts the Israelites toward the necessity of learning to fear the Lord (Deut. 4:10; 14:23; 17:19; 31:12–13). If learning is to take place, teaching must be pursued. Moses is required to teach the Israelites (4:1, 5, 14; 6:1), and the Israelites in turn must teach their children. This instruction is not only of a formal nature in understanding the actual requirements of the covenant and in knowing how to implement those requirements in each situation. This teaching must take place through the activities of daily life as well; it is something to be etched in the mind through observance, repetition, and symbol.

<span id="page-32-6"></span><span id="page-32-5"></span><span id="page-32-4"></span>The immediate sequel to the Shema, the confession of the power and presence of Yahweh that demands devotion of mind, desire, and material goods (6:4–5), is the demand that these words be spoken from the time of rising to that of retiring, whether at home or on the road (vv. 6–9). They are to be bound to the wrist and to the forehead and written on the doorposts of the house. This mandate is repeated in the context of taking the vow once Israel has entered the Promised Land (11:18–20). This is the means of receiving the blessing of the covenant. It is essentially this thought that introduces the psalter in Psalm 1. This psalm describes the person who has received divine approval and therefore enjoys the blessings of life that God provides. This person does not walk in the advice of the ungodly, follow the way of sinners, or join the cynics that cannot find good in anything. Instead such a person delights in the Torah, the source of meditation day and night.

<span id="page-32-7"></span>This is not to suggest that the mind is occupied constantly with the words of the Torah but rather to require that these words have been learned so that they spontaneously govern behavior. They are bound to the hands and the forehead, controlling what a person does and sees and thinks. These are the people with fruitful lives, the ones who enjoy the blessings of the covenant. This is both a collective and an individual matter. Every seven years, this Torah must be read publicly to the <span id="page-33-3"></span><span id="page-33-2"></span><span id="page-33-0"></span>entire nation (Deut. 31:11–13), and the king must take responsibility for knowing it and ruling according to it (17:18–19). The effects of knowing and keeping this Torah are that the wisdom of Israel will be known to the nations (4:6–8). Learning the ways of the Torah becomes a way of life for the whole community so that it elicits exclamations of wonder from the nations around. What nation has a God so near to it as this people's, and what is the source of the regulations that govern it with such wisdom? Learning the life of the covenant is a matter both of intellectual discernment and of the judicial exercise of a way of life.

#### FIDELITY TO THE COVENANT

The Ten Words given by Moses (called the "Ten Commandments") state the covenant commitment in relation to God, the family unit, and the wider community. They are inclusive, dealing with the foundational issues of accountability for loss of life, responsibility to parents, commitment to family, and respect of property. Especially relevant to every individual is their use of words, which so readily misrepresent the truth, whether in legal situations or in everyday life. As such, the values of the Ten Words must always be on the minds of those who have taken the covenant oath. Those under the covenant must not covet, that is, they must not even contemplate doing any of the things that violate interpersonal relationships. Even looking upon a woman with adulterous eyes or conniving of ways to obtain another's property are violations of the relationship with God and with other people.

In addition to these broad and important aspects of the life of the people, Deuteronomy also envisions the practice of the covenant as extending to those activities that are part of the very routines of daily life. The requirement of achieving centralized worship to unite all of Israel has a significant impact on the daily life of the individual. For example, nothing is more basic to human life than food; with centralization, distinctions must be made between sacred food that is sacrificial and food that is common, to be eaten anywhere. Thus Deuteronomy contains the first discussion of slaughter for food that is not sacrificial. There must be a consciousness of food that is sacrificial, dedicated to God, and eaten at the temple. There must also be a consciousness of that food that complies with the classifications of created order and is edible, or which may be suitable for human consumption but is acceptable only for those outside the covenant. Landowners are responsible for producing food that is sacred, and they are a means of providing for the dependent of the community, particularly those without access to property.

<span id="page-33-1"></span>The Sabbath requirements and temple rituals repeatedly emphasize the redemptive aspect of the covenant. Israel must not only be vigilant with tithes and offerings of the firstborn but must also be generous with offerings of thanksgiving (Deut. 15:19–16:17). The people must remember that they were once dependent slaves in Egypt and were redeemed by the mercy of God, apart from any merit of their own. In Deuteronomy all of the temple rituals have the function of providing food for the needy of the community. The festivals are fixed times according to the <span id="page-34-5"></span>phases of the moon and must be calculated and rigidly observed because of those who are dependent on them for their own food supply. Food is the blessing of God, a confession made in every aspect of its production, distribution, and consumption. Individual confession of God's provision for the essentials of life is to be made at the temple with a solemn declaration that nothing has been withheld from the obligations to care for dependents, such as Levites or widows (26:1–15). To love God in every thought is encouraged when much thinking must concentrate on the covenant requirements of daily food. The economy and the activities of daily life revolve around the use of land, the problem of debt, the production of food, and care for the orphan, widow, and Levite. Love and fear of God is expressed in virtually every activity of daily life.

<span id="page-34-7"></span><span id="page-34-2"></span><span id="page-34-1"></span>Other aspects critical to the exclusive bond of the covenant are the possession of the land and the prohibition against compromising with the religions of Canaan. Retaining the gift of the land requires uncompromised loyalty to the covenant relationship. The curses for breaching the covenant conclude with the warning of removal from the land (28:63–65); such warnings are also found in the introductory speech of Moses (4:25–26) and again in the concluding exhortations (30:15–19). One threat to keeping covenant is syncretism with surrounding religions. This danger must be minimized by purging such influences from their midst. The Hebrew word for this is *kherem* ("devoted to destruction"; 2:34; 3:6). This word falls under the semantic domain of being holy, designating that which belongs to God. Vows dedicating things to God, the Hebrew *qadash*, set them apart for sacred use within the common. This could be in support of priest or temple, but it also includes tithes given for the support of the poor (26:13). The devotion of other items, such as the firstborn, constitutes removal from the common (Lev. 27:26–28); these belong to God and have no more ordinary function. As such, living animals will be put to death. This could also include humans, as indicated in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-34-6"></span><span id="page-34-4"></span><span id="page-34-3"></span><span id="page-34-0"></span>In the case of conquest, cities are irrevocably dedicated because God fights the battles and grants the land forever to his people. Divine judgment falls on the inhabitants of Canaan because of their sins. But apostasy could arise within Israel, in which case the same kind of purging will be necessary (Deut. 13:16–17). The same requirement of irrevocable dedication pertains to the peoples of the land (20:16–18). Deuteronomy does not specify just how this is to be carried out in practice, as it clearly assumes that not all Canaan will be put to the sword, but the theological intent is absolute. The practice of idolatry cannot be tolerated not only idolatry by Israelites but also that of the various groups of Canaanites. According to Deuteronomy, a measure of actual physical separation is necessary if the practice of the covenant is to be carried out consistently. Love and fear of God does not exclude judgment—and sometimes requires it.

#### *Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

Deuteronomy came to be one of the books most referenced in the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures. The biblical manuscripts of Qumran provide a guide to the use <span id="page-35-11"></span><span id="page-35-10"></span>of Scripture in the times immediately antecedent to the NT. The three books represented by the most manuscripts are Psalms (39 in total), Deuteronomy (32), and Isaiah (22). This is proportionate to the use of Scripture found in the NT as well.

#### DEUTERONOMY IN THE FORMER PROPHETS

<span id="page-35-12"></span><span id="page-35-9"></span><span id="page-35-2"></span>In Hebrew tradition the prophetic writings are divided into two groups, known as the Former Prophets and the Latter Prophets. The former group consists of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. The latter group consists of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Book of the Twelve. These divisions were substantially followed in the great codices of the earliest Christian Bibles of Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. There the first prophetic history consisted of Joshua, Judges, and 1–4 Kings, with the one variation being that Ruth was inserted after Judges as a story that took place during that time. But both traditions recognize that these books were one great prophetic composition encompassing the story of Israel from the conquest to the exile. They are all anonymous, as is usual for all ancient writings, but they are a continuous narrative that assesses the story of Israel according to their adherence to the Torah as given in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-35-3"></span><span id="page-35-1"></span><span id="page-35-0"></span>Joshua continues the narrative of Deuteronomy in the exhortation to be resolute and courageous, to be careful to observe everything Moses commanded, to be sure the book of "this law [Torah]" (cf. Genre and Literary Features) never leaves the people's speech, and to meditate on it day and night (Josh. 1:6–8). Directly upon the conquest of Jericho and Ai is a report of the Israelites' building an altar at Mount Ebal (Josh. 8:30–35), just as required in Deuteronomy (Deut. 11:29; 27:4–8). There the blessing and curse are read, just as given in the book of the Torah. This event is reported again at the end of Joshua, following the description of the inheritance of all the tribes. Here we find an extensive report describing the gathering of all the tribes at Shechem and a long speech of Joshua, summarizing in Deuteronomistic fashion the challenge to choose life by following the Lord (Josh. 24:1–24). Following the commitment of the people to obey, Joshua makes a covenant written in the words of "the Book of the Law" (Josh. 24:25–26), a stone monument providing continuous testimony to the vows taken there as required in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-35-8"></span><span id="page-35-7"></span><span id="page-35-6"></span><span id="page-35-5"></span><span id="page-35-4"></span>The death of Joshua is reported at the end of Joshua and again at the beginning of Judges to illustrate the conduct of the people in relation to the demands of the book of Deuteronomy. At the end of Joshua, following the making of the covenant, the people are dismissed to their respective inheritances (Josh. 24:28–31). Joshua is buried in his own territory in Ephraim, north of Gaash, while all the generation of Joshua is similarly faithful to the covenant. This passage is verbally repeated in the introduction to the narratives of Judges (Judg. 2:6–10), but the last line of the report is changed to say that the generation following Joshua did not know the Lord. Although the conquest is not complete until long after the death of Joshua, as stated in Joshua 13:1, the presentation is broken down topically into the books of Joshua and Judges. Joshua tells of how the Lord is faithful to the covenant in

keeping his promises to the patriarchs, and Judges tells of how Israel is unfaithful in keeping the instructions Moses gave. Joshua tells of how the land of Canaan comes to be the possession of Israel through the gift of the Lord, and Judges tells of how Israel becomes Canaanite through its association with the people of the land.

<span id="page-36-4"></span><span id="page-36-3"></span>This point is made specifically in Judges 19, in the narrative of a Levite who goes to Bethlehem in Judah to bring his concubine back to Ephraim. On his return with his concubine, the day becomes late while they are near the city of Jebus (later called Jerusalem). They need to find lodging, but they deliberately avoid pagan Canaanite cities and go on to Gibeah of Benjamin to find a place for the night (Judg. 19:11–26). They find no hospitality, a fundamental failure in ancient society. Finally an old man, not an Israelite, coming home from his work in the field, invites them into his house. The men of that city demand sexual relations with the guests. Being denied their primary desire, they abuse the concubine of the Levite until she dies. The narrative intentionally mirrors that of Lot in Sodom in Genesis 19:4–10 (cf. Judg. 19:22–25); only the names and the places are changed. Sodom epitomizes the sins of Canaan, and it is that kind of conduct that now characterizes Israel.

#### <span id="page-36-0"></span>A DEUTERONOMISTIC HISTORY

<span id="page-36-5"></span><span id="page-36-2"></span><span id="page-36-1"></span>The narrative of the Former Prophets has frequent allusions to the language of Deuteronomy and its warnings. Under the oppression of the Midianites, the Israelites cry out to God (Judg. 6:7–10). An unnamed prophet arises to rebuke their failure with words reminiscent of the warnings of Deuteronomy. When the people desire a king like the other nations, Samuel the prophet warns them with a description of taxation and servitude typical of ancient kings (1 Sam. 8:10–18). This is the converse of a king who keeps a copy of the Torah to live by because he is under the covenant alongside his brother Israelites (Deut. 17:18–20). When Israel goes into exile under the Assyrian king Shalmaneser, the book of Kings provides a long sermon in the terminology of Deuteronomy (2 Kings 17:7–18), cataloging the ways Israel has failed to heed the words of Moses. Specific mention is made of the building of high places and the worship of idols, the failure to hear the warnings of the many prophets who have testified against them, and their stubbornness in being stiff-necked.

<span id="page-36-6"></span>The influence of Deuteronomy in the Former Prophets is so significant that it led to a paradigm shift in critical studies of the Pentateuch. Martin Noth recognized that this prophetic history was the work of an author who brought together varied traditions according to a carefully conceived plan.9 Noth made a case for a form of Deuteronomy serving as an introduction to the four books now known as the Former Prophets. He described the whole as a composition by a scribal editor or author carrying out this work in the middle of the seventh century after the release of Jehoiachin from prison (2 Kings 25:27–30). He believed that this author

<span id="page-36-7"></span><sup>9</sup> Martin Noth's study was published in English as *The Deuteronomistic History*, trans. by Jane Doull et al., JSOTSup 15 (Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1981).

composed a chronological framework for the whole period and created a comprehensive historical work of Israel. These traditional materials were independently arranged and ordered into a sequence created by summaries that anticipate and recapitulate. These passages have the monotonous repetition of the same simple expressions and continual reference to the divine law, the necessity of obedience, and the disastrous consequences of disobedience. The Former Prophets have subsequently come to be termed the Deuteronomistic History.

But Deuteronomy is not an introduction to the Former Prophets, as Noth proposed. It is the last words of Moses, which form an appropriate conclusion to his life and teaching.10 The work of Noth is, however, instructive for understanding better the influence of Deuteronomy in the exhortations, warnings, and promises of the Former Prophets. Since Noth, the theories of early histories of Israel, labeled J, E, D, and P, which were assumed to include much of the material found in Joshua–2 Kings, have been gradually abandoned. Deuteronomy is a unified work that stands alone, and the prophetic work that follows is a continuation of the life of Israel composed from a great variety of records of Israel brought together to form a complete work with a unified message. Deuteronomy provides the literary and historical context for this great work. This was not the work of one person in the exile, as Noth opined.

<span id="page-37-3"></span><span id="page-37-2"></span><span id="page-37-1"></span>There is a consensus that some form of this prophetic work existed in the time of Josiah, when there was great hope for the establishment of a centralized worship and the rule of a Davidic king in Jerusalem.11 Josiah followed the Torah precisely as prescribed by Deuteronomy (2 Kings 23:25), but his reign ended tragically with his death at the hands of Pharaoh Neco at Megiddo (2 Kings 23:29). From then on Jerusalem was under the control of Egypt and then Babylon until the exile. Second Kings blames Manasseh for the doom of the exile that could not be reversed even by a king so worthy as Josiah (2 Kings 23:26–27; 24:3–4), an assessment that may have been part of the completion of Kings after Judah went into exile. But Kings covers a period of more than four hundred years, one that stretches from David to the exile and involves numerous prophets. Isaiah is a prominent example of a prophet involved in royal affairs, as shown in the account used in 2 Kings 18–21. Earlier versions of Kings can be detected in the distinct formula used for the books' sources.12 Some form of the prophetic history of Israel was already in existence by the time of Hezekiah.

<span id="page-37-0"></span>The process of dividing this long prophetic history into books as we have them is no longer known, but they are a continuous narrative telling the story of Israel according to Israel's faithfulness to the covenant as expressed in Deuteronomy.

<sup>10</sup> An instructive study on the origin and function of Deuteronomy may be found in Daniel I. Block, "Recovering the Voice of Moses: The Genesis of Deuteronomy," *JETS* 44/3 (2001): 385–408. It is evident that Moses did not write everything in Deuteronomy, which is updated for later generations, but Moses was responsible for a Torah that Israel brought with them from Egypt.

<sup>11</sup> Hope expressed in Kings is developed by Frank M. Cross, "The Themes of the Book of Kings and the Structure of the Deuteronomistic History," in *Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973), 274–289.

<sup>12</sup> Evidence for earlier versions is provided by August H. Konkel, "Hezekiah in Biblical Traditions," (PhD diss., Westminster Theological Seminary, 1987), 124–126.

<span id="page-38-7"></span>Israel as a political entity would come to an end, but that would not be the end of the covenant. The Former Prophets include the confirmation of a divine kingdom through the ordination of a king celebrated in Psalm 2, and they anticipate a realization of the kind of kingdom taught by Moses in Deuteronomy.

#### DEUTERONOMY IN THE LATTER PROPHETS

<span id="page-38-12"></span><span id="page-38-11"></span><span id="page-38-10"></span><span id="page-38-9"></span><span id="page-38-5"></span>The book of Deuteronomy was apparently very influential in the reforms of Josiah in centralizing all worship to the temple in Jerusalem. The requirement of reading the Torah would likely have been followed during his reign (Deut. 31:10–11). The prophecy of Jeremiah begins around the time of Josiah's reformation in 622 BC and continues until after the exile in 586. The language and influence of Deuteronomy might be expected to be prominent in Jeremiah, as seems to be the case in many of its prose sermons, such as Jeremiah 19:1–20:6, which is also reminiscent of his temple sermon in chapter 7. Jeremiah uses the object lesson of a shattered flask to depict the fall of the people of Jerusalem (Jer. 19:1–2, 10). Notable in this chapter is the Deuteronomic language in the warning of Jeremiah 19:3–9. Here Jeremiah addresses the kings of Judah, warning them against the shedding of innocent blood and the idolatry of the high places. Onlookers will whistle at the destroyed city reduced to cannibalism. Although these verses are well integrated in the passage, particularly with a play on the word for flask (Hb. *baqbuk*) and the shattering of the plans of Jerusalem (*baqqoti* ), they distinguish themselves as language of the covenant applied to the rebellious city. As the prophet of the exile who applies the curses of Deuteronomy against those who break the covenant, Jeremiah frequently exhibits the influence this book of the Torah has in his preaching.

<span id="page-38-15"></span><span id="page-38-14"></span><span id="page-38-13"></span><span id="page-38-3"></span><span id="page-38-1"></span>The language and themes of Deuteronomy are also found in other prophetic literature. The themes of Deuteronomy include the struggle against idolatry, the centralization of the cult, the exodus, the covenant, the election of Israel, the observance of the law, and the inheritance of the land.13 Like Deuteronomy, Hosea engages in polemics against idolatry, arguing that idols are the handiwork of a craftsman (Hos. 8:6; 13:2). He speaks of "transgressing the covenant" (Hb. *ʻaberu berit*; Hos. 6:7; 8:1;), words characteristic of Deuteronomy (e.g., Deut. 17:2). The breaking of the covenant is the equivalent of forgetting God (Hos. 13:6; Deut. 8:11–14). The book of Isaiah begins with God's condemnation of Israel because of her disobedience to the covenant in language prominent in Deuteronomy. Isaiah opens with God's calling for the testimony of witnesses against the disobedience of Israel. Witnesses to the ancient covenant and the conduct of Israel are the heavens and the earth (Isa. 1:2), an appeal found repeatedly in Deuteronomy (Deut. 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1). Isaiah speaks of God's bringing up sons, which is one of the metaphors of the relationship of God and Israel used in Deuteronomy (14:1; 32:6, 18). Isaiah 1 opens with a condemnation of Israel and an appeal to learn to do

<span id="page-38-8"></span><span id="page-38-6"></span><span id="page-38-4"></span><span id="page-38-2"></span><span id="page-38-0"></span><sup>13</sup> Cf. Moshe Weinfeld, *Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic School* (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), 320–365. Weinfeld has proposed that a scribal circle began its work in the time of Josiah and continued into the exile, prominently influencing the Former Prophets and the book of Jeremiah. He has produced an inventory of Deuteronomistic phrases around the themes of Deuteronomy in a lengthy appendix to his book.

<span id="page-39-5"></span>good and seek justice, as Moses exhorted (Isa. 1:2–20). Jerusalem and its leaders particularly come under denunciation, as they have utterly failed to care for the orphan and widow, as demanded by Deuteronomy.

#### DEUTERONOMY IN THE NT

<span id="page-39-7"></span><span id="page-39-6"></span>Deuteronomy is also prominent in the life of Jesus. One of the most critical points in the life of Jesus is when he is tested by the Devil (Matt. 4:1–11). This event follows immediately upon the baptism of Jesus, by which he voluntarily identifies with those acknowledging their need of forgiveness by making a public confession of repentance in submission to baptism. After this identification with those pursuing righteousness (cf. Isa. 51:1), Jesus is led by the Spirit to face the testing of the Devil. This is a crucial part of his preparation in submitting to the will of the Father in his glorification through the cross. The circumstance of Jesus in the wilderness has its parallel with that of Israel in its journeys. The forty days of Jesus' fasting are a complete period, much as the measure of a generation was forty years in the wilderness. In this circumstance, Jesus is completely dependent upon God as his body has reached the extremity of its endurance. In the same way, the entirety of Israel in the wilderness was utterly dependent on God for its provision.

<span id="page-39-3"></span>But Israel failed the test of trusting in God; in Deuteronomy, Moses exhorts them to learn the lessons of the wilderness and the necessity of trusting in God. They will now come to a land of abundance, but this will not change their need. They are still dependent on God for their existence in the same way. The manna provided by God is a lesson that mortals do not live by bread alone (Deut. 8:3). Humans cannot prevent death; therefore, human well-being is dependent on more than the ability to produce bread, a temporary provision of life. When the Devil tempts Jesus to turn stones into bread (Matt. 4:3), Jesus appropriately responds with the word of Moses to Israel. Our dependence on God is for more than bread; bread alone cannot produce life.

<span id="page-39-8"></span><span id="page-39-4"></span><span id="page-39-2"></span>The Devil's second temptation is for Jesus to jump off a tower of the temple, arguing that God protects the life of his own and citing Psalm 91:12 as a prooftext. The deception in this test is that leaping from the temple shows a lack of trust rather than proof of it. When Israel comes to the land and the people have houses full of good things, they must not test the Lord as they did at Massah (Deut. 6:16), forgetting the God that brought them out of Egypt (v. 12). Their very life is proof of the divine presence. Jesus answers the Devil with the exhortation of Moses (Matt. 4:7), arguing that God is to be trusted, not tested to demand proof of his presence as Israel had done in their complaining.

<span id="page-39-10"></span><span id="page-39-9"></span><span id="page-39-1"></span><span id="page-39-0"></span>The final test of the Devil is one of simple idolatry; he promises to give Jesus the kingdoms of the world in return for allegiance (Matt. 4:8–9). This is the fundamental warning of Moses when the Israelites receive God's abundance: they must guard themselves and be sure they serve the Lord alone, taking the vow of allegiance without taking his name in vain (Deut. 6:13). After this clear and decisive

<span id="page-40-2"></span>word from the exhortation of Moses, the Devil leaves Jesus (Matt. 4:10–11). God in turn sends his provision to Jesus through the service of angels.

<span id="page-40-5"></span><span id="page-40-4"></span><span id="page-40-3"></span>Among the apostle Paul's letters, the theology of Deuteronomy is exemplified in his defense of the restoration of Israel in Romans 9–11. Paul first establishes that the promises of God have not failed, since God has always worked through the elect (Rom. 9:6–29). Paul then addresses the current situation of Israel (Rom. 9:30–10:21). In the third section Paul addresses the question of whether God could have rejected his people Israel (Rom. 11:1–36). Paul addresses the current situation of Israel through his interpretation of the message of Moses in Deuteronomy. The answer comes in two parts. The first concerns the nature of the gospel (Rom. 9:32– 10:13) and the second God's relation to Israel through the gospel (Rom. 10:14–21).

<span id="page-40-11"></span><span id="page-40-10"></span><span id="page-40-8"></span><span id="page-40-7"></span><span id="page-40-6"></span><span id="page-40-0"></span>Israel has stumbled in not realizing that Christ is the goal of the Torah (Rom. 10:4), the fulfillment of its teaching. The righteousness of God expounded in the Torah is to be found in Christ. Israel has not understood that God is impartial in his righteousness and that it is God's gift to all those who have faith in Christ. Paul presents his argument for covenant renewal in Romans 10:6–11. He explains this renewal in terms of what is happening through the preaching of the gospel. The exile of Israel, anticipated in Deuteronomy 29:21–28, continued until the coming of Christ. That time of exile was brought to an end with his coming. Jesus has instituted the new covenant and brought about covenant renewal as anticipated in chapter 30. The sign of membership in this renewed covenant is faith that confesses Jesus Christ as Lord. The nearness of the word promised by Moses in 30:11–14 is now heard in the preaching of the gospel. This is the word of faith preached in Paul's gospel (Rom. 10:8–9). Paul applies what is said about the word of the Torah to the Messiah as its fulfillment; he is not far away, for he has come down from heaven. As such, when the word of his preaching is in the mind, it is a sign that the work of the new covenant has taken place through faith.

<span id="page-40-9"></span><span id="page-40-1"></span>Paul views the latter chapters of Deuteronomy as a prophetic description of the story of the covenant from Moses to his own day and beyond. This same expectation of the fulfillment of the covenant of Deuteronomy is expressed by the teacher of righteousness in the Qumran community in the concluding exhortation of a reconstructed document known as 4QMMT. The teacher at Qumran also believed that at long last his community was experiencing the renewal promised by Moses. The stumbling of Israel at this covenant fulfillment does not put them outside the reach of God's grace (Rom. 10:14–21). God continues to extend his grace to a disobedient and rebellious people. He will provoke them to recognize this grace through the Gentiles, those who had not understood the Torah.

This sampling of the influence of Deuteronomy throughout the Scriptures illustrates the profound influence this sermon of Moses has had throughout the story of redemption—from its inception, when God established the covenant at Sinai, until the fulfillment of the new covenant in Christ and the ultimate redemption of Israel. Allusions to Deuteronomy or direct reference to it can be found in virtually all the writings of Scripture.

#### *Preaching from Deuteronomy*

<span id="page-41-7"></span><span id="page-41-6"></span><span id="page-41-4"></span>In his last exhortation to Israel, Moses lays out clearly the demands of faith that are fundamental for all time. The first demand of faith is a trust in God that Deuteronomy describes as learning to fear God and to love him (Deut. 6:1–2; 11:1–2). These words are defined in Deuteronomy according to the requirement to keep the commandments. This requirement is not to be taken in a legalistic sense; the commandments do not lend themselves to legalistic interpretation. When Jesus is asked about the greatest commandment, his response is that of 6:4–5: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength" (Mark 12:30). The commandment to love cannot be observed by supplementing it with a list of rules, as was Pharisaic practice. Thus Jesus has no patience with the Pharisaic method of interpretation. For all of its good intentions, its zeal, and its pride, it was a complete misunderstanding of the divine demand in Deuteronomy. Love and fear are internal motives of trust and surrender. Love is a commitment made in the confidence that care and support will be found; submission is the response of fearing the consequences of disobedience.

<span id="page-41-11"></span><span id="page-41-9"></span><span id="page-41-2"></span>Confessions of love for God are found in the first four of the Ten Words in Deuteronomy 5:6–15. These include exclusive trust in God (words one and two), an oath commitment regarding the name of God (word three), and the observance of the Sabbath to confess the reality of being a redeemed people entering God's rest (word four). These words are at the heart of preaching Deuteronomy and must be articulated in Christian terms. The oath of allegiance to the new covenant is expressed in commitment to the Lord Jesus (Rom. 10:6–10); confession of this commitment is made in baptism. The Sabbath observance is a way of declaring divine redemption, entering the rest that began with the exodus, as taught in Hebrews, especially 3:1–4:11. The Christian remembrance of redemption, the Israelites' Passover meal, is communion, as Jesus teaches his disciples at his last Passover meal. The resurrection is the new covenant fulfillment of that redemption, and it is why Christians already in NT times began to set apart the first day of the week as their confession of redemptive rest.

#### <span id="page-41-12"></span>LIVING IN FAITHFULNESS TO GOD

<span id="page-41-10"></span><span id="page-41-8"></span><span id="page-41-5"></span><span id="page-41-0"></span>When Jesus is in Jerusalem, one of the scholars of the law comes to him with a test question about the greatest commandment (Mark 12:28–34). Jesus responds with the Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4 and adds a corollary: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31). The very words demanding love of a neighbor are found in Leviticus 19:18, but the requirement to love one's neighbor is explained in Deuteronomy. Words one through four in Deuteronomy 5:6–14 demand an uncompromising commitment to God, who alone is holy. God is the source of life and all material well-being; everything belongs to him. This demands the total devotion of our lives to him and the requirement to love others.

<span id="page-41-3"></span><span id="page-41-1"></span>Words five through nine in Deuteronomy 5:15–19 are the means of loving one's neighbor and include protection of life, family, property, and truth. If all of these <span id="page-42-7"></span>words are observed in relation to other people, then one loves a neighbor as oneself. The learned man asking Jesus the question about the greatest commandment recognizes this fully in his response: all of the rituals of sacrifice carry no worth apart from these observances (Mark 12:32–33). Jesus acknowledges the rational response of the erudite man; this man understands what God is looking for in a citizen of his kingdom. In Deuteronomy sacrifice is limited to the great gatherings of harvest that are the occasions of making provision for the poor. The words of Jesus are an exposition of Deuteronomy in his context. In the same way, these words of Deuteronomy must be contextualized in our preaching. This is the gospel of the kingdom.

<span id="page-42-6"></span><span id="page-42-5"></span><span id="page-42-4"></span><span id="page-42-0"></span>On another occasion a rich ruler asks Jesus about how he might inherit eternal life (Mark 10:17). Jesus answers with reference to the words found in Deuteronomy 5:16–20, the six words (commandments) of instruction for human relations (Mark 10:19). The ruler replies that he has kept these stipulations from the time he was young. Jesus responds with a short lesson from Deuteronomy: sell everything you have and give it to the poor (Mark 10:21). The ruler must understand what it means to love God with his mind, his desire, and his wealth. It means that possessions belong to God. If this ruler is to love God as demanded in Deuteronomy, he must know that his great wealth is not his own to use for himself. Good preaching explains how our lives and possessions are shared with others because they belong to God. It is the demand of love for the Creator and Redeemer.

#### LIVING IN FAITHFULNESS TO OTHERS

Human life functions in family units. The essence of the fifth word, which requires people of the covenant to honor father and mother, is that human life depends on family. This is another of the laws of Deuteronomy that cannot be reduced to rules. This did not prevent interpreters of Deuteronomy in the time of Jesus from creating rules around it, though they were hardly the kind that showed love for God. The Pharisees were scrupulous about cleanliness, but when it came to honoring their parents, their rule was that they could make a gift of their property in lieu of care for their parents (Matt. 15:2–8). This annulled the word of God in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-42-3"></span><span id="page-42-2"></span>The tenth word in Deuteronomy expresses clearly the demand of love. It begins in the mind, in how a person thinks. One must not desire the wife of his neighbor (Deut. 5:21). Not only is committing adultery forbidden, but lusting after the wife of another is already to commit adultery and is a violation of love for God and neighbor. Honor of parents, faithfulness in marriage, and control of sexual desires are essential to family. This is the preaching Deuteronomy demands. It provides many examples that state the required response that will implement these commands.

<span id="page-42-1"></span>Family requires the support of community, which means that individuals must not desire any of the property of their neighbors (5:19). Theft begins not with the act of appropriation but with the desire to have the property of another. Similarly, controlling wrong desires is the frame of thinking that lends to telling the truth, not using deceptive words to elude the truth in self-interest. These are fundamental to neighborliness and should be among the pillars that support good preaching.

Life, family, and property are the three basic values that provide stability in every society, and these three values permeate the whole book of Deuteronomy. God has granted Israel life and is leading them to his chosen place of rest. There they must protect their families, value their property, guard the integrity of the community, and care for the poor. The detailed instructions of this Torah give many examples from daily life as to how this must be done. This is the teaching that is the basis of discipleship for the follower of Jesus. These fundamental truths are developed throughout the book of Deuteronomy as Moses prepares the people for life in the Promised Land. This gospel of Moses is brought to its goal in the work of Jesus Christ, who is leading us to the place of rest, our final redemption (Heb. 4:1–10). The exhortation of Deuteronomy is repeated in Hebrews: "While the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it" (Heb. 4:1). This is the fear of true faith. Love of God is to live according to the teaching of Deuteronomy. Faith is the fear of falling short in completing the instructions that Moses exhorts Israel to keep. This book is the most comprehensive for preaching Christian discipleship.

#### <span id="page-43-4"></span><span id="page-43-3"></span>*Interpretive Challenges*

Deuteronomy is largely straightforward prose that is not difficult to exegete. The text is among the best preserved in the Hebrew Bible. There is rarely a case at which a textual difference known from the Greek translation makes a substantial difference to the interpretation of a passage or has any influence on the message of the book. The main challenges in Deuteronomy come from differences with parallel texts, sometimes within Deuteronomy but at other times in comparison with other passages from the Pentateuch. Three important problems concern the appointment of the judicial system, the route of the exodus, and the function of the priesthood.

<span id="page-43-0"></span>Three accounts of judicial organization must be related to each other. The first is that of Moses' establishing a system of military order on the directive of his father-in-law, Jethro (Ex. 18:13–27). The second is in Numbers 11, which recounts the choosing of seventy elders as directed by God in connection with the Israelites' murmuring about manna. The third is in Deuteronomy, as the initiative to appoint judges is taken by the people and carried out under the direction of Moses. These do not seem to be variants of one single event, but they do all describe one system of leadership in the wilderness.

<span id="page-43-2"></span><span id="page-43-1"></span>The exodus route is described in Numbers and Deuteronomy, but with differences between the two accounts. According to Deuteronomy the Israelites leave Kadesh in the second year after the exodus and travel southeast toward the Gulf of Elath, where they spend thirty-eight years on the borders of Seir and Edom (Deut. 1:46–2:3, 14). They cross the gorge of the Arabah at its southern end near Elath and travel north toward Wadi Zered, where they enter Moab. According to the itinerary of Numbers 33 the Israelites camp at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Elath before journeying to Kadesh-barnea. They leave Kadesh in the thirty-eighth year from the <span id="page-44-7"></span><span id="page-44-6"></span><span id="page-44-5"></span><span id="page-44-4"></span><span id="page-44-0"></span>exodus, the time when Aaron dies on Mount Hor (Num. 33:37–39). From there they journey along a northern route toward the border of Moab (Num. 33:41–44). According to Numbers 20:1 the visit to Kadesh is in the fortieth year. The narrative in Numbers requires two visits to Kadesh, one at the time of the spies (Num. 13:26) and another during the journey to Moab (Num. 33:36–37). The itinerary in Numbers 33 does not describe travel south to the Gulf of Elath in the journey to Moab. All of the locations are on a northern route around the south side of the Dead Sea. The two descriptions of entering Moab suggests to some that there is more than one migration, on different routes.14 The narratives of Numbers and Deuteronomy present Moses as the leader of a single exodus to Kadesh-barnea, where rebellion results in forty years of wilderness wandering before entering the Promised Land through Moab. Whatever the differences in the journey, the accounts are united in portraying a united exodus.

<span id="page-44-2"></span><span id="page-44-1"></span>When it comes to the function of the priesthood, Deuteronomy makes no distinction between Levites and the more limited group of Aaron's descendants serving as priests. Levites are given tasks and remuneration otherwise limited to the sons of Aaron (Deut. 18:1–8). In the census summary of Numbers 4:47, however, the work of the Levites is limited to the duties of service and porterage of the tent of meeting. In Numbers the Hebrew term *ʻabodah* ("service"; e.g., Num 3:26) is used exclusively for the work of the Levites in providing for the physical structure of the tabernacle; it is never used for the work of the priests. Elsewhere, though, the word refers to any activities dealing with the ritual function of the temple. Deuteronomy specifies that the priests, the sons of Levi, are the custodians of the ark that contains the writing of the Torah (Deut. 31:9), but this is a marked contrast with the description of the work of priests given in Numbers.

<span id="page-44-8"></span><span id="page-44-3"></span>The oldest means of dealing with these differences is to find ways to harmonize them. This method goes back to the Pentateuch texts themselves, which sometimes insert a portion from another book to harmonize accounts. The commentary will point out an example of this in the matter of sending the spies, as the Samaritan Pentateuch inserts Deuteronomy 1:22–23 at the beginning of Numbers 13 to harmonize the two books. All of the accounts are partial and structured in a somewhat topical fashion, so it may be assumed that they describe different aspects of the same event. Harmonization was especially adopted in seeking to bring various locations and descriptions of the exodus into a complementary relationship.

There is much to be said for this kind of interpretation, but the influence of the passage of time must also be taken into account. Scribes inherited traditions, which they made relevant for their audience. Deuteronomy anticipates an entirely new situation for the people of the covenant in the Promised Land. The role of Levites would necessarily change when the porterage of the tabernacle ceased.

<sup>14</sup> Cf. Yohanan Aharoni, *The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography*, rev. ed., trans. and ed. A. F. Rainey (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1979), 200–206. Aharoni explains this historically as territorial change over time. In his book's historical geography, he explains that Midian was a sophisticated civilization before the arrival of Edom and had good relations with Egypt. At that time there was no resistance to a direct journey to Heshbon, the kingdom of Sihon. Subsequently settlements developed in Edom and Moab that forced Israel to take a longer route from the south.

Deuteronomy looks forward to a time of one temple and a single place of worship. This would be centuries after Moses, but scribes writing after Moses would have been living at a time when some of these changes were beginning to be realized. By the time the Torah was discovered in the temple in the days of Josiah, the relevance of its message for one place of worship would be immediate, along with the role of Levites in carrying out that function.

A further method of the scribes was to structure material in order to present certain topics in a certain way. Numbers deals with the exodus as a transition toward the Promised Land. Deuteronomy looks back on the exodus events as an exhortation to avoid the failure of faith that had brought them to the plains of Moab a generation later. The locations of the wanderings and the significance of the names may already have become generalized by the time the scribes inscribed the messages Moses left the people. The contours of the events were well known and articulated for the hortatory lessons. The information of the wilderness traditions is insufficient to establish a chronology of events synchronous with the locations to which God guided his people. Differences in Deuteronomy must be interpreted within the limits of the purpose of the book, as there is insufficient information for developing a more precise portrait of the whole. This does not compromise the significance of the events; enough is known to serve the purposes of each composition.

### <span id="page-49-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 1:1–18

1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. **<sup>2</sup>** It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. **<sup>3</sup>** In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment to them, **<sup>4</sup>** after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. **<sup>5</sup>**Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying, **<sup>6</sup>** "The Lord our God said to us in Horeb, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain. **7**Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. **<sup>8</sup>** See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.'

**<sup>9</sup>** "At that time I said to you, 'I am not able to bear you by myself. **10**The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven. **11**May the Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you! **12**How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife? **13**Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.' **14**And you answered me, 'The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.' **<sup>15</sup>** So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes. **16**And I charged your judges at that time, 'Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him. **17**You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.' **18**And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do."

#### *Section Overview: Superscription; Territory of the Land of Promise; Appointment of Chiefs*

The circumstances of the instruction of Moses is laid out in a full description of place and time. Although the information of this complex superscription to the sermons of Moses appears to be a fragmentary association of times and places, it has a sensibly ordered symmetry. The description of this setting must be understood according to the way in which it is ordered:

- <span id="page-50-5"></span><span id="page-50-4"></span><span id="page-50-0"></span>(A) Site in the wilderness before the journey through Moab (v. 1)
	- (B) Time addressed in the first sermon of Moses (v. 2)
		- (C) Date at which the instruction of Moses began (v. 3)
	- (B') Time addressed in the second sermon of Moses (v. 4)
- <span id="page-50-7"></span><span id="page-50-6"></span>(A') Site in Moab after the conquest of Transjordan (v. 5)

The first two lines of the chiasm identify the beginning of the wilderness journey; the last two identify its termination in the plains of Moab. This comprehensive inclusio explains the fortieth year of these sermons.

<span id="page-50-9"></span><span id="page-50-8"></span><span id="page-50-3"></span><span id="page-50-2"></span>The Hebrew text indicates a break after Deuteronomy 2:1, dividing the introductory narrative into two units: 1:1–2:1 and 2:2–29. Following the heading in 1:1–5, the first part of the narrative includes events in the year following the exodus, beginning with the command to leave Horeb (v. 6). The second part begins at the end of the forty-year sojourn, when God said they had traveled the hill country of Kadesh-barnea long enough (2:3). Deuteronomy 1:6 and 2:3 have a certain rhyme: *shevet bahar* ("you have stayed about this mountain," AT; 1:6) and *sob 'et har* ("you have been travelling about these hills," AT; 2:3). The superscription introduces each of these two sections: the first when they left Horeb and the second when they arrived in Moab.

<span id="page-50-11"></span><span id="page-50-10"></span>This complex heading sets out the background for the exposition of "this law" expounded by Moses (1:5). "This law" is the heart of Deuteronomy, its teaching being foundational to the life of the people. The first address of Moses begins with the journey from Mount Sinai in 1:6. The second sermon introduces "this . . . law" in 4:44, when Moses explains it to Israel. "This law" refers to the exhortations of chapters 5–11 and the regulations of 12–28. These instructions and responsibilities of the covenant are concluded with the exhortation of the third sermon in chapters 29–30. The exposition of this Torah is given after the defeat of Sihon and Og (1:4), when the forty years of wilderness wandering are complete (v. 3). The superscription introduces the times and places covered in the three sermons of Moses.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-50-1"></span>1:1–2 The locations named in the first verse are found in the wilderness of the Sinai Peninsula. The years of wilderness wandering were spent almost entirely in <span id="page-51-8"></span><span id="page-51-0"></span>this wilderness. The wilderness named "Arabah" is a deep rift that extends a valley south of the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba (see 1:7; 2:8). The term also commonly includes the Jordan Valley from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. The name "Suph" (= "reeds") was a designation of the Red Sea in ancient times. When Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, the people went through the *Yam Suf* (Ex. 15:4). That location is not known, but it cannot be the one here in Deuteronomy. Ancient writers also referred to the port of Elath (Gulf of Aqaba) on the Red Sea as *Yam Suf* (Deut. 1:40; 2:1), which is the context of the places mentioned in this verse; the Israelites were in this area at a time in which Moses could have delivered his exhortation.

<span id="page-51-9"></span><span id="page-51-6"></span>In verse 1, Suph appears to be a further definition of Arabah. "Opposite Suph" is a natural translation of the Hebrew *mol suf*, referring to the location at which the Israelites began their march in the Arabah from Seir toward Moab. The other five locations define a region in the southern Sinai Peninsula. The Desert of Paran refers to the Sinai Peninsula; the name Paran in this verse may designate the largest oasis in southeast Sinai (Feiran), near traditional Mount Sinai. Tophel is known only in this reference as a place near Paran.15 Hazeroth was the site of the second encampment after Sinai (Num. 11:35; 33:17). Laban may be the same as Libnah in the Sinai (Num. 33:17–21). Dizahab is located on the Gulf of Aqaba.

<span id="page-51-5"></span><span id="page-51-3"></span><span id="page-51-2"></span>Kadesh-barnea is the largest oasis in the Sinai Peninsula, just west of the modern Egypt-Israel border. It is a site of fertile fields and several springs, situated near the junction of the "Way to Shur" leading to Egypt and the road linking Raphia to Elath on the Gulf of Aqaba.16 The Mount Seir route ended in Edom, the area south of the Dead Sea. Israel later requested permission to travel this route from Kadeshbarnea to Edom (Num. 20:16). The journey from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-barnea on this route was only eleven days.17 This was all the time Israel needed to arrive at the entrance to the Promised Land. The events at Kadesh-barnea, however, resulted in Israel's wandering this wilderness for thirty-eight years. The consequences of not trusting in God are one of the themes of the first address of Moses.

<span id="page-51-7"></span><span id="page-51-1"></span>1:3–5 The three sermons of Deuteronomy given at the command of Yahweh are dated precisely to the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year in order to integrate them into the previous chronology of the books of the Torah (cf. Num. 10:11; Deut. 2:14). The time of the rebellious generation is now over. The sermons preached earlier in Sinai, described in the opening verse, must be repeated to another generation. The time is described in relation to the critical military conquests that enabled Israel to camp in the Transjordan (Num. 21:21–22:1), which are

<span id="page-51-4"></span><sup>15</sup> The customary location on maps is on the King's Highway between Punon (a copper mine) and Wadi Zered. This is based on the journey to Moab but cannot be the reference of this verse.

<sup>16</sup> The name Raphia does not occur in the Bible but is found in both Mesopotamian and Egyptian writings in early biblical times. Throughout antiquity it was an important boundary between Canaan and Egypt. It is about 30 miles (48 km) north of Wadi el-Arish. ͑

<sup>17</sup> The actual location of Mount Sinai will remain a mystery, and the traditional location (Jebel Musa) will not change. For discussion cf. Hershel Shanks, "Where is Mount Sinai? The Case for Har Karkom and the Case for Saudi Arabia," *BAR* 40/2 (March–April 2014): 30–41, 66–67. Shanks reports on a colloquium held in Israel defending Har Karkom as the location. He discusses the traditional location and the establishment of a church around a plant identified as the burning bush, today the location of St. Catherine's Monastery.

the second key theme in the first sermon of Moses. These events begin to reverse the disastrous outcome of the failure of faith at Kadesh-barnea.

The kingdoms of Sihon and Og were to the east and north of where Israel was encamped at the Jordan. Heshbon, the capital of Sihon, is preserved as Tell Hesban, 15 miles (24 km) north of where the Jordan enters the Dead Sea. Based on archaeological excavations, the actual location of the city in the days of Moses appears to have been about 7 miles (11.3 km) south of the current tell. Tell Ashterah is a site along the King's Highway in Syria, referred to as "Ashteroth-karnaim" in Genesis 14:5. It is mentioned in correspondences between Egypt and Canaan in the time of Moses in clay tablets known as the Amarna Letters (cf. Deut. 1:26–28). Edrei has been identified as Daraa, a town south of Ashtaroth near the tributary of Yarmuk. It is mentioned in Ugaritic inscriptions and in Joshua 12:4; 13:12, 31.

<span id="page-52-12"></span><span id="page-52-11"></span><span id="page-52-10"></span><span id="page-52-8"></span><span id="page-52-2"></span><span id="page-52-1"></span><span id="page-52-0"></span>Moses explains this "law" to the people. The Hebrew word *torah* carries the sense of teaching rather than legal requirement. The noun *torah* is derived from the verb *to teach* (*yarah*), which is the kind of "instruction" revealed in Exodus 24:12. On the mountain at Sinai, Moses was given the Torah on two tablets of stone to teach (*lehorot*) Israel. The noun *torah* includes civil and ritual procedures (Ex. 18:16), prophetic teaching and reproof (Isa. 1:10), moral exhortation (Prov. 1:8), and didactic narrative (Ps. 78:1). In Deuteronomy Torah is the instruction of the covenant to which all are subject; it reveals the sovereign will of God. The king must read these covenant words so that his heart will not be lifted above the people's (Deut. 17:19–20). This instruction creates equality for all people no matter one's status in society. King and people are bound to the same instruction, an ideal otherwise unknown in the time of Israel.

<span id="page-52-9"></span><span id="page-52-6"></span><span id="page-52-4"></span><span id="page-52-3"></span>1:6 Moses reminds the people of the command given at Mount Sinai to the previous generation; they were to proceed to the land formally tendered to them. At Mount Sinai, after the idolatry of the golden calf, God revealed his name to Moses to assure the beleaguered leader that he would find rest in the Promised Land (Ex. 33:14). The name Yahweh would become synonymous with the mercy of the God of the covenant (Ex. 33:19; 34:5–6; Ps. 103:7–8; Jonah 4:2). This mercy would make possible the continuation of the covenant and the promise. The fiery glory cloud of divine presence led Israel away from Mount Sinai in the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month (Num. 10:11–12). The entire retrospection that constitutes the prologue of the covenant renewal deals with Israel's response to the command to enter the land and the consequences of its lack of faith.

<span id="page-52-7"></span><span id="page-52-5"></span>1:7–8 The Land of Promise is described in terms of its regions. The "hill country of the Amorites" refers to the central highlands that will become the heartland of Israelite settlement. The Amorites will be the first peoples Israel encounters when it enters the land. The Arabah in this context is the Jordan Valley, from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. The hill country of the Shephelah is the rolling region to the west of the central highlands, which becomes low hills as it extends to the coastal plain along the seashore. The Negeb in biblical times is limited to the area beginning about 15 miles (24 km) north of Beersheba and extending south to the wilderness of Zin. The eastern part of the Negeb belongs to Seir-Edom. It is a dry area, as the term signifies. The land of Canaan extends north along the sea coast to the Lebanon mountain ranges and up the Beka Valley as far as the bend in the Euphrates River. The northern boundary of Canaan during the Hittite Empire (c. 1275 BC) was set at Lebo-hamath on the Orontes River.

<span id="page-53-5"></span><span id="page-53-1"></span>1:9–13 Moses recalls the provisions for leadership that took place at Horeb before the journey from Mount Horeb to Kadesh-barnea. He appointed chiefs to serve as officers and judges. This introduction serves as a reminder to the way Yahweh prepared the people to enter their inheritance. The extraordinary growth that necessitated the appointment of leaders was also a reminder of the fulfillment of the divine promise. This event is recorded in Exodus 18:13–27, at the occasion of a visit from Jethro, Moses' father-in-law. The appointment of chiefs is not explicitly initiated by God. Jethro advises Moses that he will be exhausted unless an organizational structure is put in place. Moses here recounts how he commanded the people to select proven leaders from among their tribes.

<span id="page-53-2"></span><span id="page-53-0"></span>"At that time" refers to the year the people camped at Horeb. Although the arrival of Jethro is placed before the giving of the covenant at Sinai in the narrative, Exodus 18:5 states that Jethro arrived with his daughter and her sons when the people had encamped at the mountain of God, and he left them immediately after the process was complete (Ex. 18:27). According to Numbers 10:29–32 Jethro left as the Israelites were preparing to leave Horeb, almost one year after they had arrived. According to Exodus 19:1 the Israelites arrived at Horeb (= Sinai) on the first day of the third month after leaving Egypt, and according to Numbers 10:11 they left Horeb in the second year on the twentieth day of the second month.

<span id="page-53-6"></span><span id="page-53-4"></span><span id="page-53-3"></span>Both Numbers and Deuteronomy are explicit regarding the need for a structure of chiefs to distribute the work of leading the people. According to biblical tradition, the number of men of military age at the time of the exodus was six hundred thousand. One person could not keep order in a multitude of that size. The "weight" (Hb. *torakh*; v. 12) included the issues of finding food and water as well as settling disputes. At the time of Isaiah the appointed festivals and ritual became a *torakh* to the Lord (Isa. 1:14). These are the only two occurrences of this noun in the Hebrew Bible, but the generic use of the term indicates the inclusive nature of the burdens involved.

<span id="page-53-10"></span><span id="page-53-9"></span><span id="page-53-8"></span><span id="page-53-7"></span>The selection of chiefs was done by the people. Those selected were previously known for their leadership ability in their respective tribes. The qualifications required men who were wise, discerning, and experienced. This is in keeping with the emphasis of wisdom in Deuteronomy. Divine revelation and keeping of the covenant are wisdom for Israel that is recognized by all the surrounding nations (Deut. 4:6, 8). Failure to follow the values of the covenant or any perversion of the truth is an obvious lack of wisdom (Deut. 16:19). "Wise, understanding, and experienced" (1:13) are the same three nouns that define the wise person in

<span id="page-54-9"></span>Ecclesiastes 9:11, which indicates that they are a standard description of wisdom. Jethro tells Moses that the chiefs must be capable men who fear God, trustworthy men who spurn ill-gotten gain. These qualities of wisdom are spoken of repeatedly in Proverbs.

<span id="page-54-8"></span><span id="page-54-4"></span><span id="page-54-2"></span>1:14–18 Chiefs of tens, fifties, hundreds, and thousands would have involved tens of thousands of leaders according to the biblical numbers of the exodus. The chiefs of the tribes are called "commanders" (Hb. *sarim*), leaders whose duties are both military and judicial. The seventy elders who usually serve as leaders for the people along with Moses are not mentioned (Ex. 24:9; Num. 11:16). Appointment of military officers to provide order and adjudicate civil disputes was a common practice in ancient societies. Pharaoh Horemheb, who lived shortly before the time usually assigned to Moses (c. 1333–1306 BC), issued a decree for the Egyptian judiciary, seeking persons of integrity and good character. An inscription from a later time found at an Israelite fortress at Yavneh-Yam (c. 630 BC) is an appeal for justice addressed to the commander (*sar*) from someone in his company.18 Israel is frequently depicted in the exodus as an army marching out of Egypt in military formation to the Promised Land. The term "hosts" (*tseba'ot*) is used to describe the people (e.g., Ex. 6:26; 7:4; 12:17, 41, 51) and typically refers the troops of an army.

<span id="page-54-7"></span><span id="page-54-0"></span>The choosing of leaders does not give the Levites a specific role. According to Chronicles, Levites have a central role when David organizes the administration over his kingdom. David appoints judges and officers to keep order in the outer districts of his kingdom from the ranks of the Levites (1 Chron. 26:29). Moses in similar manner appointed "heads" (*shoterim*) to serve with the chiefs in their judicial work (Deut. 1:15), but they were not related to the Levites. The role of these officers is usually associated with the judiciary. Record keeping would be essential to the judiciary. These officers were subordinate to the *sar*, but the work of leading and judging depended on them.

<span id="page-54-5"></span><span id="page-54-1"></span>Emphasis is placed on the impartiality of judgment, which includes the "alien" who lives among the Israelites. All persons are subject to God, who is the supreme Lawgiver. This law therefore applies equally to all people. Judges act as divine representatives; "the judgment is God's." A hierarchy in judicial affairs is part of the military organization. The most difficult cases are to be brought to Moses. Difficult cases would include those situations not known in the law, and Moses would need to consult God directly (Ex. 18:19). This is seen in practice at various times (Lev. 24:10–23; Num. 9:1–14; 15:32–36; 27:1–11; 36:1–10). The laws of the covenant Moses references Deuteronomy 1:18 must be those given at Horeb. Unique to Israel is its teaching the law to all the people. This is the goal of Moses in Deuteronomy, and it is necessary because *torah* is not limited to civil regulations; it is the integrated instruction of the covenant necessary to living a life of trust and obedience.

<span id="page-54-6"></span><span id="page-54-3"></span><sup>18</sup> Horemheb attempted to curtail corruption of officials. For his appointment of judges cf. James Henry Breasted, *Ancient Records of Egypt*, vol. 3, *Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1906), §63. For the Israelite appeal cf. J. Naveh, "A Hebrew Letter from the Seventh Century B.C.," *IEJ* 10/3 (1960): 129–139.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-55-2"></span><span id="page-55-1"></span>No other migration is comparable to that described as the circumstances in which Moses explains the covenant to a new generation of Israelites. This is a miracle no smaller in scope than the exodus from Egypt with the plagues and the crossing of the Red Sea. The events given in the superscription as the precedent to this sermon are appropriately celebrated at the great festival of the seventh month. This festival celebrated the completion of harvest and the beginning of the new agricultural year. It was known not only for the gathering of the harvest (Lev. 23:39) but also for the building of temporary shelters (Hb. *sukkot*) to commemorate the journey of Israel through the wilderness (Lev. 23:43–44), and thus was known as the Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles). This was a pilgrimage festival at which all family representatives were to go to the chosen place, and every seventh year they would renew the covenant in the reading of the Torah (Deut. 31:10–11). This celebration grew over time with the lighting of giant menorahs in the temple courtyard, allnight dancing to flutes by torch light, dawn processions ending with libations of water and wine at the bronze altar, prayers for rain and the resurrection of the dead, and people carrying fruit and waving palm branches (Mishnah, Sukkah). The wilderness wandering was a severe mercy, harsh and punishing, but was also a preservation of the covenant people to inherit the promises of the patriarchs.

<span id="page-55-3"></span><span id="page-55-0"></span>It is all too common that camps of migrants or refugees go on for a generation or more as described in this account. What is virtually impossible in all such cases is the maintenance of some sense of order and support over such a long period of time. The choosing of leaders during the migration of Israel is explicit in Exodus 18:13–27 and Numbers 11:16–30. Unique to Deuteronomy is the initiative of Moses in choosing leaders with approval of the people. Moses begins with those who have already demonstrated ability because of wisdom and experience. The proposal of governance is an extensive structure involving thousands of individuals at all its levels. It is done by appointment in the hierarchical manner of military order, though apparently with individual participation at all levels of authority. A military formation is appropriate, as Israel is marching to war once it leaves the encampment. But in a nonmilitary situation this governance provides for all matters of dispute to be appropriately adjudicated, since leaders are provided for groups as small as ten. These are integrated with ranked officials as cases become more difficult. Other officers are appointed to keep records. Supervised leadership to the level of detail described by Moses can go a long way for maintaining order in contemporary refugee camps that go on for generations. Even so, the success of maintaining order in the magnitude of the Israelite camp over the length of a full generation is supernatural. It begins with a prophet and lawgiver appointed by God, whose influence extends through others to everyone in the camp.

God cares about migrants forced out of their land of birth. They are not perfect, but that does not alter their worthiness for provision both materially and socially. The grandparents of this author were forced out of their homeland by Stalin and lost all of their property. In Canada a local agent was fraudulent and after ten

years robbed them of all their possessions a second time. Their church community was very minimally supportive of them. That legacy lives on with the children's children. Provision for migrants is one of the most critical aspects of God's work in the world today.

**<sup>19</sup>** "Then we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us. And we came to Kadeshbarnea. **20**And I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us. **<sup>21</sup>** See, the Lord your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not fear or be dismayed.' **22**Then all of you came near me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.' **23**The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe. **<sup>24</sup>**And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out. **25**And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, 'It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.'

**<sup>26</sup>** "Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. **27**And you murmured in your tents and said, 'Because the Lord hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. **28**Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there." ' **29**Then I said to you, 'Do not be in dread or afraid of them. **30**The Lord your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, **<sup>31</sup>** and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.' **32**Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the Lord your God, **33**who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.

**<sup>34</sup>** "And the Lord heard your words and was angered, and he swore, **<sup>35</sup>** 'Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers, **<sup>36</sup>** except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the Lord!' **37**Even with me the Lord was angry on your account and said, 'You also shall not go in there. **<sup>38</sup>** Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. **39**And as for your

little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it. **40**But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.'

**<sup>41</sup>** "Then you answered me, 'We have sinned against the Lord. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.' And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country. **42**And the Lord said to me, 'Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.' **<sup>43</sup>** So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the Lord and presumptuously went up into the hill country. **44**Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah. **45**And you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord did not listen to your voice or give ear to you. **<sup>46</sup>** So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.

2"Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the Lord told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir."

<span id="page-57-1"></span><span id="page-57-0"></span>In the second year from the time the Israelites arrived at Horeb, in the second month and twentieth day, the cloud lifted from the "tabernacle of the testimony" (Num. 10:11). Divine guidance brought them into the vast wilderness of Paran, located at the entrance to the Promised Land, north of the wilderness of Sinai. Moses sent the spies from Paran, specifically from Kadesh (Num. 13:3, 26). The site identified as Kadesh-barnea in the twentieth century AD is located at 'Ain el-Qudeirat in the wadi of el-'Ain, near the juncture of a road leading from Suez to Beersheba to Hebron and the road branching off from the "way of the sea" (Isa. 9:1) near Raphia, leading to Elath on the Gulf of Aqaba (the "way to the hill country of the Amorites"; Deut 1:19).19 The biblical Kadesh was somewhere in this area, on the border of the Promised Land.

<span id="page-57-5"></span><span id="page-57-4"></span><span id="page-57-3"></span>In his first speech Moses takes the new generation back to their original journey to the Promised Land. Those listening are the children of those who died in the wilderness. The unbelieving people of that former generation thought they would be given up as plunder to the Amorites, but God had determined that these were the ones who would qualify to enter the land (Deut. 1:39). In just eleven days the Israelites arrived in Paran (v. 2), well organized and fully prepared to enter the Promised Land. They were ordered in military formation; they could break camp and travel as a disciplined army. Leadership was in place to deal with inevitable

David Ussishkin et al., "Kadesh-Barnea: In the Bible and on the Ground," *BAR* 41/5 (September–October 2015): 36–44. It is an area of four springs in total with an abundance of Midianite pottery and a massive eighth-century, eight-tower fortress. The culture of Kadesh is an argument for locating Mount Sinai in Midian, an area just south of the modern Jordanian border. This was the home of Moses when he left Egypt and would have been a natural destination for Israel.

troubles in the travel of such a large multitude. In light of the power of the Lord, nothing stood in the way of their continuing their journey to the place promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

<span id="page-58-2"></span><span id="page-58-1"></span>These words of Moses are addressed to the assembly of Israel in the same situation as their forebears'. Nothing could be more relevant to them than knowing clearly the failure of faith that brought about the disastrous judgment on those who had sworn allegiance to God at the foot of Mount Sinai. Kadesh-barnea had been the scene of many critical events in their short history. Miriam, sister of Moses and Aaron, died there (Num. 20:1), and there the rock gushed water for the complaining assembly (Num. 20:2–13). The lack of faith Moses displayed on this occasion excluded him from entrance into the Promised Land. But neither of these latter events should have happened. The real disaster of Kadesh-barnea was the faithlessness of the covenant people when the spies gave their report of a land flowing with milk and honey. There need not have been death outside the Promised Land or exclusion from it. Trust in Yahweh, the Most Holy One, who was present with them in covenant relationship, had been fatally compromised. The curses of the covenant oath manifested God's loyalty to them just as much as his merciful acts did.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-58-4"></span>1:19–21 The Israelites journeyed from Horeb directly to the "hill country of the Amorites," a generic designation of the people of Canaan and Syria. The term *amurru* occurs in Old Akkadian sources of Mesopotamia meaning "west," most frequently as an ethnic designation of those peoples bordering the Mediterranean Sea. They were foreign to the great civilizations of the East in culture as well as language. Amorites in Deuteronomy are listed as one of seven to ten nations living in the land promised to Abraham's descendants (cf. Gen. 15:19–21). In the time of Moses there was still a kingdom of Amurru in the upper Orontes Valley, but the mighty nations of Canaan were independent of them. The last occurrences of the title "king of the Amorites" refers to Sihon in Heshbon (Num. 21:21, 26), who was conquered by the Israelites.

<span id="page-58-3"></span><span id="page-58-0"></span>Moses constantly reminds the Israelites that their journeys were "as the Lord our God commanded us." The Lord was always the commander-in-chief of this unusual army on the march. With the Lord as the commander-in-chief, there was no doubt over the outcome of their destiny. This is the land "the Lord our God is giving us." For this reason Moses gave the charge to go up and take the land without being terrified. The term "dismayed" is from the Hebrew *khathath*, which has the sense of being emotionally horrified—not just afraid but filled with terror. Moses was alert to the danger that emotions might erode trust in God, particularly those of paralyzing fear.

<span id="page-59-6"></span><span id="page-59-5"></span><span id="page-59-1"></span><span id="page-59-0"></span>1:22–23 In Deuteronomy Moses describes the sending of spies as an initiative of the people. In Numbers 13:2 the Lord commands Moses to send men to scout out the land. The Samaritan version of the Pentateuch, preserved into medieval times, harmonizes these accounts by inserting Deuteronomy 1:20–23a at the beginning of Numbers 13. In Numbers the Hebrew idiom says that God commanded Moses with the words "Send for yourself men to scout the land." A Hebrew Midrash explains that making the men a choice of Moses shows that the Lord disapproved of the whole procedure. But this is inferring too much from an idiom. The request to reconnoiter the land in preparation for entry was good procedure, not in itself an indication of lack of faith. Dependence on God for the success in this venture did not preclude the necessity of proper preparation for such a large camp to proceed into hostile territory. The report of the scouts had potential to be an encouragement to enter the Promised Land. Finally, the dynamic between divine and human initiative is ambiguous not only in language but also in human experience. Awareness of utter dependence on God does not preclude using the resources God has given us.

<span id="page-59-7"></span><span id="page-59-4"></span><span id="page-59-3"></span><span id="page-59-2"></span>1:24–25 Numbers 13:4–16 provides a detailed enumeration of the individuals from each tribe sent to scout the land. The scouts came to the "Valley of Eshcol" near the city of Hebron (Num. 13:22–23). The Hebrew word *'eshkol* means "grape cluster," an appropriate name, as the area was well known for its viticulture, an important part of the economy of the area to this day. The spies returned with a single grape cluster so large it had to be carried with a pole frame. Numbers 13:21 provides additional details of the forty-day mission of the scouts, reporting that they traveled the entire land, from the wilderness of Zin, where they began, to Lebo-hamath at the sources of the Orontes River in Syria, the farthest extent of the Promised Land. This speech of Moses is a very limited summary of the forty days, expressing the most important aspect of their findings. The land was rich beyond what they could have imagined. The details of how they would travel and how the campaign would be conducted were understood to be part of the affirmation that the Lord was giving them the land. Up until this time the glory cloud was present to direct their journey, and, as Moses says in Deuteronomy 1:33, it should have been their expectation that such divine guidance would direct them in their inheritance of the land.

<span id="page-59-9"></span><span id="page-59-8"></span>1:26–28 Moses moves directly from the potential of the inheritance to the response of the people. Responsibility for the failure to enter the land does not fall on the <span id="page-60-2"></span>report of the scouts. Their report necessarily included an account of the people of the land and a description of their fortifications (Num. 13:28–29). This should not have resulted in faithlessness on the part of those who had seen the mighty military of Egypt sunk in the Red Sea just two years earlier. The people, however, were quick to lay the blame on the scouts: "Our brothers have made our hearts melt." But this is no excuse; they had quite simply "rebelled against the command of the Lord."

<span id="page-60-8"></span><span id="page-60-5"></span>In terms of military strategy, there was plenty to fear. The report of fortifications and armies left the people distraught: what kind of place was this? The Anakim are the legendary giant indigenous peoples of Canaan. The Hebrew term *ʻnq* refers to the neck, but it is uncertain if this was the basis for naming these intimidating people in terms of their size or strength. According to Joshua 15:13 and 21:11 Anak was the son of Arba, the founder of Kiriath-arba, or Hebron. Arba was regarded as the greatest of the Anakim (Josh. 14:15), whose territory extended farther into the hill country of Judah (Josh. 11:21–22). The scouts described the Anakim as descendants of the Nephilim, the antediluvian offspring of the sons of God and daughters of men (Num. 13:33), though they cannot have meant actual physical descent, since those Nephilim did not survive the flood.

<span id="page-60-9"></span><span id="page-60-7"></span><span id="page-60-6"></span><span id="page-60-4"></span><span id="page-60-3"></span><span id="page-60-0"></span>The heroic status of the antediluvian Nephilim described in Genesis 6:4 motivated the Greek translators to call them "giants" (*gigantes*), which is the description that has made its way into some contemporary translations. The word *gigantes* was used in Greek for a savage race destroyed by the gods. Because of these associations, the Greek translation also renders *ʻanakim* in Deuteronomy 1:28 as *gigantes*. Some of these giant people survived in Philistine cities. Goliath of Gath and the other powerful soldiers killed by David and his troops in 2 Samuel 21:16–22 are the last mention of these giants. The scouts apparently provided a very graphic description of the inhabitants of Canaan and their soldiers, which contributed to the terror felt by the people. They used this association for rhetorical effect, much as "Huns" was used to designate Germans during the two world wars. Huns were the confederate tribes capable of resisting the Romans in eastern Europe.

<span id="page-60-1"></span>Some sense of the military power and fortifications of Canaan at this time is provided by the Amarna Tablets of Egypt.20 These letters describe much of Canaan beginning in the fourteenth century BC. Some tablets are correspondence between city kingdoms of Canaan and the pharaohs of Egypt before and during the Ramesside period, the time in which the city of Raamses was built (Ex. 1:11). These letters describe powerful kingdoms able to resist the mighty armies of Egypt or the Hittites. About a half century later Pharaoh Merneptah, son of Rameses II, erected a victory stele in which he describes his victories over powerful Canaanite kingdoms.21 These cities and their military control of large territories, such as the

A complete translation is provided by Samuel Mercer, ed., *The Tell El-Amarna Tablets*, 2 vols. (Toronto: MacMillan, 1939).

<sup>21</sup> A description of the stela by Merneptah (1211–1202 BC) is provided in T. C. Mitchell, *Biblical Archaeology: Documents from the British Museum* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988), document 11.

kings in Ashkelon, Gezer, Jerusalem, and Shechem, were what the spies observed and reported.

<span id="page-61-4"></span>1:29–33 Moses reminds the people that the Lord was their guide. He was the warrior who would topple walls, just as he sunk the Egyptians in the Red Sea. He was the one who had sustained them in the wilderness. There was no reason for them to "be in dread." But this exhortation had no effect. The people did not have faith in the God who had guided them thus far. The glory cloud may have been present to their eyes as Moses spoke. This event took place at night (Num. 14:1), which may be why Moses uses the unusual order of guidance "in fire by night and in the cloud by day." Their trust in God had shifted to trust in military ability, a categorical failure to keep the covenant just made at Sinai.

<span id="page-61-5"></span><span id="page-61-2"></span>1:34–40 The oath at Mount Sinai is countered by the oath God takes against every individual who has spoken in denial of the divine deliverance. This "evil generation" would never see the good land reported by the spies. "Evil" is a negative word used to describe unbelief. The Hebrew *raʻ* has a broad semantic range, including anything displeasing, harmful, painful, inferior, disagreeable, violent, or criminal. The nuances of the English word *evil* are appropriate to this situation. Denial of an oath and sundering relationship with God is a profound evil. Although such individuals may appear to be morally good, they have denied the essential requirement of healthy human relationships. The divine judgment is just.

<span id="page-61-7"></span><span id="page-61-6"></span><span id="page-61-3"></span>Caleb was the exception to the rebellious generation denied entrance to the Promised Land. His commitment to the Lord was uncompromised, since he had fully kept the vow of the covenant. A parenthetical note, not part of the address to the people, explains the circumstances of Moses and Joshua. Moses tells the people that God was angry with him "on your account" (Deut. 1:37), a point repeated at 3:26; 4:21. Moses is denied entrance to the Promised Land because of his own sin as reported in Numbers 20:1–13. Psalm 106:32–33 includes this reference with the testing that took place at Meribah, but the parallel lines are part of a litany of failures. The punishment of Moses in Deuteronomy is not related to the rock incident, which may have occurred as late as the fortieth year. The failure of Moses to enter the Promised Land in the first speech of Deuteronomy is related to the mission of the scouts. Nothing implicates Moses in the sending of the scouts or their mission. The problem is caused by his association with the people. The unfaithfulness of the people not only prevented Moses from entering the land at Kadesh-barnea but also led to forty years of wandering with the fateful consequences that ensued. Moses would be condemned to die with them in the wilderness. Joshua of the next generation would be the general to bring them into the Promised Land.

<span id="page-61-1"></span><span id="page-61-0"></span>Joshua was the only one of the elders designated to ascend the mountain with Moses to receive the tablets of the covenant (Ex. 24:13). He is named without introduction as the chief of the generals in the war against Amalek in Exodus 17:8–9, indicating that he was already distinguished at that time. As commander-in-chief, <span id="page-62-6"></span><span id="page-62-1"></span>he would be the one to lead the conquest of Canaan. Joshua was divinely designated as successor to Moses in Numbers 27:18 because he was a man of spirit (*ruakh*), a term that includes courage, skill, strength, and commitment to God as granted by the Holy Spirit. These qualities were exemplified in the war against Amalek. His close association with Moses may have prevented him from being a spokesman for the spies. Caleb silenced the people in their protest and urged them to follow the divine leading (Num. 13:30), but his words were of no effect. The other spies spread calumnies, resulting in a mutiny against Moses and Aaron. Joshua joined Caleb in exhorting the people to trust the Lord because the people of Canaan were their prey, but they were almost stoned for their efforts (Num. 14:6–10). Thus the people are urged to be loyal and supportive of Joshua as the one to bring Israel into its inheritance.

<span id="page-62-2"></span>Direct address to the people resumes with the words of the people who had protested. They claimed their innocent children, unable to determine right from wrong, would become plunder. The reality was that these children would enter the land as a possession. The rebellious people were to turn and march into the wilderness, the exact same order given at Horeb (Deut. 1:7), but now in the opposite direction and destiny.

<span id="page-62-8"></span><span id="page-62-7"></span>1:41–45 The rebellion of the people was followed by further rebellion in defiantly denying the divine order. They presumptuously armed themselves with the belief they could do the very thing they had just feared and may have "thought it easy to go up" (Hb. *hawan*). The verb *hawan*, otherwise unknown in biblical Hebrew, was treated by the rabbis as a performance utterance, a declaration of preparedness for battle. It might have the sense of "ready, set, march." Once more the people are warned: victory is possible only if God is in the battle, a declaration found in the formula for advance in Numbers 10:35–36. The ark was a type of chariot throne preceding the army. When the ark halted, the hosts of the Lord, namely, the thousands of Israel, would cease their march. In this instance of rebellion, however, the ark never left the camp (Num. 14:42–45). The Amorites swarmed them; their soldiers were pertinacious, ferocious, and numerous as bees.

<span id="page-62-5"></span><span id="page-62-4"></span><span id="page-62-3"></span><span id="page-62-0"></span>The Israelites were defeated "in Seir as far as Hormah." The name Hormah derives from the verb *kharam* (cf. Introduction: Theology of Deuteronomy: Fidelity to the Covenant), a place like Jericho, dedicated irrevocably to the Lord by its removal from the sphere of the common. Numbers 21:3 explains the meaning of the name and identifies its location as being near Arad, the southern part of Canaan that was the entrance to the Promised Land. Seir is the area of Edom. There is no explanation for why the attackers would have been in Seir or why they would have pursued the Israelites to Hormah in the direction of Canaan. Numbers 14:45 says only that the Israelites were pursued as far as Hormah. The Targums, an Aramaic translation of the OT, resolve the issue by taking the name as a common noun. The Israelites were pursued "unto destruction," implying that the Israelites fled from the Amorites into Seir, where they were caught and crushed.

<span id="page-63-3"></span><span id="page-63-2"></span>1:46–2:1 The exact time spent at Kadesh is not specified. The expression "many days" can refer to a period ranging from days to years. The time at Kadesh cannot have been long, because according to Deuteronomy 2:14 the Israelites began the final phase of their wandering thirty-eight years after they left Kadesh. The "days that you remained there" seem to refer to the time of their return from battle. A delay would have been a further act of disobedience, as Moses was instructed that they should move toward the Red Sea. The "many days we traveled around Mount Seir" must have been most of the thirty-eight years.

The site of el 'Ain el-Qudeirat, identified as Kadesh, was extensively excavated until 1982, at which time the territory was returned to Egypt as part of a peace agreement with Israel. It features a massive fortress with walls 16 feet (5 m) thick and eight projecting towers. This fortress was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar as part of his campaign in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The site is near the junction of a road leading from Suez to Beersheba and the road branching from the Via Maris near el-Arish leading to Elath (Gulf of Aqaba). The history of the site before the tenth century BC is not known. Pottery shards that date to the twelfth and eleventh centuries BC may be indicative of earlier occupations.

Some of the pottery discovered at this site is known as Qurayyah Painted Ware, named after a site in northwest Saudi Arabia, where it was found and identified. The presence of this pottery indicates strong commercial and cultural connections with the Hejaz in the northwest Arabian Peninsula. Hejaz is the territory of Midian, which was thriving with settlements at the time of the exodus. At Qurayyah a major fortified citadel has been discovered: a walled village and extensive irrigation systems. Midianite- or Hejaz-ware spread out into southern Transjordan and sites near Elath. *Timnaʻ*, a site north of the Gulf of Aqaba known for its copper mines, is notable for this pottery.

Moses was married to a Midianite and lived in that territory the greatest part of his life. The Midianites ranged over a wide area including northwest Arabia, southern Transjordan, the Arabah, and into the Negeb. Midianites appear to be more a league of tribes than a limited geographical area. Israelites encountered Midianites, as related in the Balaam story (Num. 22:4). Their wandering in the territory of Mount Seir seems to have been in this area known to Moses.

#### <span id="page-63-0"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-63-1"></span>Trust and belief are related, but they must not be equated. The words "you did not believe the Lord your God" (Deut. 1:32) translate the Hebrew verb *'aman*. The English word *amen* commonly used in prayer is derived from this verb. The lexeme carries the sense of something reliable or trustworthy. Used of persons, it denotes the exercise of trust. Trust in a person requires a belief in the character of that person, which provides the basis of trust, but belief does not assure that trust will be exercised.

<span id="page-63-4"></span>The verb *'aman* is used by Isaiah to warn Ahaz during the Syrian crisis (Isa. 7:1–9). Ahaz, king of Jerusalem, was threatened by two greater powers, Damascus <span id="page-64-2"></span>and Samaria (Syria and Israel). The scheme of their two kings, Rezin and Pekah, was to form an alliance against the advancing army of the Assyrians to resist invasion, replacing Ahaz with Tab'al. Ahaz feared these two kings more than the king of Assyria. His plan was to ally with Assyria to resist the neighboring kings threatening to take over his throne. This scheme was not wise; as Isaiah said to Ahaz, you are hiring the razor that will shave you (Isa. 7:20), a reference to prisoners of war humiliated via stripping and shaving. Ahaz had offered payment to Assyria to protect him, but they in turn would conquer him (2 Kings 16:7–8). The only hope for Ahaz was to trust in God. Isaiah warns Ahaz with a play on the verb forms of *ʾaman*: "If you are not firm in faith [*lo' ta'aminu*], you will not be firm at all [*lo' te'amenu*]" (Isa. 7:9). Ahaz was not firm in his faith, and his kingdom was plundered by the Assyrians. The sign of *ʻimmanu'el* came upon him (Isa. 8:8), but not in a positive way. God was with Ahaz by sending the Assyrians to conquer him.

<span id="page-64-3"></span><span id="page-64-1"></span><span id="page-64-0"></span>The Israelites at Kadesh were in a similar situation. Their need was to be firm in faith, which was their only security. The sign they had followed for deliverance was before them in the presence of the glory cloud. They did not exercise faith, though no doubt all of them believed God could deliver them from the Canaanite cities just as he had from Pharaoh. The result of not being firm in faith was that they were not firm at all; they died in the wilderness.

<span id="page-64-4"></span>The call of the NT to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is no different. The Greek verb *pisteuō* carries the same connotations as the Hebrew verb *'aman.* Whoever trusts ( *pas ho pisteuōn*) in the son of God will not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16). God is not merely asking for belief that he has sent his Son but is calling for commitment to his Son, a trust in him. This is not to suggest that there can never be doubts. Doubt is part of the very nature of faith. The need to trust in another is an admittance of uncertainty due to lack of knowledge. Faith is to act despite doubts that may arise. Belief requires faith, an act of trust that overcomes feelings of uncertainty.

To put this in mundane ordinary terms, it is not enough to believe an airplane will fly; to travel by air, one needs to board the plane. It is not enough to believe that a partner can be trusted to show love for an entire lifetime. Marriage is possible only if commitment is made to trust that partner, though there are many things neither person knows in making a lifelong commitment.

Human finitude is such that belief does not in itself govern conduct. Many people believe airplanes will fly because they see it all the time but will not actually get on one and travel by air. In matters of faith, this dichotomy is all too prevalent; confession of belief is not commitment in faith. This was the problem of Israel at Kadesh-barnea—they believed. They were so sure of their belief that they attacked after they were told they would fail. Belief does not always behave in a reasonable manner, as proven in this event. Faithfulness is a journey, and never a journey without its failures.

### <span id="page-65-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 2:2–15

**<sup>2</sup>**Then the Lord said to me, **<sup>3</sup>** 'You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward **<sup>4</sup>** and command the people, "You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful. **<sup>5</sup>**Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. **6**You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink. **7**For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands.

' **<sup>8</sup>** So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.

"And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab. **<sup>9</sup>**And the Lord said to me, 'Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.' **<sup>10</sup>** (The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim. **<sup>11</sup>** Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. **12**The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the Lord gave to them.) **<sup>13</sup>** 'Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.'

#### *Section Overview: Journey through Edom; End of Wilderness Journeys*

<span id="page-65-1"></span>This part of the speech constitutes the critical transition from the generation of the wilderness wanderings to the generation that would enter the Promised Land. All the warriors of the wilderness wanderings had died (Deut. 2:14). There is some irony in this statement, as those who were to be God's warriors had refused to fight. They feared for the lives of their children, but the children are now the ones to enter the Promised Land successfully.

Moses is providing encouragement and instruction to the new generation. God had allotted the territories of Edom and Moab, enabling them to displace the giants that preceded them. And God will do for Israel what he had done for other nations. Further, because these territories were given to other peoples, Israel must ensure they do not initiate conflict in any fashion.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-66-7"></span>2:2–8a The Israelites are instructed to make their way north from the area of their wandering after the death of that entire generation. This requires them to pass through the areas of Edom and Moab on the east side of the Jordan rather than entering from Kadesh-barnea as originally intended. The earliest references to the land and people of Edom come from Egyptian texts. One of the Amarna Letters of Egypt mentions the "lands of Seir."22 Egyptian papyri report that Shasu tribes23 of Mount Seir crossed the border into Egypt during the reigns of Seti II (1214–1208 BC) and Rameses III (1198–1166). During this time Edom appears to be a territory of tribal chieftains, nondynastic leaders as in the days of the judges in Israel, and the time of Edomite chiefs is remembered in the genealogies of Esau (Gen. 36:40–43; 1 Chron. 1:51–54). The armies of Israel during the exodus would have been an inherent threat to Edomite tribes, which explains the warning to maintain peace with them.

<span id="page-66-3"></span><span id="page-66-2"></span><span id="page-66-1"></span>Israel is warned not to engage in battle with their brothers in Edom because they will not inherit so much as a footstep of their land. Kings ruled Edom before the time of Saul (Gen. 36:31–39; 1 Chron. 1:43–50). When Israel became a kingdom, the words of Isaac's blessing to Esau began to materialize: "You shall serve your brother" (Gen. 27:40). David reduced Edom to vassalage (2 Sam. 8:13–14), ending its royal house and placing garrisons in the land. This fulfilled the ancient prophecy to Rebekah that "the older shall serve the younger" (Gen. 25:23). Edom became bitter rivals with Israel, but it was never forgotten that Edom was a brother and that the territory of Seir was divinely ordained for Edom.

<span id="page-66-5"></span><span id="page-66-0"></span>Much of the exodus journey is not known. Numbers 20:14–21 recounts the request of Moses at Kadesh to pass through the land of Edom to reach the territory of Jordan for entrance into the Promised Land. The request was refused, so Israel was forced to detour. The time of this journey from Kadesh is given only as "the first month" (Num. 20:1). This would seem to be in the fortieth year, because the detailed itinerary of the wilderness march places Kadesh before the stop at

<span id="page-66-6"></span><span id="page-66-4"></span><sup>22</sup> Mercer, *Tell El-Amarna* Tablets, §288, line 26. Cf. comment on 1:26–28 for a description of the tablets.

<sup>23</sup> Shasu is an Akkadian term for migrant and plundering tribes active across Canaan in the Late Bronze Age.

<span id="page-67-7"></span><span id="page-67-4"></span><span id="page-67-1"></span>which Aaron died in the fifth month (Num. 33:36–39).24 Deuteronomy makes no reference to a return to Kadesh, assuming this is the same place as Kadesh-barnea. In Numbers the journey continues to Wadi Zered at the border of Moab on the southeast end of the Dead Sea, passing through the north side of Edom (Num. 21:10–12). There is insufficient geographical or chronological information to know how these traditions relate to each other. Numbers 20–21 is written to show that, despite the continual murmuring of the Israelites in the new generation, God provided Israel with water, healing, and victory. The two chapters illustrate the rebellion of the leaders and the people, respectively (Num. 20:9–11; 21:5). This topical arrangement integrates several events.

<span id="page-67-8"></span><span id="page-67-3"></span>2:8b–12 The next stage of the journey took the Israelites across the highlands east of the Dead Sea. The territory of Moab at this time consisted of the area from Wadi Zered to Wadi Arnon. A wadi (Hb. *nahal*) is a ravine between steep slopes such as those surrounding the Dead Sea. These geographical features are well known for flash flooding, and many maintain steady streams during the rainy season. Wadi Zered is a perennial stream, about 35 miles (56 km) long, falling about 3,900 feet (1,200 m) into the Dead Sea. The Wadi Arnon is also a perennial stream whose tributaries drain much of the Moabite Plateau. The plateau is drained by Wadi Heidan to the north and modern Wadi Mujib (biblical Arnon) to the south. The southern stream flows northwest about 15 miles (24 km), then runs an equal distance west, emptying into the midpoint of the Dead Sea. The outflow of the Arnon is greatly increased by Wadi Heidan, which merges with it about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the Dead Sea. The depth of the Arnon Valley varies from 1,300 feet (400 m) to 2,300 feet (700 m). Its length and depth made travel difficult, forcing the King's Highway far inland to bypass the western edge of the escarpment and the deep gorges descending to the Dead Sea.

<span id="page-67-10"></span><span id="page-67-5"></span>God had given "Ar" to the "people of Lot for a possession." Ar was either a territory or a city in Moab, and it represents the whole country (Deut. 2:18, 29). It was burned by Sihon (Num. 21:28), and it was possibly the capital city of Moab (Isa. 15:1). It is likely to be identified with the "city of Moab" (*'ir moab*) on the Arnon, the northern border (Num. 22:36). *ʻAr*, *ʻir*, and *kir* are all terms that mean "city."

<span id="page-67-12"></span><span id="page-67-11"></span><span id="page-67-9"></span><span id="page-67-6"></span>Several times Moses describes the previous history of the lands Israel must pass by (Deut. 2:20–23; 3:9–11). The purpose of these historical asides is to assure Israel of the reliability of God's promise to grant Israel victory over the inhabitants of the land of Canaan. The factual nature of this description gives it the appearance of a parenthetical note (2:10–12). The indigenous people of the Transjordan are already given in the account of the wars of Abraham (Gen. 14:5–6). The Emim were given their name by the Moabites, who found them fearful (*ʾemah* = "dread" or "terror"). In Genesis they are said to dwell in Shaveh-kiriathaim, to the north of the Arnon

<span id="page-67-2"></span><span id="page-67-0"></span><sup>24</sup> The narrative in Numbers 20–21 appears to be thematically arranged and is very difficult to interpret chronologically. A full discussion of the structure of these chapters is provided by Jacob Milgrom, "Excursus 55," in *Numbers*,JPSTC (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1990), 463–467. The interaction with Edom and the wars with the Canaanites are not arranged as a sequence of events.

<span id="page-68-9"></span><span id="page-68-5"></span><span id="page-68-4"></span><span id="page-68-0"></span>(Gen. 14:5). They were of extraordinary size, like the Anakim or the Rephaim. The Anakim were the autochthonous people of Canaan (Deut. 1:28; cf. comment on 1:26–28). *Rephaim* has two meanings in the OT: (1) shades or ghosts in the place of the dead (Prov. 2:18; Ps. 88:11) and (2) ancient inhabitants of Canaan. The derivation of these meanings can only be inferred. An Ugaritic psalm names Rapha as a god over the capital cities of Og in Bashan.25 In other texts, Rephaim constitute an elite warrior guild of giant soldiers associated with the Jordan valley. In Ugaritic writings the term *rup'm* describes the privileged dead or royal ancestors who live in the underworld, but sometimes a living ruler is among their number. It seems devotees of the god Rapha were famous warriors who once held territory in the region of Bashan. Such hero ancestors become the Rephaim of the netherworld, but they are encountered as the giant peoples of Canaan.

<span id="page-68-1"></span>The previous inhabitants of Seir were the Horites (Gen. 14:6), a name often identified with the Hurrians. These were a non-Semitic people who emerge in history in the third millennium BC in the northern part of Mesopotamia. They gradually spread throughout the Levant, leaving a lasting cultural legacy. The Egyptians in the time of Moses refer to Canaan as the "land of Hurru." However, it is unlikely that biblical Horites were Hurrians. Horites never appear in the pre-Israelite peoples of Canaan, and they are never located west of the Jordan. In the Bible they are related to Seir (Gen. 36:20–21).

<span id="page-68-7"></span><span id="page-68-6"></span><span id="page-68-3"></span>2:13–15 Moses again directly addresses the people with the command to cross the Zered. The crossing of the Zered was the transition to a new era. The oath of God at Kadesh-barnea was now fulfilled (Deut. 1:35). Every individual that had rebelled in refusing to trust God to enter the land had died. It is repeatedly emphasized that the rebels "had perished." In some cases the judgment of the Lord was direct: "to destroy them from the camp." Entrance into Moab was to exit the wilderness of judgment in the environs of Mount Seir.

<span id="page-68-8"></span>One of the modern concerns of justice is the rights of aboriginals. This is a concern Moses relates to Israel as it leaves the wilderness for the Land of Promise. The theological concept exhibited in this passage is that God allots the lands of the nations as expressed in Deuteronomy 32:8. In the case of Israel the displacement of the Canaanites is described as a divine judgment: the promise to Abraham was contingent on the time when the iniquity of the Amorites was complete (Gen. 15:16). Israel was to pass by Edom and Moab peacefully because God was not granting to them any of that territory. God had granted the descendants of Lot the territory of the Emim and the descendants of Esau the territory of the Horites. The entitlement of Esau to its land is compared to the entitlement of Israel to the land

Ugarit was an ancient port in northern Syria. In 1929, about fifteen hundred tablets of royal archives were discovered. Its language is very close to Hebrew. The tablets date during the Late Bronze Age, approximately the time of the exodus (1400–1300 BC).

<span id="page-69-0"></span>God is giving them (Deut. 2:12). This would imply a judgment on those peoples, just as God is now judging Canaan in the emergence of Israel.

These historical notes in Deuteronomy make clear that the concept of indigenous rights is not simple. Every land has a history; the rights of a people to its land are dependent on an interpretation of the history that has taken place. Claims for independence within a country, claims to the rights of the territory of another country, or claims for the termination of a country are all based on interpretations of the past. These historical notes in Deuteronomy are a reminder of the importance of some knowledge of the past so that a nation may be responsible in the present. Interpretations of the past in turn are based on theology or some philosophy of history. The statements made in this passage assume a divine order among these peoples and are an important example of the fact that all disputes of the modern world are of the same order. There is no self-evident justice. All political assessments rely on a metanarrative, to use a postmodern term—some philosophy of social and economic order to justify claims of rights in the present.

The historical notes of this passage should inspire humility rather than selfrighteous justification as Israel sets out to inherit its own claims to territory. Humility is not the first characteristic that springs to priority in secular-minded thinking, which should be a sobering thought for Christians. A sovereign God rules over human kingdoms and gives them to whomsoever he wills, as Nebuchadnezzar states so eloquently in his account of being humiliated to the point of being like an animal. The builder of one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world concludes with a doxology in Daniel 4:35:

<span id="page-69-1"></span> All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, "What have you done?"

Political action may be appropriate, but it should by no means be presumptuous; we should not be surprised when those who share faith in divine sovereignty differ over the resolution of territorial claims. Humans do not build empires that endure by their own sagacity or power.

**<sup>16</sup>** "So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people, **<sup>17</sup>** the Lord said to me, **<sup>18</sup>** 'Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar. **19**And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.' **<sup>20</sup>** (It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim— **<sup>21</sup>** a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites,*<sup>1</sup>* and they dispossessed them and settled in their place, **<sup>22</sup>** as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day. **23**As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.) **<sup>24</sup>** 'Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle. **25**This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'

**<sup>26</sup>** "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, **<sup>27</sup>** 'Let me pass through your land.

#### *Section Overview: Command to Conquer; Defeat of Sihon*

Passage through Moab brought Israel into contact with the nations of Transjordan. The territory immediately north of Moab was the kingdom of Sihon at Heshbon. Israel did not encounter the Ammonites; their territory was to the east and north of the kingdom of Sihon. The Ammonites were also related to Israel, and they had a divinely allotted territory. Moses discusses Philistia (the "Caphtorim") in association with Ammon, which is both a comparison and a contrast. As with Edom, Moab, and Ammon, the present peoples of Philistia had displaced others that lived there previously. The Philistines were not related to Israel, but they would be neighbors. Like the other Canaanite peoples, their territory could be subject to displacement by Israel.

Sihon and Og represented two powerful kingdoms in the Transjordan who stood in the way of Israel's engagement in the occupation of Canaan. Moses here recalls the first of Israel's conquests as the new generation began to enter the blessings of the covenant.

<span id="page-71-3"></span><span id="page-71-2"></span><span id="page-71-1"></span><span id="page-71-0"></span>2:16–23 The Israelites journeyed beyond the land of Moab into the territory of Ammon. Ammonites were also related to Israel as descendants of Ben-ammi ("son of my people"; Gen. 19:38 ESV mg.), the son of Lot by one of his daughters (Gen. 19:30–38). They occupied the territory of the Zamzummim between the Rivers Arnon and Jabbok. Zamzummim appears to be an imitation of speech, a foreign tongue that sounds like buzzing. The chief town of the Ammonites was Rabbah, or Rabbath-ammon, and was remembered as the home of the sarcophagus of Og, king of Bashan (Deut. 3:11). The preservation of this trophy indicates some connection with an earlier culture. The city was located near powerful springs that are the source of the Jabbok. The Jabbok flows north, then westerly, turning due west in an increasingly deep gorge in the direction of Shechem. It enters the Jordan just north of Adam. It is about 60 miles (95 km) in distance from its sources to the Jordan and is a perennial stream known as Zarqa ("blue river"). The upper course of the river separated Ammon to the east from the kingdom of Sihon. The lower course of the river was the southern boundary of the kingdom of Og to the north.

The Israelites did not journey near the area of Philistia, even though they were not forbidden to conquer it. Moses includes it as another example of the displacement of autochthonous people by newcomers. The "Avvim" are named <span id="page-72-9"></span><span id="page-72-8"></span><span id="page-72-0"></span>as living near Philistia in Joshua 13:3, but they are otherwise unknown. They may have been herdsmen like the Ishmaelites, who also lived in unprotected villages. The Philistines arrived from Caphtor (Gen. 10:14; Jer. 47:4; Amos 9:7), an island or coastland in the area of the Aegean. It is often taken to be Crete, as the Philistines are called "Cherethites" or Cretans (Zeph. 2:5). The Philistines were among the Sea Peoples from the Aegean region who invaded the area east of the Mediterranean. They are first mentioned in temple inscriptions of Rameses III in the twelfth century BC.

<span id="page-72-7"></span><span id="page-72-6"></span>2:24–25 Sihon was an Amorite king and is known only from the scriptural record. He ruled the territory east of Jericho from the city of Heshbon. The city guarded the northern edge of the Moabite plain, where a southern tributary to Wadi Hesban cuts down sharply toward the Jordan River about 15 miles (24 km) farther west. The kingdom of Sihon extended from the boundary of Moab on the Arnon in the south beyond the Jabbok in the north, including Gilead (Josh. 12:2–3). Its southwestern point included the way of Beth-jeshimoth, down to the slopes of Pisgah on the Dead Sea. The southern half of Sihon's kingdom consisted of the tableland (Hb. *mishor*) of Moab from Heshbon to the Arnon. An Amorite war taunt against Moab in Numbers 21:27–29 tells of Sihon's conquest of this territory. The Israelite conquest of Canaan would be launched from this territory, making possession of it critical. Israelite claim to the territory was based on its being under Amorite control at the time of the conquest. Through Moses God said, "I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite." In Deuteronomy the conquest begins with the crossing of the Arnon into the territory of Sihon. Six imperatives emphasize the divine mandate to conquer as Moses resumes his address to Israel: Up! Move! Cross the Arnon! Begin! Occupy! Engage in battle!

<span id="page-72-3"></span>God also promises to "begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven." Dread was always part of military strategy, a common boast found in Assyrian inscriptions. The defeat of the Egyptians at the crossing of the Red Sea struck fear into the hearts of the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and all of Canaan (Ex. 15:14–15). The defeat of Sihon and Og would be the same. These two kingdoms were massive compared to the other city-states in the Transjordan.

<span id="page-72-5"></span><span id="page-72-4"></span><span id="page-72-2"></span><span id="page-72-1"></span>The Transjordan is not included in the border description of the land of Canaan in Numbers 34:1–12. The northern and eastern boundaries correspond to the land of Canaan as defined by Egyptian treaties with the Hittites during the time of Rameses II. In the north, Kadesh on the Orontes remained under Hittite control. In Numbers 21:21–25 the conquest of Sihon is the result of Israel's being refused passage through his territory. In Numbers 32:1–27 the Gadites and Reubenites are granted permission to settle in the territory of Sihon on condition that they participate in the conquest of Canaan. It is not part of the territory God has given them, but it is the result of somewhat conflicted negotiations to provide pasture for the herds of those tribes. Deuteronomy, however, is explicit in declaring that

<span id="page-73-5"></span>God has given the land of Sihon to Israel. They are mandated to occupy it and settle there. Before his death Moses declared that the territory of the Transjordan was a part of the Promised Land sworn to the fathers (Deut. 34:1–4). Deuteronomy has an expanded description of the land that belongs to Israel, and it anticipates the conquest of Canaan based on the conquest that has already begun.

<span id="page-73-2"></span><span id="page-73-1"></span><span id="page-73-0"></span>2:26–30 Israel's request to Sihon to pass through his territory interrupts the narrative, which resumes with a repeat of the command to take possession of the land (Deut. 2:31). Such resumptive repetitions are common following a digression from the narrative. The procedure with Sihon has its analogy with the exodus, in which Moses asks Pharaoh for permission to leave although he already knows that Pharaoh will not let the people go (Ex. 3:16–20; 5:1–3). The hardening of Sihon's heart also corresponds to Pharaoh, who hardens his own heart, refusing to let the people go, so that God then further hardens his heart. In both cases divine action is in accordance with human disposition. Like the request to Pharaoh, the request made to Sihon betrays his attitude to Israel. Sihon would never allow Israelites access to his territory in order for them to launch an attack against Canaan. Sihon's stubborn rejection leads to his own destruction. The majesty of God can then be made evident to all as he exercises judgment against the kingdom of Sihon. This in turn leads to the dread of Israel falling on the nations.

<span id="page-73-3"></span>2:31–37 No detail is given in the battle report against Sihon, as may be found in the major battles in the book of Joshua. The conquest is given as an example of divine warfare. God orders the attack, urges courage, and promises victory; Israel obeys, the enemy is totally defeated, and Israel occupies the land. This is the model by which warfare is to be conducted in Israel.

<span id="page-73-4"></span>There are two dimensions in this warfare: invisible divine intervention and visible human action (Deut 2:32–33). At the human level, Israel encountered Sihon at Jahaz, a city in the area of Dibon according to the inscription of Mesha king of Moab.26 At one level this is normal military action, but the success of this action is dependent upon complete obedience to the divine mandate. Victory is not achievable by military ability or strategy; if God has not ordained the battle, it will end in defeat.

The treatment of Sihon's people and cities shows that his kingdom was considered part of the territory designated for conquest. They were "devoted to destruction" (Hb. *kharam*), an ancient term that has no modern equivalent.27 It is related to the term *holy* (*qadosh*), as may be seen in the matter of temple dedications in

<sup>26</sup> Breasted, *Ancient Records of Egypt*, §63, lines 19–20.

<sup>27</sup> For a discussion of lexical fields as the best way to achieve linguistic equivalency cf. Moisés Silva, *Biblical Words and Their Meaning: An Introduction to Lexical Semantics*, rev. ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1994), 161–163. He includes the three biblical Hebrew words for "separate" in his discussion: *kharam, qadosh*, and *badal*. Only *badal* can be used for spatial separation. Silva refers to the work of Angelo Vivian for his analysis. The concept of *kharam* may be seen in the inscription of Mesha king of Moab who describes his destruction of all the Israelites of Nebo because they were devoted (*kharam*) to Ashtar-Kamosh (Mesha Stele; lines 17–19). Complete dedication (extermination) of all its citizens was necessary because his god had won the battle; everything belonged to the god. For a translation of the stele cf. Andre Lemaire, "'House of David' Restored in Moabite Inscription," *BAR* 20/3 (May–June 1994): 30–37.

<span id="page-74-2"></span><span id="page-74-1"></span>Leviticus 27:14–34. If a property, for example, is dedicated to the Lord (*qadosh*), its earnings go toward the support of the temple. Such property is set apart from common use and is said to be holy because it contributes to the temple. However, the owner of such property might decide to buy it back, redeeming it (*gaʾal*) for his own use (Lev. 27:14–15). All property went back to its owner at the Year of Jubilee. If a property was not bought back at the Year of Jubilee, it would belong perpetually to the temple (Lev. 27:16–21). It was no longer merely *qadosh* but then became *kharam*. Such property belonged to the temple perpetually. It was removed from common use for all time and could never be redeemed or used for profit by anyone.

<span id="page-74-6"></span><span id="page-74-4"></span><span id="page-74-3"></span>Property dedicated in such an irrevocable manner remained in the world, but it could never be used for profane (secular) purposes. Animals so dedicated had to be killed. If a human were so dedicated, doing so would be a capital crime deserving of death (Lev. 27:29). Malachi warns of the danger that, when the Lord comes, he will claim the whole land as *kherem*, meaning that he will claim it entirely as his own domain (Mal. 4:6). This is precisely what happens in the book of Revelation, as God's judgment against earth unfolds. The conquests of Canaan are the same concept as the judgments of Revelation. At the conquest, the sins of the Amorites were complete (Gen. 15:16). There is a time at which mercy ends and all that remains is judgment. This was true in Canaan and will be true in the last judgment at the end of this age.

<span id="page-74-5"></span><span id="page-74-0"></span>It is no more appropriate to refer to the wars of conquest as genocide than it is to refer to the irrevocable gift of land as genocide. Armageddon is not a genocide. All of these are divine actions of judgment in which God irrevocably claims for himself that which is his own. The difference in the conquest is human involvement, but that does not make it different in concept. Israel can come under the judgment of *kherem* just as readily as Canaanites, as can be seen in the warnings at Jericho (Josh. 6:18). A further feature in Deuteronomy is that judgment of *kherem* is not carried out consistently in military action. All of Canaan is under *kherem* theologically, in that God is giving all the land to Israel, but actual judgment of the people is carried out only in a representative manner. The theological concept of divine judgment against all evil must be held consistently, but in practice Canaanites have opportunity to join Israel.

#### *Response*

Judgment is offensive to secular thinking. A certain kind of contemporary humanist eliminates the concept of judgment by confusing it with justice. Such linguistic confusion exacerbates the problem of vague thinking. Justice is not achieved by presuming it is possible to determine equal punishment for wrongs done. Such secular thinking in practice subverts justice. If someone steals my car and is caught, the state imposes a punishment that it deems appropriate. Such a person is said to have a "debt to society." How is it that society comes to own my car because a thief took possession of it? How is it justice when there is no obligation on the part of either the thief or law enforcers to restore my car? The situation becomes more

complex when the crime involves loss of human life. What punishment is justice for the taking of a life? Offences are deemed to be a failure of society, and such failure is addressed by a legal system of punishment. This legal system is called "justice" so that the *idea* of punishment can be avoided. This scheme is deemed to be constructive for offenders but takes no account of victims. If the state involves victims in meting out judgment, it is only to help them rationalize punishment.

<span id="page-75-0"></span>Biblical justice is expressed by the Hebrew word *mishpat*, a Hebrew term that always refers to the restoration of what is lost, plus damages. When theft takes place, justice requires restoration, including damages (e.g., Ex. 21:33–22:5). Murder cannot be resolved by justice, because life cannot be restored. The consequence of intentional plotted murder is punishment of death. This punishment, on the one hand, signals the sacredness of human life; anyone so disregarding that sanctity of life forfeits his own right to life. On the other hand, it is preventative; there could be no repetition. The conditions for conviction are stringent, almost impossible; there must be two or three witnesses. Murder is not usually carried out to facilitate witnesses. Deuteronomy provides for cities of refuge for all cases of doubt when homicide takes place. Justice and punishment operate together to show respect for life and its properties.

War is not a case of murder. In theological terms, legitimate war is God's exercise of punishment for those that have exhausted the opportunity of mercy. Such judgment is *kherem*, the removal of such persons from the world. Redemption is not possible apart from judgment. When Pharaoh enslaves Israelites, the ensuing plagues are a judgment against the Egyptians. In the end their army is submerged in the sea, and apart from such judgment there is no redemption. Entrance into the Promised Land is not a different situation. The redemption of Israel entails the judgment of those whose sins have consigned them to judgment.

Historically, human warfare never meets the ideal presented in the wars of conquest. At the same time, humans have never been able to avoid war. The instruction of Deuteronomy manifests a consistent respect for life more so than does secularism, which seeks to elevate itself above the need for punishment. Need for punishment must be acknowledged; justice must be pursued with all vigor. Humility and frank acknowledgment of the limitations of each should always be recognized.

**<sup>12</sup>** "When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities. **13**The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh.

**<sup>18</sup>** "And I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The Lord your God has given you this land to possess.

The land of Bashan was a mountain range extending north from the Yarmuk River, just south of the Sea of Galilee, to the range of Mount Herman and east to the Hauran Mountains (Jebel Druze). It is not certain if the mountains to the west and east of this range were considered part of Bashan. The Israelites did not conquer the lands of Maacah and Geshur on the western side (known as the Golan Heights in modern Israel). The land of Bashan was ruled by the Amorite King Og, remembered for his size as one of the Rephaim.

<span id="page-77-1"></span>Og, like Sihon, is not known from references outside of the Bible. Ashtaroth, one of the capitals of Og, is known from Egyptian execration texts (names of enemies were inscribed on a pot or statuette that was smashed). An Ugaritic text speaks of a god Rapha enthroned in Ashtaroth and ruling in Edrei, a text that reads remarkably like Joshua 12:4. Sihon's capital, Heshbon, is preserved in the name of Tell Hesban in Jordan, at the northern edge of the Moabite plain. The kingdoms of Sihon and Og constituted most of the territory east of the Jordan. Israelite victory over these two kings was long celebrated in Israelite memory (Pss. 135:10–12; 136:17–22). This conquered territory is described in greater or lesser detail three times in Deuteronomy 3, indicating that this takeover was very significant.

<span id="page-77-3"></span><span id="page-77-2"></span><span id="page-77-0"></span>The speeches of Moses explain that conquest and settlement were part of one process. The tribes of Reuben and Gad as well as half the tribe of Manasseh began to settle on the east side of the Jordan before the conquest of Canaan west of the Jordan. The condition of that settlement was that they support the other tribes in the conquest of their territory. Conquest and settlement were also part of the <span id="page-78-5"></span>same process on the west side of Jordan. When Joshua was an old man, much of the inheritance of Israel was not yet in its possession (Josh. 13:1). God fought for Israel in conquering main centers such as Heshbon and Ashtaroth in Transjordan and Jericho, Ai, and Hazor west of the Jordan. These were key battles allowing Israel to move into the land, but conquest continued long after that to enable the people to settle in their promised inheritance. Jerusalem was first conquered by David about two hundred years later.

<span id="page-78-2"></span><span id="page-78-1"></span><span id="page-78-0"></span>3:1–7 The conquest of Sihon was an immediate threat to the kingdom of Og, just to the north across the Jabbok. Victory over Og is described in the same schematic manner as that over Sihon. Ashtaroth and Edrei were both royal cities in the kingdom of Og (Deut. 1:4; Josh. 12:4; 13:12, 31) and are known from other ancient texts as its twin capitals. Ashtaroth is on the King's Highway in Bashan (cf. comment on 1:3–5); Edrei is to the south, on an eastern tributary of the Yarmuk. Sixty cities in the district of Argob fill an area within the region of Bashan (Josh. 13:30; 1 Kings 4:13). In Deuteronomy 3:14 Argob appears to be synonymous with the whole of Bashan, the entire territory east and north of the Sea of Galilee. The complete dedication of this territory under the *kherem* made it part of the territory claimed by God for Israel. The capture of strongly fortified cities is testimony to God's granting this territory as part of the inheritance of Israel.

<span id="page-78-4"></span><span id="page-78-3"></span>3:8–11 Transjordan territory taken from the two Amorite kings is described from south to north, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon. It includes all of the cities of the "tableland" (Hb. *mishor*) north of the Arnon, the territory taken from Moab by Sihon. The whole of Gilead was the region south and north of the Jabbok. Bashan was separated by the valley of the Yarmuk, the northernmost perennial river in the Transjordan. Its tributaries drain Bashan from the Hauran Mountains on the eastern desert. The Yarmuk empties into the Jordan just south of the Sea of Galilee; at that point the two rivers are almost the same size.

Mount Hermon is at the southern end of the Anti-Lebanon range. The three peaks of Hermon are the highest in the Levant, gathering precipitation sufficient to supply the sources of the Jordan and Litani Rivers. The names Sirion and Senir <span id="page-79-9"></span><span id="page-79-8"></span><span id="page-79-6"></span><span id="page-79-3"></span>may refer to two of the three highest peaks. According to Joshua 12:5 and 13:11 Hermon included the whole range of mountains, not just the southern slopes of Mount Hermon. Sirion is parallel to Lebanon in Psalm 29:6, making it the equivalent of the entire range rather than just one mountain. First Chronicles 5:23 distinguishes Senir from Mount Hermon, and in Ezekiel 27:5 Senir is also parallel to Lebanon. The range was known by each of these names by different peoples. Sidon, the famous port city of Phoenicia, refers to Phoenicians in general, and they called the range "Sirion." In Akkadian the entire population of Syria-Palestine was called "Amorite," and they referred to the range as "Senir."

The territory of Og in Bashan divided into four regions corresponding to its topography: Maacah was the portion north of Galilee, Geshur bordered on the Sea of Galilee north of the Yarmuk, Argob was the eastern section, and Havvoth-jair was the region south of the Yarmuk. Salecah was the easternmost city of Bashan on the southwest slopes of Mount Hauran. At least part of the Hauran is included in Bashan. Decomposed volcanoes made the soil of Bashan extremely fertile for agriculture and natural flora. It was well known for its fat cattle (cf. Ps. 22:12; Amos 4:1).

<span id="page-79-7"></span>"All Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei" is a difficult geographical designation. These two cities lie in an east-west direction in a territorial description oriented south to north. Salecah names the eastern boundary of Bashan, corresponding to the southern and northern limits given previously. Edrei was a capital of the territory along with Ashtaroth. The "cities of the kingdom of Og" is most naturally a designation of the royal (capital) cities of the kingdom. Logically the text intends to name Edrei as a capital city and Salecah as a boundary city. It is likely there has been some disruption of a text that originally said, "Bashan as far as Salecah, including Edrei and Ashtaroth, the (royal) cities of the kingdom of Og."

<span id="page-79-1"></span>Various texts preserve a memory of giant soldiers in Bashan known as sons of the Rephaim. In Ugaritic texts these are a band of divine or semidivine chariot warriors. These texts testify to an elite warrior guild whose members claimed descent from the divine or semidivine *r'pum* (cf. comment on Deut. 2:8b–12).28 These soldiers functioned under the patronage of these deities and were dedicated to their worship and service. The legacy of these giant warrior soldiers is remembered into the time of David (2 Sam. 21:15–22). "Descendants of the giants" (2 Sam. 21:16, 18) is a translation of the Hebrew *rapah*. These were the "Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim)" (Num. 13:33) encountered by the Israelites in Canaan. Ammon was considered part of the land of these Rephaim (Deut. 2:20; 3:13).

<span id="page-79-5"></span><span id="page-79-4"></span><span id="page-79-2"></span><span id="page-79-0"></span>The size of these giants is indicated by preservation of Og's "bed of iron" in Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon. "Bed" translates the Semitic word *'rs*, used figuratively for biers or tombs in Phoenician inscriptions. The iron bed probably refers to a sarcophagus, a burial chamber decorated with iron. In the time of Moses (Late Bronze Age) iron was rare and was used for ceremonial objects, jewelry, and decoration. "The common cubit" distinguishes the length from a royal cubit, a special

<sup>28</sup> Margulis, "Ugaritic Psalm (RŠ 24.252)," 292–304.

measurement known in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The sarcophagus measured approximately 13.5 feet (4 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m). Though it would have been larger than Og, its size is indicative of this warrior-king's renown as one of the Rephaim.

<span id="page-80-3"></span><span id="page-80-2"></span>3:12–17 Moses goes on to describe the apportionment of the land among two and a half of the tribes. A summary describes the allotment from south to north, the order in which it was conquered (vv. 12–13). Reuben and Gad received the territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok. Half of the tribe of Manasseh received the territory north of the Jabbok to Mount Hermon (1 Chron. 5:23). Numbers 32:1–4 tells of the request of these tribes for this territory to support their vast numbers of livestock.

<span id="page-80-4"></span><span id="page-80-1"></span><span id="page-80-0"></span>These allotments of Manasseh are divided between the descendants of Jair and those of Machir, grandsons of Joseph. The territory of Jair extended west to the areas of Geshur and Maacah, which border the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan, respectively. Jair apparently conquered specific sites in Argob following the national conquest (v. 14). "Havvoth-jair" refers to the villages (Hb. *ḥawwot*) of Jair. If these are the sixty cities captured from Og, they are not literally villages, for these were all well fortified (vv. 4–5). In Solomon's administration the sixty cities are separate from Havvoth-jair (1 Kings 4:13), and in the genealogies Jair is given twenty-three cities in Gilead (1 Chron. 2:22). In the time of the judges the sons of Jair rule over thirty cities (Judg. 10:3–5). It is likely that the territory ranged in size over time and included cities in Gilead as well as Bashan. The descendants of Machir occupied the territory north of the Jabbok.

<span id="page-80-11"></span><span id="page-80-10"></span><span id="page-80-8"></span><span id="page-80-5"></span>Reuben and Gilead occupied the territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok. Deuteronomy 3:17 describes the western border of these two tribes. Although their territory was limited to the Jabbok in the east, it extended all the way to the Sea of Galilee, beyond the Yarmuk, in the west. The territory of Machir, like the territory of Og before him, did not extend as far west as the Jordan.

<span id="page-80-6"></span>3:18–22 "Men of valor shall cross over armed" in advance of the main army. The distinction of these elite troops can only be inferred. The Hebrew word *khalats* ("armed") has several metaphorical uses that begin from the sense of being separated or withdrawn. Such troops may be the vanguard of the army, the advance contingents preparing the army for battle.

<span id="page-80-13"></span><span id="page-80-12"></span><span id="page-80-9"></span><span id="page-80-7"></span>"Until the Lord gives rest" is a theological phrase used for the fulfillment of the divine promises and the entering of redemption. It is used repeatedly of coming into the Promised Land (Josh. 1:12–15; 21:43–45; 23:1), which finds its continuation when David conquers his enemies, giving rest to Israel in establishing the kingdom (2 Sam. 7:1, 11). Those that died in the wilderness did not enter that rest, as expressed in Psalm 95:6–11. This psalm is developed extensively in Hebrews 3:7–4:13, urging believers to enter the rest of redemption that has been provided in Christ Jesus. With the conquest of the Transjordan, the promises to the patriarchs leading to redemption had begun to be experienced. This conquest is also an assurance to Joshua that God will fight for Israel to give them this rest as they cross the Jordan.

<span id="page-81-5"></span>3:23–25 God had allowed Moses to lead the conquest of the Transjordan. This encouraged Moses to hope that he might at least symbolically accomplish the goal of his life, thwarted first by his killing of the Egyptian and then again by the rebellion at Kadesh-barnea. This prayer follows the typical form of petitions. He pleads to be allowed to cross the Jordan on the grounds that the conquest has already begun. "Let me go over" is expressed by the verb *ʿabar*, used repeatedly to describe the whole process of journeying to the Transjordan and conquering the territory (Deut. 2:4, 8, 13, 14, 18, 24, 27, 28, 29; 3:18, 21). Moses is requesting just one more passing, this time into Canaan west of the Jordan, as the completion of his life's work before he crosses the Jordan of his life's end.

<span id="page-81-7"></span><span id="page-81-4"></span><span id="page-81-3"></span><span id="page-81-2"></span>3:26–29 God's response is given with a homonym of *ʿabar*, this time with the meaning of anger. "Enough from you" is the same phrase found in the command to leave Horeb: "You have stayed long enough at this mountain" (1:6). Moses had urged the people to "go up" and "take possession" (1:21). God has the same instruction for Moses, but it is limited to a consolation: "Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes." Moses will complete his life journey by seeing the land he longed to enter.

The abrupt end of the dialogue indicates that Moses was silent before God. Moses would journey no further than Beth-peor, a wadi in Moab running into the Jordan on the northeast corner of the Dead Sea. The next crossing would be made by Joshua, who had earlier been commissioned to take over the role of Moses.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-81-9"></span><span id="page-81-8"></span><span id="page-81-1"></span>Settlement of the Transjordan brings to a conclusion the saga of the life of Moses. It is a story of 120 years (Deut. 34:7), most of it lived in the wilderness. According to Stephen, Moses was forty years old when he intervened in Egypt, seeking to deliver the Israelites (Acts 7:23). This is likely a calculation based on the note that Moses was eighty years old when he returned to Egypt (Ex. 7:7). The life of Moses is divided into three periods, each of which involves some form of alienation. It begins in the Egyptian court in the care of Pharaoh's daughter. Moses' attempt to intervene on behalf of those he knows to be his people results in exile in Midian. While Moses is shepherding near Sinai, God appears to him in a fiery theophany and commissions him to lead Israel out of Egypt (Ex. 3:1–12). Moses returns to Sinai with the Israelites, as God makes a covenant with them.

<span id="page-81-6"></span><span id="page-81-0"></span>After a two-year stay they arrive at Kadesh-barnea, but the rebellion there results in thirty-eight years in the Wilderness of Paran. With this background, one can appreciate the prayer of Moses in Deuteronomy 3:23–25. It would be a symbolic achievement just to step across the river, but this was not to be. The life goal of Moses is reduced to eighty years of wilderness wandering. During much of this time Moses must have concluded that his life work would end in ignominy. This was not merely his own shortcoming; it had to do with his association with this rebellious people (v. 26). His sacrifice on their behalf did not result in success during his lifetime.

<span id="page-82-8"></span><span id="page-82-6"></span><span id="page-82-5"></span><span id="page-82-2"></span>Psalm 90 is marked as a prayer of Moses. It is the only psalm associated with Moses, but its strategic place in the psalter indicates that the Mosaic promise became very significant in later times. Psalm 90 begins the fourth division of the psalter, following a psalm that laments the failure of Israel and concludes with a plea for deliverance. The failure of the Davidic kings leads to a focus on Moses and the Promised Land. The fourth section of the psalter ends with Psalms 105–106, which recall the exodus and the failure of Israel. Within this section Psalms 93–100 focus on the rule of God as King, Judge, and Savior. The fourth division is further characterized by remembering the mercy shown to Moses (Psalm 103) and the beauty of creation ruled by God (Psalm 104). Psalm 90 is a fitting description of the life of Moses, as it begins with a lament of the fleeting nature of human life, no matter how many years a person may live. The experience of human life is toil, and it is lived under judgment that is the consequence of human failure. The lament ends in a prayer for mercy (Ps. 90:14–15) and asks that the reward of toil may be equal to the suffering endured. The prayer is that the labor of human life may somehow come to be a part of the work of God (Ps. 90:16–17), even when it is not evident how this could be the result.

<span id="page-82-7"></span><span id="page-82-4"></span><span id="page-82-3"></span><span id="page-82-1"></span>The life of Moses is exemplary as the fulfillment of this prayer. Moses dies never having experienced the rest he worked for, that which he sacrificed his life to achieve. Yet his eighty years in the wilderness result in his being remembered as the prophet of Israel, probably influenced by the promise that God would provide an order of prophets for Israel like Moses (Deut. 18:15). At the time of his death at Mount Nebo, Moses could not have known what would become of his life sacrifice. He died in faith, knowing that God would fulfill his promise but also knowing that the covenant he enjoined on Israel would be broken, that they would ultimately experience the judgment of exile. Moses could not know that this Torah he left them would become the foundation of revelation that would endure even after Israel rejected its teaching. God indeed took the work of his hands and established it as part of the work of an eternal kingdom.

### *Section Overview: Wisdom of Israel; Remembering Horeb; Warning against Idolatry*

<span id="page-83-1"></span><span id="page-83-0"></span>Deuteronomy 4:1–40 is the second division of the first address of Moses. The phrase "And now, O Israel" at the beginning of this address suggests it is a continuation of the preceding one. A similar example can be found at Deuteronomy 10:12, which continues the Sinai exhortation. Having described how Israel reached the border of the Promised Land, Moses now addresses the people's future life in the land. In the first part of the speech, successful entry into the land depended on obedience to God's orders. Once in the land, the future well-being of the people will depend on their obedience to the "statutes and rules" Moses is teaching them.

<span id="page-84-10"></span><span id="page-84-9"></span><span id="page-84-0"></span>The second part of the first address is a sermon. Chapter 4 is a précis of chapters 5–11, which contain the prologue of the second address. Together chapters 4 and 5–11 present the historical experiences that establish the validity of "the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules" the Israelites received when they left Egypt (Deut. 4:45). They stress the exclusive worship of Yahweh, which is the foundation of all other requirements. Chapter 4 explains the reasons for this duty. Chapter 5 validates the role of Moses in receiving the Torah and establishes its authenticity. In chapters 6–11 Moses begins to carry out his role by urging the general duties of love and reverence for God.

<span id="page-84-11"></span><span id="page-84-8"></span><span id="page-84-4"></span><span id="page-84-3"></span>Chapter 4 begins with two questions that emphasize the unique character of Israel: "What great nation is there that has a god so near?" (v. 7); "What great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law?" (v. 8). Two questions at the end of the chapter emphasize the unique character of the God of Israel: "Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire?" (v. 33); "Has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation?" (v. 34). The first two questions in verses 1–8 summarize the prologue, and the second two questions in verses 32–40 summarize the epilogue of the sermon. The main topic of the central portion is the warning against the worship of idols and a notice of its consequences.

<span id="page-84-7"></span><span id="page-84-6"></span><span id="page-84-5"></span><span id="page-84-2"></span><span id="page-84-1"></span>The danger of neglecting the words of the covenant is repeated with the Hebrew verb *shamar* ("keep," "observe"). Moses teaches the people statutes and rules: "keep them" (v. 6); "take care" and "keep your soul diligently, lest you forget" (v. 9); "watch yourselves very carefully" (v. 15); "take care, lest you forget" (v. 23). Moses anticipates the declaration of Isaiah that humanity is "grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field. . . . The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever" (Isa. 40:6–8). The former generation perished in the wilderness because they forgot their covenant vow at Mount Sinai. In his final address Moses warns the people that they will not live long in the land if they neglect the vow they are about to take as they enter it.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-85-4"></span><span id="page-85-3"></span><span id="page-85-2"></span><span id="page-85-0"></span>4:1–4 The fundamental responsibility of the people of the covenant is to listen to the rules and regulations that guide their relationships with each other and with God. The great confession of Israel is simply called the Shema, the Hebrew word for *listen* (Deut. 6:4–5). It is Moses' responsibility to teach the people how to live according to these rules and regulations. This is the first time this word for "teach" (Hb. *lamad*) occurs in the Pentateuch, but the whole work of Moses is to teach. The word *torah* ("law"; 4:8) and a word for "teach" derive from the root word *yarah*. God calls Moses up the mountain to receive the Torah written on tablets of stone in order to teach them (*lehorotam*) to the people (Ex. 24:12). The Torah is instruction concerning how to live. Such instruction must be applied to a great variety of situations through rules (*huqqim*), regulations (*mishpatim*), commandments (*mitsvot*), and stipulations (*ʿedot*). These four terms are basically synonymous, with very little distinction in meaning. The "statutes and the rules" of the first verse translate *huqqim* and *mishpatim*, respectively. The first word designates a written rule in general use; the second is the consequence of a decision made by a judge or an officer, a regulation that has been determined. These are practices of daily life that must be learned.

<span id="page-85-7"></span><span id="page-85-6"></span>The command not to add or take away anything from Moses' instruction conveys the sense of divine authority found in these words. Jeremiah 26:2 similarly warns against failing to speak a word of prophecy from God. Analogous sentiments may be found in wisdom literature (Prov. 30:5–6; Eccles. 3:14; 12:11–12). The rules and regulations taught by Moses are instruction with exclusive authority that could be used by later prophets and wisdom teachers to make known God's will in circumstances long after Moses. No authority could add to this instruction or deny any part of it.

<span id="page-85-1"></span>The plague at Baal-peor was proof of the dangers of idolatry, the fundamental violation of all the teaching of Moses. While Israel was encamped at Abel-shittim (lit., "in the acacias [thorny shrubs]") near the Jordan west of Heshbon, they had their first encounter with the Baal gods of Canaan (Num. 25:1–9). These gods were worshiped in an attempt to provide rain for crops and fecundity for herds. The gods of Canaan became especially prominent around the time of Moses. Israel was unprepared to confront Baal, and the consequences were disastrous. Many Israelites, including a prominent chieftain, were seduced by Moabite women into engaging in their worship. The plague was stopped by the actions of Phinehas, a priest responsible for protecting the sanctuary. His impassioned actions ended in the slaying of two prominent perpetrators violating the very area of the sanctuary. This intervention served to ransom the rest of the people and terminate the plague (Ps. 106:28–31). The sin of Baal-peor was etched in the collective memory of Israel as a low point in its history.

<span id="page-85-5"></span>Those who remained loyal to the covenant at Baal-peor were present to hear the teaching of Moses that emphasized that life in the land was dependent entirely on the Israelites' relationship with God. Those who "held fast" to the covenant displayed the emotional attachment and loyalty that would enable them to resist the allures of idolatry that lead to death. Moses' speech concludes with the same admonition concerning the choice of life and death: choose life "by loving the Lord your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules" (Deut. 30:16). To love the Lord is to hold fast to the covenant stipulations.

<span id="page-86-4"></span><span id="page-86-1"></span><span id="page-86-0"></span>4:5–8 God charged Moses with teaching Israel the rules and regulations he received at Mount Sinai. The importance of this teaching is emphasized with the double imperative to "keep them and do them" (v. 6). Obedience to these commands is wisdom for Israel, a covenant life meant to distinguish Israel from all other nations. One such distinction is that their God is near them and immediately responsive to their prayers. Other nations lived largely in fear since they believed they needed to appease their gods and because the limited power of their gods could not assure their safety. A second distinction is the quality of life the covenant regulations provide for Israel. These rules are just; they are the guidance Israel needs to live in peace. Even a cursory comparison of the regulations of Moses with the famous law code of Hammurabi makes evident the distinction of justice as conceived in Israel compared with her neighbors. Prohibition of capital punishment for economic offenses, prohibition of vicarious punishment, and provision for slaves and orphans are some of the obvious differences.

<span id="page-86-5"></span><span id="page-86-3"></span>4:9–14 The visual experience of the majesty of the Lord inspired fear in those who witnessed the dense, dark cloud and the blazing fire and heard the thunder of God's voice on the mountain. Such majesty would be remembered in Israel, as expressed in the prayer of David in 2 Samuel 22:8–16. Such a visual encounter is a fearful experience that cannot be forgotten. Such memory, however, does not necessarily transfer to living in the fear of the Lord, and knowing how to fear the Lord as instructed in Deuteronomy is forgotten all too readily. The exhortation is urgent: "Keep your soul diligently, lest you forget" (Deut. 4:9). Fear of the Lord is the means for removing all other fears, and it is the reason the instruction of the Ten Words must be diligently observed.

<span id="page-86-2"></span>Moses reminds the people that the purpose of the theophany at Horeb was to impart the Ten Words of the covenant, written on the two stone tablets (the Decalogue). Though these have come to be known as commandments, the Hebrew consistently calls them *ʿaseret debarim* ("Ten Words"). These words are of an order wholly different than all other commandments. The Ten Words lay the foundation of the covenant values to be preserved in relationship with God and all other people, irrespective of circumstance. The fundamental charge of the covenant is loyalty to God, which engenders sanctity of life, inviolability of family, and integrity within community. These values must be applied to a variety of circumstances; it is these applications that become commandments and rules for individual cases. Living according to the Torah requires careful analysis of each situation. The teaching revealed to Moses in Exodus provides a variety of examples of such

<span id="page-87-2"></span><span id="page-87-1"></span>judicial regulations applied to circumstantial analysis (Ex. 21:1). Exodus 21:12, for example, states that the penalty for homicide is death. If a death happens accidentally, the killer is not culpable; cities of refuge are provided for safety. However, if a plot to kill is carried out, not even the altar can provide a place of safety (Ex. 21:13–14). A judge's interpretation in such situations becomes an example of the rules and regulations (*mishpatim*) to be followed, demonstrating that adherence to the covenant includes all the practical matters of everyday life.

<span id="page-87-3"></span>4:15–20 Moses further develops the implications of the appearance of God at Sinai. Since Israel saw no visible form when God spoke, they are not to make idols in any form. A "carved image" (Hb. *pesel*) is used only for images of a god that may be made of wood, metal, or stone. Israel is not to make an idol in the form (shape) of anything or a statue (*semel*) that may be in the likeness of a man or woman. The idols of ancient deities were often in the form of a human male or female. The context does not refer to other gods, so the prohibition must be specifically against images made to represent Yahweh. The purpose of idols was to mediate the deity's presence to receive their blessing or their message. Since the Lord had spoken to Israel directly, without the mediation of any such idol, they were not to have anything other than an earthen altar made of unsculpted stones (Ex. 20:22–26). A statue assumes that representation of a god somehow attracts the presence of that god. The revelation at Mount Sinai had made it evident that no such contact was possible with the God of the covenant.

<span id="page-87-0"></span>The prohibition against representation in any form extends to the likeness of any creature on land or in rivers, lakes, or sky. This is probably an extension of the definition of idol. Any statue or image intended as an idol is forbidden. It does not rule out the possibility of other statues or images that have no function as an idol. The bulls supporting the giant water tank in Solomon's temple or the cherubs in the Most Holy Place were acceptable because they did not serve an idolatrous purpose. Animal images could serve to represent a god in the absence of a statue. The calf is depicted as the pedestal on which Baal stood, but the calf is also found independently as an idol of Baal.

<span id="page-87-5"></span>Worship of the heavenly bodies is also forbidden. Sun, moon, and stars are worshiped as gods by other nations. For Israel sun, stars, lightning, thunder, wind, spirits, angels, and all such powers are recognized to be God's agents, carrying out his purpose, but they are never worthy of worship (Ps. 89:6–7). The host of heaven is God's royal court, the divine council. Idols or foreign gods of the nations are impotent statues or spirits, not actual gods (Deut. 4:28). In exile Israel will be led to the worship of impotent images; the impotence of the image is proof of the powerlessness of the gods they represent.

<span id="page-87-4"></span>Syncretism is a very subtle form of idolatry. The Israelites could easily be "drawn away" from exclusive worship of the Lord through the polytheism of other nations. The celestial bodies' majestic position, their movements, their light and warmth, their necessity for agriculture, and their power for life always makes them potential <span id="page-88-4"></span>objects of worship. Israel could be drawn into this worship and believe that they were not denying their allegiance to Yahweh made in the oath of the covenant. Job is acutely aware of this seduction (Job 31:26–28). Only nations outside this covenant could have such powers as deities to worship. Israel has been set free from subservience to such deities.

<span id="page-88-3"></span><span id="page-88-1"></span>4:21–22 The death of Moses in Transjordan is a judgment that has implications for the future of the people entering the Promised Land. Once he is no longer present to teach or warn them, they may forget the covenant and worship idols (Deut. 31:16–22). Worship of foreign gods will cause them to be exiled from the land they are about to enter.

#### *Response*

Nothing is more important to faith than an understanding of God as the sole object of our trust. If Israel perceives God correctly, they will fear him and love him. This is much more than monotheism, a belief in one God. Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten), about the time of the exodus, became a devotee of the solar disk, the Aten, establishing a cult that closed other temples and destroyed their images. But one god represented in one of the elements of creation is simple idolatry. Moses reminds Israel that their God cannot be discerned by the human mind. The fatal error of modernism, initiated by what was called the Enlightenment and perpetuated in postmodernism, is to assume there is no knowledge beyond what the senses through the mind can discern. This is a fatal, idolatrous religion. It is another way of worshiping creation, commonly expressed in the power of "mother earth."

<span id="page-88-0"></span>The God of Israel can be known only through the word he speaks to reveal himself. Since personal knowledge of God is exclusive to his word, it is critical that there be no additions or omissions to it (Deut. 4:2). This warning of Moses is not defining "canon" as discussed in theology, a defined set of inspired writings that reveal the whole counsel of God. Moses is simply speaking about the authority of revelation to make clear that knowledge of God in a personal relationship is possible only through the prophetic word. This word must not be distorted by speculative additions or its force limited through omissions. This word enables the people of the covenant to know God truly. Revelation has made clear that God cannot be known *fully* (vv. 35, 39). But if God is understood *truly*, it becomes evident that there can be no other God, for the God of Israel encompasses all reality. He revealed himself apart from any form in the power of darkness and fire. His holiness means he is separate from all creation and that therefore nothing in creation can be used to represent him. And because Yahweh is responsible for all creation, it is folly not to place complete faith in him, to love and fear him in every circumstance.

<span id="page-88-2"></span>It is important to know the distinguished responsibility given to those who have received the revelation of God. Israel is not the same as other nations because of this unique encounter with God. The grandeur of creation is given by God as <span id="page-89-3"></span><span id="page-89-2"></span><span id="page-89-0"></span>revelation to the other nations (v. 19). This is significant for them, but it is fatal for Israel to reduce its knowledge of God to the powers of the heavenly bodies, as might be done by an Egyptian pharaoh. God has shown Israel his great love in delivering them from the iron furnace (v. 20), in giving them regulations for life (vv. 6–8), in being near them so that they can call upon him immediately at any time. Israel must enable the nations to know this God so that they too may see true wisdom and true security. Any use of an idol to represent God necessarily distorts the God who can be known only through revelation. God is represented by Israel to the other nations, for they are the ones who bear the knowledge of his Word.

<span id="page-89-4"></span><span id="page-89-1"></span>The sacredness of faith in this incomparable God and the danger of compromise are evident in the life of Moses. Moses will not enter the Land of Promise because of the words of the people (v. 21). These are the words of faithlessness, their failure to trust God in the critical moment. Moses must die with that generation, never experiencing the Land of Promise. The warning is stern (v. 9): watch yourselves and protect your lives very carefully, lest you forget what you have seen.

### <span id="page-89-5"></span>DEUTERONOMY 4:23–43

**<sup>23</sup>**Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make a carved image, the form of anything that the Lord your God has forbidden you. **24**For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.

**<sup>25</sup>** "When you father children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, so as to provoke him to anger, **<sup>26</sup>** I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long in it, but will be utterly destroyed. **27**And the Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the Lord will drive you. **28**And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of human hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. **29**But from there you will seek the Lord your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. **30**When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the Lord your God and obey his voice. **31**For the Lord your God is a merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them.

**<sup>32</sup>** "For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of. **33**Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? **34**Or

### *Section Overview: Exile and Restoration; Election and Revelation; Cities of Refuge*

<span id="page-90-6"></span><span id="page-90-2"></span><span id="page-90-1"></span>This chapter holds notable parallels with the last speech of Moses; both contain warnings against idolatry and a description of its dire consequences. Deuteronomy 30:17–19 may be verbally compared with 4:25–26: God summons heavens and earth as witnesses against the disobedience of Israel, that they will quickly perish from the land. When they are scattered among the nations, they will seek God with all their heart; when they turn to God, he will have compassion on them and gather them into the land their fathers inherited (4:27–31; 30:1–10). Exile, repentance, and renewal of divine grace are formulated in almost identical terms. The whole book of Deuteronomy is considered a witness against Israel because of the danger of disobedience (31:24–26). Deuteronomy 31:16–26 forms an envelope with 4:23–40. Both passages anticipate the exile but provide assurance of the faithfulness and mercy of God in restoring his people. Just as Moses anticipated the exile, he foresaw the restoration, which will be realized when the people repent.

<span id="page-90-7"></span><span id="page-90-5"></span><span id="page-90-4"></span><span id="page-90-0"></span>The Hebrew text traditions separate the designation of the cities of refuge in Deuteronomy 4:41–43 from the speech of Moses. The last line of verse 40 is left open, indicating a major break ( *parashah petuhah*) before a new topic follows. The chapter divisions indicate that all of verses 41–49 are supplementary to the sermon. Chapter divisions were a relatively late Christian addition by Stephen Langton <span id="page-91-5"></span>of Canterbury while lecturing in Paris (c. AD 1204–1205). They were probably based on earlier divisions attributed to Archbishop Lanfranc. These divisions were transferred into the Hebrew from the Latin. All systems of division are subjective, and the divisions are not consistent. The introduction to the second speech logically begins with the Torah that Moses set before the people of Israel (4:44). The content of the second speech consists of the Ten Words of the covenant followed by explanatory rules, regulations, commandments, and stipulations.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-91-3"></span>4:23–24 The words "Take care, lest you forget" are the final occurrence of this command in the chapter. The forgetting of the covenant is not a cognitive problem of memory but a failure to maintain the commitment that was made. Married people remember their wedding and that they have taken a vow. What they sometimes forget, not cognitively but in many failures and compromises, is the commitment made to each other in those vows. Israel was in danger of making a "carved image" (idol) of any shape, neglecting exclusive commitment in the covenant with Yahweh.

<span id="page-91-1"></span>Israel could not forget that her God was a consuming fire. Once, when the sons of Aaron Nadab and Abihu offered incense on the golden altar other than that prescribed in the morning and evening, they were consumed by fire (Lev. 10:1–2). On another occasion the people complained about their living conditions in the wilderness, possibly the forced marches, and the fire of Yahweh burned in the camp (Num. 11:1). These are dramatic examples, but another generation might become oblivious to its own violations of the covenant, which would drive the people away from the land they were about to enter.

<span id="page-91-4"></span><span id="page-91-2"></span><span id="page-91-0"></span>4:25–31 Life in the Promised Land was always conditional on Israel's obedience, even though the covenant God made with the patriarchs was not conditional. Further, the character of God is fundamentally that of mercy, as emphasized in the significance of the divine name (Ex. 33:19; 34:5–7; Ps. 103:7–8; Jonah 4:1–2). Disobedience is never without consequences, but within the providence of God a remnant of Israel would remain. Though their number be few, the faithful would cry out for the mercy of God. Unlike Israel, God would not "forget the covenant" he had made with their fathers.

<span id="page-92-3"></span>4:32–40 The presence of Israel at the Jordan River is evidence of the uniqueness of Israel among the nations, but more importantly it is a continuing testimony to the incomparable God who has brought them there. What other God would "take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm?" No other nation had a god devoted exclusively to its redemption and destined to fulfill the purposes of the covenant he had with his people. This passage emphasizes that the idols and gods of the other nations, whatever they may be, are undeserving of being called "God." The gods of the nations are powerless idols that can "neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell" (Deut. 4:28; cf. Ps. 96:4–5). Israel has encountered the living God; this God made them hear his voice from heaven and showed them his great fire on earth (Deut. 4:36). He is "God in heaven above" and "on the earth beneath; there is no other" (v. 39); indeed, there can be no other.

<span id="page-92-8"></span><span id="page-92-7"></span><span id="page-92-6"></span><span id="page-92-4"></span><span id="page-92-1"></span><span id="page-92-0"></span>4:41–43 Cities of refuge were a place of safety for someone guilty of manslaughter. There were six cities in total, three on each side of the Jordan. The law establishing these cities is found in Numbers 35:9–34; Deuteronomy 19:1–13. The appointment of all six cites is found in Joshua 20:7–8. The description in Joshua is plural: "they set apart" the cities named, indicating that Joshua and Moses each had a part in designating the cities of refuge.

The time at which Moses designated the three cities of the Transjordan is ambiguous. Moses led the forces of Israel in conquest of the Transjordan and enabled three tribes to settle there, making his appointment of these three cities necessary. The record of this appointment was added by the narrator between the sermons of Moses so that they would not cause interruption. The incorporation of this record within the narrative may relate to the repeated statement that Moses will not enter the land. The exclusion of Moses from Israel's future does not preclude his engaging in their settlement of the Promised Land.

The cities of refuge are also Levitical cities. It may be that the Levites have responsibility for their administration. Each territory has one city. Bezer is located on the tableland north of the Arnon. Ramoth is in Gilead in the region of Argob, the eastern area of Bashan. Golan is found in the western part of northern Transjordan nearer the Sea of Galilee. It comes to identify the whole region of Geshur.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-92-5"></span><span id="page-92-2"></span>Moses concludes with a final warning concerning the obligation of the covenant. The presence of the covenant must carry with it a continual fear of being unfaithful. God is a consuming fire, as Israel has experienced on several occasions. If Israel learns to fear God, she will fear nothing else. God will never forget her; nor can he be unfaithful to his promise (Deut. 4:31–35). Never has there been a redemption like that of Israel, not from the beginning of humanity in any place from one end of heaven to the other. Never has there been this kind of revelation (vv. 36–39). God has demonstrated his love consistently. There can be no fear before God whose mercy endures forever and whose power has no limit. If love for God fails, all that can remain is fear of wrath as a consuming fire.

<span id="page-93-3"></span><span id="page-93-2"></span><span id="page-93-1"></span>The new covenant is openly declared by the Lord Jesus at the Last Supper (Luke 22:20). In baptism, the believer publicly confesses allegiance to the new covenant, just as Israel does upon its entrance into the Promised Land. This covenant is affirmed each time believers partake of the Lord's Table. Failure to observe this confession must evoke the greatest of fear. What must be the consequence for one that tramples underfoot the blood of the new covenant and causes outrage to "the Spirit of grace" (Heb. 10:29)? "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:31). There can be no fear for the person secure in the grace of the one who shed his blood for the forgiveness of sins in the new covenant. There must be great fear of denying that covenant vow declared publicly in baptism.

### <span id="page-93-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 4:44–5:21

**<sup>44</sup>**This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel. **45**These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules, which Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt, **46**beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the people of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt. **47**And they took possession of his land and the land of Og, the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan; **<sup>48</sup>** from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion*<sup>1</sup>* (that is, Hermon), **<sup>49</sup>** together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.

5 And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them. **2**The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. **3**Not with our fathers did the Lord make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today. **4**The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire, **5**while I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord.

#### *Section Overview: Superscription; Covenant at Horeb; Decalogue*

<span id="page-94-3"></span><span id="page-94-2"></span><span id="page-94-1"></span>The second address of Moses begins with a superscription followed by a prologue, as in the first speech. The superscription in Deuteronomy 4:44–49 essentially repeats that of 1:1–5. The second superscription takes up the topic introduced in the first speech; it provides the place and time when "Moses undertook to explain this law" (1:5). The exposition of "this law" was delayed by a lengthy historical review, which recounted how Israel came to be camped in the valley opposite Bethpeor. The second superscription resumes the subject that constitutes the substance of the book of Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-94-0"></span>The prologue of this law begins with the words of the covenant the people made at Horeb. These are the words received at Mount Sinai as recounted in Exodus 20:1–17. This is not simply a repetition of the words in Exodus, as is obvious in the obligation of Sabbath observance and the prohibition against coveting. The covenant words are not rules established for specific cases (Hb. *mishpatim*) or other commandments (*mitzvot*) with a specificity that enables legislative power. "You shall not covet" is not a rule that can be coerced. These statements of the covenant relationship are given in the second-person singular, indicating that they apply equally to every individual of Israelite society throughout time. These words <span id="page-95-9"></span>of the covenant are formulated as prohibitions. Only the Sabbath regulation and the requirement to honor parents are stated positively, but they are also essentially prohibitive. The instruction of the Sabbath is that on the seventh day work must not be done (Deut. 5:14); keeping the Sabbath holy is a proscription against work on that day. The importance of honoring parents is exemplified in the penalty of death prescribed for physical or verbal abuse (Ex. 21:15, 17). Honor for parents begins with precluding anything that would bring dishonor.

<span id="page-95-8"></span><span id="page-95-2"></span><span id="page-95-1"></span><span id="page-95-0"></span>None of these prohibitions has legislative value without further qualification. The case of the goring bull in Exodus 21:28–32 is an example of the ambiguities concerning murder. Adultery has similar ambiguities (Ex. 22:16–17; Lev. 19:20– 22). The prohibitions of these words protect the values regarded as essential to life in the covenant community. Fundamental requirements are the fear of the Lord and protection of the family. These are delineated specifically in terms of the sacredness of the covenant oath and the honor of parents (Deut. 5:11, 16). The community must protect the sanctity of life, marriage, property, and truth. Even a desire leading to violation of these essential values is prohibited. If these values are guarded by each member of the community, a life of peace will be possible. In this respect the words given at Sinai and repeated here by Moses have the same impact in both occasions.

The phrase "this is the law" identifies a document referred to eighteen times in the book of Deuteronomy. The first superscription introduces the topic of the book: "Moses undertook to explain this law" (Deut. 1:5). This law was a document the king needed to keep at his side (17:18–20); it was to be read to all the people at the end of every seven years, in the year of release of debt, during the Feast of Tabernacles (31:9–13). This law was on a scroll written by Moses, entrusted to the priests and kept with the ark (30:10; 31:24, 26). The original scroll must have contained the second address of Moses introduced in this superscription (4:44). The contents named in the superscription apply generally to the entire address from 5:1 to 26:19. Deuteronomy 4:44–45 provides a broad outline of the second address. The Torah of verse 44 consists of the hortatory instructions in chapters 5–11 and the stipulations, rules, and regulations Moses gives Israel in chapters 12–26. The second section is sometimes called the Deuteronomic Code.

<span id="page-96-9"></span><span id="page-96-5"></span><span id="page-96-4"></span><span id="page-96-1"></span>5:1–5 "The statutes and the rules," which Moses speaks in the hearing of the people, is a word pair occurring fourteen times in Deuteronomy. It describes the substance of the hortatory address (4:1, 5, 8, 14). In the second address of Moses these words frame the two main units of the speech: the prologue in 5:1; 11:32 and the Deuteronomic Code in 12:1; 26:16. Although these terms are complemented with "testimonies" in the superscription of 4:45, the two are joined consistently as a phrase in marking the beginning and end of the main sections of the book of this law in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-96-3"></span>The events that took place at Mount Sinai instituted a covenant between the Lord and the people Moses is addressing in the valley facing Beth-peor. Moses' authority in mediating this covenant and the distinct nature of the rules and regulations governing the covenant relationship needed to be established. The voice of God in the ears of the people was critical in establishing both points. Moses reminds these people that his appointment as intermediary was at their request; they feared a continuing encounter with God. Although the people heard the voice of God, the actual content of the words was relayed by Moses, as clarified in verse 5. This is consistent with the depiction of the scene at Mount Sinai in Exodus 19:9, 19. The people had promised to obey all of the instructions revealed on the mountain.

<span id="page-96-0"></span>The rules, regulations, and commandments that Moses teaches Israel have their source and sanction in the God of the covenant. This point is important, because they are unlike any other law code. In Mesopotamia, the home of the fathers of Israel, the law was conceived of as the embodiment of cosmic truths (Hb. *kinatum*; sing. *kittum*). Shamash, the god of justice, was merely the custodian of these laws. The ideal of the law was above both gods and humans. However, the actual author of the laws embodying the cosmic ideal was the king. The laws were his, and the stele on which they were inscribed was called by his name. In the world around Israel, the king was the authority behind the written law. Deuteronomy shows a marked contrast to this in its insistence that the king must keep at his side a copy of the divine law, because both he and the people are subject to it. Moses as the intermediary teaches the law, but his authority is limited to that role.

<span id="page-96-8"></span><span id="page-96-7"></span><span id="page-96-6"></span><span id="page-96-2"></span>5:6–10 The words of the covenant written on stone and given to Moses are counted as ten (Deut. 4:13; 10:4), but there is no original indication as to how the actual text of the Decalogue is to be divided into this number. The Masoretic Text, which serves as the basis of the ESV, indicates the separation of each of the Ten Words by a short space within the text called a *setumah*. These divisions make verses 6–10 the first word. The Masoretic Text further makes a separation between coveting the wife of another man and coveting anything of his property or servants in 5:21. However, this is not the only division of the Ten Words. Verse 6 appears to be an introduction to the Ten Words as well as to the first word, which prohibits any other gods besides Yahweh. The church fathers united verses 6–7, separating "You shall have no other gods" from the making of idols. This is also indicated by

a vocalization within the Masoretic Text. Augustine, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Lutherans regard the injunction to have no other gods and not to make any idols as one word. They then separate "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife" from "You shall not desire your neighbor's house" or any of his other property. This is the division of the Masoretic Text. This commentary will follow the church fathers in the enumeration of the Ten Words, which is the Reformed tradition.

<span id="page-97-2"></span><span id="page-97-1"></span>Verses 6–10 are a conceptual unity that is not affected by the different ways in which they have been divided. Nothing can be more fundamental for faith and life than understanding Yahweh, the Lord of the covenant. Theses verses are, in effect, a monotheistic statement, though they do not explicitly deny the existence of other gods, as expressed in 4:35–39. Other powers could be referred to as "gods," but their existence is of no relevance when the person of God is known to be the Creator, who holds absolute domain over his earth and has extended his redemption to the people who have entered the covenant. Fear of any other power is a rejection of the fear of the Lord. Knowing the sovereign power of God should engender fear, and the redemption of God should provoke love. The fundamental requirement, therefore, is for the people of the covenant to fear the Lord and to love him (10:12). Exhortations to fear the Lord are found on eleven other occasions in Deuteronomy and exhortations to love the Lord another eight times. Usually these exhortations are accompanied by the requirement to observe the commandments Moses has taught.

<span id="page-97-3"></span>The making of any kind of object to represent Yahweh is a further misunderstanding of the God of Mount Sinai. The likeness or form of such an object in the ancient world was deemed to represent a god, though the representation was not that of physical appearance. Statues of Baal depict him in the form of a human with a club in one hand (to represent thunder) and a sprig or lightning bolt in the other. Baal is the rider of the clouds to bring rain and fertility. His image, however, is that of a calf. Baal may be depicted as standing on the back of a calf, which acts as a pedestal, because Baal is the god of fertility, bringing prosperity. The object of a calf, therefore, is an "image" or "likeness" of Baal because it represents him. The function of the image is to confess the power of the god and to seek his presence. Such objects are categorically forbidden for Israel. The only form or likeness that can represent God is the one he created, namely, living human beings. At Sinai, Israel is declared to be a "kingdom of priests" (Ex. 19:6). To make some other object in order to represent the Creator is to subvert the very function for which God has ordained his people. The rule of God on earth is represented in the tabernacle (or temple), but this depiction of the palace of God with all of its attendant ritual is a far more complex confession of the person and presence of God than any object. Idols are therefore abhorrent.

<span id="page-97-0"></span>The God of Mount Sinai cannot be anything other than a "jealous God." This is not a statement of envy but rather serves to express the possibility of insult. Israel would not be tempted to deny God outright; the danger was in having "other gods before me," that is, in opposition to the God of the covenant. Any

such god must be in opposition to Yahweh because of the absolute nature of his rule. There can be no place for subservience to some other power; the notion that there could be some other contributing power to the redeemed people is an affront and provokes the jealousy of God. The consequences of such compromise are not limited to the offender. Sin always affects those associated with the sinner, particularly the immediate family, which may extend to three or four generations in a household. Conversely, individual fidelity to the life-giving Creator has a benefit to one's family. In judicial affairs, the law of Moses will strictly limit responsibility to the offending individual, but the life of a covenant people is never a matter of individual independence. Divine judgment on an individual will affect the whole community, most immediately the family of the offender.

<span id="page-98-9"></span><span id="page-98-4"></span>5:11 The third word forbids false oaths. To "take the name" is a metaphor for speaking, taking God's name on one's lips (Ps. 16:4). To take the name "of the Lord your God in vain" is to declare an oath falsely. Hosea condemns Israel for unfaithfulness because of its "swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery" (Hos. 4:2). This reference in Hosea employs the Hebrew *ʾaloh wekahesh* ("to curse and to lie"). Jeremiah asks, "Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely?" (Jer. 7:9); to swear with a lie (*sheqer*) is the equivalent of taking the name in vain (*shaweʾ*).

<span id="page-98-13"></span><span id="page-98-12"></span><span id="page-98-1"></span>Accepting the covenant was done with an oath. At the foot of Mount Sinai, Moses "took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people" (Ex. 24:7). The "blood of the covenant" (Ex. 24:8) was then sprinkled on the people. In the seventh century Josiah would renew this covenant by reading "the Book of the Covenant" to the people as he "made a covenant before the Lord" (2 Kings 23:2–3).29 When Asa renewed the covenant with all Israel, they "swore an oath to the Lord" and "rejoiced over the oath" because they had sought the Lord with their whole desire (2 Chron. 15:14–15). The third word follows naturally from the confession that Yahweh alone is the God of Israel.

<span id="page-98-10"></span><span id="page-98-7"></span><span id="page-98-6"></span>In a temple liturgy, the psalmist asks who may ascend the "hill of the Lord" (Ps. 24:3). The answer is that only one with a pure heart who has not staked his life on what is vain (*shaweʾ*) may so ascend, one that does not "swear deceitfully" (Ps. 24:4). In this psalm the third word is contextualized in temple ritual. Worship demands fidelity to the oath sworn in covenant allegiance to the Lord.

<span id="page-98-11"></span><span id="page-98-5"></span><span id="page-98-3"></span><span id="page-98-2"></span>5:12–15 The observance of the Sabbath is a confession of covenant fidelity. The significance of the Sabbath as a sign is explained in Exodus 31:12–17, where the explanation concludes the instructions given on the mountain for the function of the tabernacle and the rituals of the priests. The Sabbath is a sign "that I, the Lord, sanctify you" (Ex. 31:13). At the mountain the Lord made a covenant with Israel to make them a "treasured possession among all the peoples," to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (Ex. 19:5–6). As a sign of the covenant, the Sabbath

<span id="page-98-8"></span><span id="page-98-0"></span><sup>29</sup> The term "tablet" (Hb. *sepher*) of the covenant is found only in these contexts of taking the oath of allegiance to Yahweh. The *sepher* may have the older sense that refers to a writing surface or monument, as in Job 19:23, appropriate to the two tablets of stone.

testifies that Israel is set apart to represent all peoples to God as a priestly nation. They are holy in their function because they have the role of representing the rule of God to all other peoples as priests. The Sabbath is to be the sign of the covenant people for all time.

<span id="page-99-9"></span><span id="page-99-7"></span><span id="page-99-0"></span>The Sabbath has always been controversial in its observance. In Numbers 15:32–36 the case of a man gathering wood is brought before Moses and Aaron. The Torah specifically forbids the making of a fire on the Sabbath (Ex. 35:2–3), but not the gathering of wood. The man is placed in custody because it is not clear what should be done. The question appears to be what penalty should be meted out rather than whether the act itself is a covenant violation. The divinely determined penalty indicates that this case is a flaunting of the covenant vow, apparently on the analogy of the gathering of manna in Exodus 16:27–29. If gathering food necessary for life is not to be done on the seventh day, then gathering wood used to boil manna rolls (Num. 11:8) is equally prohibited on the seventh day. The stipulation of the Sabbath penalty is given in the context of the building of the tabernacle (Ex. 31:14; 35:2–3). The inference seems to be that not even the need to build the tabernacle could preclude the sanctity of the Sabbath. Observance of the Sabbath is sacred above all duties because it gives testimony to trust in God and to faithfulness to the covenant vow.

<span id="page-99-8"></span><span id="page-99-6"></span><span id="page-99-4"></span><span id="page-99-1"></span>Given the high value placed on the sanctity of Sabbath observance, it is remarkable that no regulation is found concerning its observance. No definition is provided for what constitutes proscribed labor. The Torah mentions several kinds of tasks that should not be done on the Sabbath: leaving one's abode to gather food (Ex. 16:29), agricultural work (Ex. 34:21), lighting a fire (Ex. 35:3), and gathering wood (Ex. 35:3). The rabbis inferred that any task involved in the building of the tabernacle was work forbidden on the Sabbath because the instructions for tabernacle construction in Exodus 25:1–31:11 were concluded by the Sabbath sign in Exodus 31:12–17. The acts of labor prohibited on the Sabbath were forty categories less one (Mishah, Shabbat *7:2*). Jesus, however, correctly interprets the fourth word of the Decalogue: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" (Mark 2:27). As with the other words, time and circumstance determine how the imperative stated is to be upheld. Work was never meant to be toil, such as Israel endured in Egypt. The Sabbath confession of redemption requires that toil of life be set aside on the seventh day.

<span id="page-99-11"></span><span id="page-99-10"></span><span id="page-99-5"></span><span id="page-99-3"></span><span id="page-99-2"></span>5:16 Honoring parents serves as a connecting link between the affirmation of a relationship with God and the values governing relationships within the community. The latter are dependent on the former; unless exclusive allegiance to the Creator is pursued, as confessed in the first four words, the requirement to maintain relationships of integrity within creation is meaningless. The authority of the God of the covenant rests on the truth of his claim that "all the earth is mine" (Ex. 19:5). The truth of this claim is seen in how God delivered Israel from the Egyptians: "I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself" (Ex. 19:4).

The God of all peoples grants human life through father and mother. Parents must hold to the values of God, who has given them life. Children receive the gift of life from parents. Because father and mother are subject to an authority above that of all human authority, they in turn constitute an authority to be respected by their children.

<span id="page-100-9"></span><span id="page-100-1"></span>Leviticus 19:2–3 joins together three commands: "You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy. Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths." Observing the Sabbath as a means of honoring God has its counterpart in honoring parents. Isaiah 58:13–14 calls for the Sabbath to be honored (Hb. *kabad*). Leviticus in turn commands each person to respect (*yaraʾ*) his or her parents, while the command in Deuteronomy is to honor parents (*kabad*). The former forbids a person to contradict parents in their words or to try to take their place, while the latter includes taking care of them in terms of food, clothing, and shelter.

The reward for care of parents is longevity in the land. Property is fundamental to family life. Torah makes provision for families to retain property perpetually, even in situations of debt or death. The right and ability of children to inherit property depends on the integrity of the family. While the keeping of the covenant is necessary for long life in the land (Deut. 4:40), this promise is particularly pertinent to the command to honor parents. The right of future generations to inherit the land from their parents is contingent on the generations' honoring them.

<span id="page-100-8"></span><span id="page-100-7"></span><span id="page-100-5"></span><span id="page-100-4"></span><span id="page-100-3"></span><span id="page-100-2"></span>5:17 "Murder" is the correct translation of the Hebrew *ratsakh* in the sixth word, but it is inclusive of every type of homicide. The verb *ratsakh* is used for an unintentional homicide, referring to the person protected in a city of refuge (Deut. 19:4); accidental actions cannot be prohibited, but the action is still homicide. Numbers 35:27 uses *ratsakh* to refer to an avenger of blood's lawful killing of a "manslayer" outside a city of refuge. Further, Numbers 35:30 states that a murderer shall be put to death (*ratsakh*) on the evidence of witnesses. Proverbs 22:13 puts *ratsakh* in the mouth of a lazy person who makes the excuse that a lion will "kill" him in the street. All other occurrences are used in a legal context and mean either "murder" or "manslaughter." In English as well the generic word "kill" takes on more specific associations of criminal guilt in phrases such as "No one witnessed the killing" or "They found the killer." While the verb has a broader meaning, certain constructions limit the sense to a more refined and specific meaning.30 The intent of this word is to protect human life from conspired attack. The prohibition does not pertain to executions or death in warfare, which are other kinds of homicide.

<span id="page-100-6"></span>5:18 Adultery is the violation of marriage by engaging in sexual relations with another man's wife or a woman engaged to be married. If a married man has relations with an unmarried woman before the bridal price is paid, he is obligated to pay the dowry and marry her (Ex. 22:16–17). There is a presumption of consent

<span id="page-100-0"></span><sup>30</sup> In nominal phrases the sense is specifically limited. For example, *the painting* refers to a work of art, not the act of painting a house.

on the part of the woman; in the circumstance she has agreed, she is not in any sense coerced. If the father does not agree to the marriage, his daughter is free to marry again without suffering financial loss.

<span id="page-101-9"></span>The prohibition of adultery is to protect the family. Family integrity is critical to the well-being of the entire covenant community. Violation of family sanctity is an offense so severe it is punishable by death (Deut. 22:22). Stable families provide for the security and education of children, as well as the continuing possession of property for economic well-being.

<span id="page-101-6"></span><span id="page-101-2"></span><span id="page-101-1"></span>5:19 The most severe form of theft is the kidnapping and selling of a fellow human as a slave, a crime punishable by death (Ex. 21:16). All stolen property is to be fully restored, including payment for damages (Ex. 22:1–4, 7–9). Property is essential for life; nothing less than the full restoration of stolen property could be considered justice.

<span id="page-101-10"></span><span id="page-101-7"></span><span id="page-101-5"></span>5:20 Words determine relationships. Sometimes words are a direct testimony against another, such as the words Amos was commissioned to speak against Israel concerning its sin (Amos 3:13). Deuteronomy expresses this uniquely; such testimony must not be vain (Hb. *shaweʾ*), the same word used in connection with taking oaths (Deut. 5:11). In the case of an oath, *shaweʾ* has the sense of being ineffectual. It might carry that same sense here by defining false testimony as any circumvention of the truth. But the primary force of this prohibition is against making false statements about another person, as is clear in the vocabulary of Leviticus 19:11, which repeats this prohibition using two words for "lie" (*tekahashu*; *teshaqeru*). The people of Israel must not be deceitful or false in their dealings with each other.

<span id="page-101-8"></span><span id="page-101-3"></span>5:21 Scholars debate whether the tenth word prohibits the bare desire of what belongs to another or merely the actions taken to fulfill such a desire. The word must at least include the contemplation of such actions. The tenth word in Deuteronomy is different from Exodus in two important respects. Coveting the wife of one's neighbor is distinguished from all other desires, set apart by use of two different verbs in separate sentences. The second verb (Hb. *'awwah*) has the sense of "crave," suggesting that coveting itself is a violation, whether or not any action is taken. The clause sequence of Deuteronomy differs dramatically from Exodus in naming the wife of another household first. House is then listed along with fields and other properties. "House" in Deuteronomy has the restricted definition of a dwelling rather than a home. These differences are significant in ensuring a respected place for women within the household.

<span id="page-101-4"></span><span id="page-101-0"></span>There is always a tendency for men to be oppressive of women, as declared in Genesis 3:16. Moses begins the Ten Words by declaring that the source of authority is the Lord who has brought Israel out of the house of bondage (Deut. 5:6). Including a wife as part of a household could empower a husband to engage in the kind of bondage that Pharaoh exercised over Israelite homes. Redemption from Egypt must deliver every Israelite from the Egyptian type of slavery.

<span id="page-102-4"></span><span id="page-102-3"></span>Coveting may be a purely mental activity or may refer to concrete actions. Exodus 34:24 warns against making plans to take over the field of a neighbor when he goes to the central place of worship three times a year. A possible move to acquire the property of another is to shift the original boundary line (Deut. 19:14). However, the prohibition of the tenth word precludes even schemes or plots to acquire another's property, not merely maneuvers or deliberate actions to carry them out.

#### *Response*

The order of the prohibitions of murder, adultery, and theft varies in the traditions. The order of the Masoretic Text testifies to a logical progression. Values for life begin with what postmodernism calls a metanarrative, that is, a discourse of legitimation, a philosophy used to authenticate knowledge.31 Christian confession begins with the affirmation of Yahweh as revealed at Sinai. Its foundation is the experience of Israel in receiving the divine word, not in legitimation derived from rationalism, which is simply a way of reason's legitimizing itself. God is the person of Yahweh known through his interaction with people he has created. Human life is not only a gift from God; humans are designated by God to represent him. Therefore, human life is to be protected in distinction from all other life created by God (Gen. 9:6). Homicide is a violation of the fundamental will of God. This is followed by prohibition of adultery as a protection of marriage, which is the context for the continuation of human life. Theft is a violation of property that represents the work of life. Deceitful words are a crime against life, often in false claims of property, as in Exodus 22:6–8. Coveting is a violation of life by intent, apart from any explicit action. The tenth word addresses the mind, the source of all life values.

<span id="page-102-5"></span><span id="page-102-2"></span><span id="page-102-0"></span>Confession of Yahweh as creator and redeemer is made publicly and regularly through the Sabbath. Isaiah 56:1–2 express this fundamental distinction of faith. The poetic lines have a dramatic effect:

 Keep justice, and do righteousness, for soon my salvation will come, and my righteousness be revealed. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath, not profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.

<span id="page-102-1"></span>Righteousness (*tsedeqah*) in Hebrew is a deliverance, the doing of a good deed. It reflects what God did for Abraham when he believed (Gen. 15:6); it is the salvation that God will bring to his world.

<sup>31</sup> Cf. Jean-François Lyotard, *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge*, trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi, THL 10 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984); originally published as *La Condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir* (Paris: Minuit, 1974). The term *postmodernism* begins with philosophers such as Lyotard, who addressed the problem of legitimation in a report to the Conseil des Universitiés of the government of Quebec. To simplify to the extreme we can say that he defined postmodern as incredulity toward metanarrative.

<span id="page-103-0"></span>Sabbath is always a testimony to divine redemption. In Exodus the reason for the Sabbath is that the Lord made the heavens and the earth in six days and "rested on the seventh day" (Ex. 20:11). This verse refers to the Sabbath of Genesis 2:1–3, where divine rest shows that all is in order and at peace. This is the world that God is creating. The Genesis creation story is demythologized; it does not include the combat motif found in other creation accounts. Instead, Genesis gives an account of God's ordering his work so that all is at peace, a complete absence of conflict. The Sabbath in Exodus is testimony to this divine rest. Deuteronomy, however, states that in the Sabbath Israel must remember that they were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord delivered them "with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm" (Deut. 5:15). God had been at work to provide the peace of creation for a holy people in the Land of Promise; there they would find rest (Josh. 21:43–45).

<span id="page-103-4"></span><span id="page-103-3"></span><span id="page-103-2"></span><span id="page-103-1"></span>Psalm 95 recalls the rebellion of the wilderness that prevented the first generation from entering the rest of the Promised Land. But the psalm is a further call to hear (obey) the voice of God in order to enter that rest, lest those of the present day be like the wilderness generation. The writer to the Hebrews quotes this psalm at length to make the Christian application (Heb. 3:7–11). The rest promised Israel and signified by the Sabbath is to be found in the redemption of Christ: "There remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his" (Heb. 4:9–10). The writer to the Hebrews brings Sabbath full circle to Genesis 2:1–3. The redemption of Christ will complete the purpose for which God made the world and enable those in Christ to enjoy that rest. The significance of Sabbath is therefore the same for Christians as it was for Israel.

<span id="page-103-5"></span>Sabbath is unique to Israel in the ancient world.32 This is remarkable, since seven-day units of time observed as weeks and seasons are known throughout the Mesopotamian world, based on precise calculations of phases of the moon and the solar cycle. By 747 BC Babylonian astronomers knew that 235 lunar months were the same number of days as nineteen solar years. But the Sabbath cycles are completely separated from the movement of celestial bodies. Their purpose is strictly confessional: God is outside of nature and sovereign over it. Further, God is at work redeeming the world to conform to his creative purpose. In the NT, Christians began to make this confession on the day of the resurrection, a commanding statement of their faith in the redemption of Christ.

#### *Section Overview: Fear of the Lord*

The prologue develops the central requirement of Deuteronomy: Israel must fear the Lord. The experience of hearing the voice of God engendered fright in <span id="page-105-6"></span><span id="page-105-0"></span>this encounter with the holy. Israel had heard the voice of God and lived (Deut. 5:26), but the experience could not be continued. This thought is expressed similarly in Exodus 20:20: "God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin." Fear spread over the face is fright and dread, the same response experienced by the nations because of God's might in his people (Deut. 2:25).

<span id="page-105-7"></span><span id="page-105-2"></span>The exhortation of Moses in Deuteronomy, however, expresses the idea of Exodus 20:20 differently: if only the people had a heart to fear God, they would always keep his commandments (Deut. 5:29). Fear of the Lord in the heart is not to be equated with fear of the Lord on the face. Fear in the heart is an inner commitment that fears failure; fear on the face is terror stirred by external circumstance. The latter is an experience to be remembered; the former must be learned. The encounter with God at the mountain brought fear of death to the face (Deut. 5:25). Such a learning experience must become a fear of Lord in the heart, an attitude of mind that fears God with a continuing desire to do all that he has commanded.

<span id="page-105-8"></span><span id="page-105-5"></span>While in the valley opposite Beth-peor, on the cusp of entering the Promised Land, Moses instructs Israel in the ways of God so that they might fear of the Lord and keep the requirements of the covenant (Deut. 6:2). Israel has the opportunity to become a great and prosperous nation, as God promised their fathers. But the promise is dependent on learning to live according to the instructions of the covenant relationship. Covenant faithfulness is integral to relationship with God, who gives them the land, and to integrity within the community, so they might live in the land. The fear of the Lord for those that stood at the mountain must become the fear of God in the hearts of the new generation—a learning of the spiritual values taught in Deuteronomy. Safety is found only in the fear of the Lord.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-105-3"></span>5:22 Inscription in stone is required for permanency. Stone inscriptions in the ancient world included royal records, boundary markers, and treaties. These tablets may have had an appearance very similar to extant decrees on smaller tablets. Two tablets inscribed on both sides about 16 inches (40 cm) square would have accommodated the 189 words of the Decalogue as found in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-105-4"></span><span id="page-105-1"></span>5:23–27 The theophany at the mountain revealed the majestic presence of the living God. Other gods were encountered in lifeless statues, but the glory of the Lord appeared to the Israelites as a burning fire at the top of the mountain (Ex. 24:17). No human had heard the words of God in this fashion and lived. Moses was urged to be the mediator to relate the words of the covenant to the people, which they would willingly obey.

<span id="page-106-1"></span>5:28–31 The request of the people that Moses receive the commandments, rules, and regulations was divinely approved. These elements would provide the knowledge required to live according to the Ten Words, which state the conditions for membership in the community of the faithful. The experience of hearing the Ten Words set out the requirement for being able to live according to their values. It is a fundamental premise of the Bible that humans have a freedom of choice that does not incline them toward the subordination required of covenant obedience. The fear manifested by the people in their experience at the mountain would enable them to live prosperously in the land God was giving them. Such fear is not terror, in light of the security of the covenant relationship.

<span id="page-106-3"></span>5:32–33 There can be no compromise of the covenant relationship in any violation of the requirements revealed at the mountain. Their divine origin is self-evident. They are a prerequisite for shalom in the Promised Land.

<span id="page-106-6"></span><span id="page-106-5"></span><span id="page-106-4"></span><span id="page-106-2"></span>6:1–3 Israel is to learn the "whole commandment [*mitzvah*]" (Deut. 5:31), a statement made in describing the role of Moses as mediator (e.g., Deut. 8:1). "Commandment" is found in these and several other verses to express the basic demand for loyalty (7:11; 8:1; 11:8, 22; 30:11). The term corresponds to the demand for allegiance known from the treaties of the ancient world. The distinction may be observed in Jeremiah 32:11, which refers to the two basic parts of a deed of purchase, translated as "the terms [*hammitsvah*] and conditions [*hahuqqim*]." In covenant terms this is a summary of the basic stipulation and the specified terms.

<span id="page-106-9"></span>Although Deuteronomy is the final word on God's call and redemption of Israel, it is written as a document preparing the people for life in the land. Moses now looks to the future time when Israel will cross the Jordan. He is teaching them with the hope that they might learn to fear God and enjoy the prosperity of life under the covenant. The fear of the Lord is the standard by which the life of the people in the land is evaluated. This may be observed repeatedly in the prophetic message to Israel from first to last. At Gilgal, the angel of the Lord brings the indictment that Israel has broken the covenant with Yahweh (Judg. 2:1–5). They have ignored the prohibition against making treaties with the people of the land; therefore, the Lord will not drive out the nations, and their gods will be a snare to Israel. The response of the people is to weep and offer sacrifices. They have failed to keep the commandment, though they have not yet turned to other gods.

<span id="page-106-8"></span><span id="page-106-7"></span><span id="page-106-0"></span>When Israel suffers the invasion of Midian, an unnamed prophet arises to warn them against fearing the Amorites rather than the Lord (Judg. 6:7–10). Jeremiah uses the language of Deuteronomy 5:28 in expressing God's future purpose for Israel following their failure: "I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever. . . . I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will <span id="page-107-5"></span>not turn away from doing good to them" (Jer. 32:39–40). The fear of the Lord is a way of thinking; it is an attitude of mind. Fear of the Lord must be learned from generation to generation. It is not an experience that can be remembered but is rather a response of humility and obedience.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-107-1"></span><span id="page-107-0"></span>Several important features distinguish the Ten Words from the greater Torah and from all the rest of revelation. This is the only revelation Israel receives directly from God, since at Mount Sinai Israel sees his glory (Deut. 5:24). Though the words initially are heard, they are also written from the beginning by God himself (Ex. 31:18; Deut. 10:1–5). These words are given as fundamental values; they must never be reduced to rules and must never be compromised. These values govern human life in this world; therefore, their truth extends to all people of all time. Disregard of these values results in chaos and self-destruction in human society. Although these words are recorded by God, they become a human responsibility. They must be preserved and taught to each generation. As explained by Paul, these words define what is meant by love (Rom. 13:8–10). They summarize the attitude that is to govern all relationships. The only debt those bearing God's image should have is that of loving others, but this is a debt that never goes away. Only these words are universal and eternal; all other stipulations are limited and derive from them.

<span id="page-107-6"></span><span id="page-107-3"></span><span id="page-107-2"></span>If love is the demand of the covenant, the corollary must be fear of failing in that love. The fear of the Lord is much more than just respect of him. He is a consuming fire (Deut. 5:25). The fear inspired by the terrifying appearance of God at the mountain was a lesson in learning to love (v. 29). Such fear of offending God because he is always present will lead to the observance of the commandments for the good of all. This is the reason for the wisdom dictum that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Job 28:28; Prov. 1:7; 9:10; Eccles. 5:7; 12:13). Fear of the Lord is the central maxim of each of the wisdom books. Whatever be the questions of life, the response must begin with the fear of the Lord experienced at the mountain.

<span id="page-107-4"></span>The sad reality of human behavior is that mental knowledge does not lead to a corresponding rational response. Knowing that drug use kills, whether it be tobacco, alcohol, or more lethal opioids, does not prevent people from using them. Even medical use of drugs is all too frequently violated to the endangerment of life. Even more dangerous than such practices as these is failure to fear the Lord and to obey the words written by the finger of God. Violence to human society is the most pernicious perpetrator of death, all of it resulting from a failure to fear God.

<span id="page-109-3"></span><span id="page-109-2"></span><span id="page-109-1"></span><span id="page-109-0"></span>The exhortation begins with the demand of loyalty, the topic of chapters 6–11. Verses 1–3 are a transition, continuing the discourse of "the whole commandment and the statues and the rules" (5:31). These verses also serve to introduce the essential creed in 6:4–5. The Shema, as these verses are known, constitutes a theoretical restatement of the first two words of the Decalogue. The first word is affirmed in the statement that Yahweh is one, and the requirement of exclusive love for God denies the worship of any other deity. The admonitions to keep this Torah in chapters 6–11 elaborate the basic demand of loyalty to God. All the other specific requirements explained in chapters 12–26 derive from this principal command.

<span id="page-109-14"></span><span id="page-109-7"></span><span id="page-109-6"></span>The whole commandment taught by Moses can be summarized in the demand to love God in thought, desire, and strength (6:4–5). This Hebrew word for love (*ʾahab*) has a broad range of meaning. It includes love in marital, family, and community relationships (10:19; 15:16; 21:15–16), but in Deuteronomy "love" is used almost exclusively to define the relationship between God and his people. The duty of love for God is founded on his love for Israel (10:14–15). Love in Deuteronomy does not have the same ethical emphasis as in the NT, where it stands in contrast with a love for the world. The love commanded by Moses is an exclusive adherence to God in contrast to serving other gods. In most of its approximately twenty occurrences in Deuteronomy, the term expresses the obligation of keeping the covenant with all its responsibilities, as it does in the conclusion of the prologue to this Torah (11:1, 13). This love is not a legalism but involves a living and dynamic desire for God that may be expressed as "holding fast to him" (11:22). The term is found at the beginning and end of the prologue as the commandment that Moses must teach them (6:5; 11:22). The requirement to teach this love is found at the introduction and conclusion of the exhortation to observe this Torah (6:4–9; 11:18–21). Moses emphasizes that the instruction to love God must be taught repeatedly, from rising in the morning to retiring at night, while at home and when on a journey.

<span id="page-109-13"></span><span id="page-109-12"></span><span id="page-109-10"></span><span id="page-109-9"></span><span id="page-109-8"></span><span id="page-109-5"></span><span id="page-109-4"></span>Chapter 6 is structured around the command to teach each generation of Israel to love God through keeping the commandments (vv. 6–9, 20–25). Two examples are given as to how Israel might fail to love God. Times of prosperity might lead them to neglect the God who has abundantly given them blessings (vv. 10–15). On the other hand, times of trial might lead them to test God, as they had in the wilderness (vv. 16–19). Circumstances of weal and woe can be equally threatening to trusting in God—to showing the fear and love required by the covenant.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-110-4"></span>6:4–5 These words have unique significance in Deuteronomy as they begin the essence of the instruction God gave Moses. They are well known as the summary of the teaching of Moses and are among the oldest confessions preserved from antiquity. A document called the Nash Papyrus (c. 100 BC) was discovered in Egypt in 1902.33 The composite text, used in liturgy, contains the Decalogue, followed by the introductory formula of Deuteronomy 4:45 and the Shema. In contemporary time these two verses are the centerpiece of daily Jewish worship called the *Keriʾat Shemaʿ* ("Recitation of the Shema"). The name *Shema* derives from the first Hebrew word of the recitation.

<span id="page-110-7"></span><span id="page-110-2"></span>Although the Shema is one of the best-known confessions of the OT, its precise translation is uncertain. The NJPS interprets the verse as a statement of allegiance: "Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone." This is syntactically defensible, though not common. "The Lord our God" occurs twenty-two times in Deuteronomy, but in virtually no other case can it be read as a subject and a predicate (i.e., "The Lord is our God"). Further, use of the word "one" (*ʾechad*) to express "alone" is unusual. In any case, this interpretation stresses that, for mankind, the name Yahweh will be unrivaled (cf. Zech. 14:9). The traditional translation of the Shema makes a statement about the nature of Yahweh: "The Lord our God, the Lord is one." This makes the God of Israel unique and incomparable, which is the usual meaning of *ʾechad* ("one"). The Shema has come to be the preeminent expression of monotheism. Deuteronomy elsewhere makes explicit declarations that there is no other God (Deut. 4:35, 39; 32:39). Whatever other gods or powers may be supposed, they are utterly subordinate under the dominion of Yahweh. Both interpretations focus the instruction of Moses in the Torah into a single sentence.

<span id="page-110-3"></span><span id="page-110-1"></span>The love required by Israel's God demands action. The second word concluded with the blessing that would come to "those who love me and keep my commandments" (Deut. 5:10). It is impossible to love God while not fulfilling the requirements of the relationship. Love and loyalty toward God are synonymous with a way of life. The emotional attachment of love is expressed in behavior. God loves humans, as conveyed in his actions of providing the stranger with "food and clothing" (10:18). If Israel loves God, the people will walk in all his ways and serve him with every thought and desire (10:12). To love is to act in a loving manner, as described in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-110-6"></span><span id="page-110-5"></span>Deuteronomy is the first book of the Bible to demand love for God. Previously the emphasis was on fear of God, an awe of his grandeur and a dread of his judgment that serve as motives for obedience (4:10). Deuteronomy demands both love

<span id="page-110-0"></span><sup>33</sup> F. C. Burkitt, "The Hebrew Papyrus of the Ten Commandments," *JQR* 15/3 (April 1903): 392–408.

<span id="page-111-6"></span><span id="page-111-5"></span><span id="page-111-4"></span><span id="page-111-0"></span>and fear as the motivations for keeping the covenant (10:12). Heart, soul, and might are ways of describing every aspect of personal commitment. The heart (*lebab*) is the center of thought and intention. Most often it is equivalent to the mind. God tested Israel to know what was on their mind and to determine whether they would obey (8:2). Thus the people must know in their mind that God is disciplining them as a person corrects a child (8:5). The word *nephesh* ("soul") is not exclusive to humans; God created every creature that moves on the ground or in the air with breath (*nephesh*; Gen. 1:21). In reference to humans, this term expresses desire. Once in the Promised Land, the *nephesh* of Israel would crave meat, and the people would eat meat according to the craving of their *nephesh* (Deut. 12:20; cf. 14:26). Strength (*meʾod*) is found as a noun only in this verse and at 2 Kings 23:25, the only other place in which these three words are used to express complete devotion to the covenant. It includes all the resources of a person's life. Since Yahweh is "one" and he alone can be the God of Israel, his people in turn must love him as "one," that is, as persons undivided in thought and desire, with all the strength that they have.

<span id="page-111-10"></span><span id="page-111-9"></span><span id="page-111-3"></span>6:6–9 The love God requires must be learned. This love is not limited to emotion; the commitments of the relationship of love must be carried out. Learning such love is not so much an intellectual demand as a way of thinking. The duties of the covenant must become instinctive. This emphasis is established in several ways. "These words that I command you" are a reference to the entire teaching of this Torah (cf. Deut. 12:28; 31:1, 28; 32:45–46). They are inclusive of all activities and relationships. This teaching must always be on the people's minds. For this to be possible, they must "teach them diligently" at all times. The Hebrew word *shanan* is used only here with the meaning to teach by means of repetition. That *teaching* is meant here, rather than prescribing duties (an alternate possible sense of the word), is certain because of the parallel 11:18–19, where "teach" (*lamad*) is used as a synonym. The means by which this repetition may take place is explained in the requirement for this to be done continuously. Teaching these words when they sit down or leave, when they lie down or rise, is inclusive of all activity, a figure of speech known as merism. Merisms consist of contrasting phrases to indicate totality—expressions such as "young and old," "rich and poor."

<span id="page-111-11"></span><span id="page-111-7"></span><span id="page-111-2"></span><span id="page-111-1"></span>In addition to being remembered and spoken of constantly, these words are even to be attached to one's body. A similar requirement is found at Exodus 13:9, 16, but in that context it is the commemorative ceremony that is to serve as a sign on the people's hands and foreheads. The words there must be taken metaphorically, with the meaning that the memory of the exodus must be a part of everything the people do and think. Deuteronomy specifies that it is the words themselves that must be bound to the body. It is obvious that in Qumran this command was followed literally, as many tefillin, or phylacteries, have been preserved. These are selected passages written out on parchment and placed in leather capsules worn on the wrists and foreheads. Jesus references these in Matthew 23:5. It is debatable whether Deuteronomy is requiring this literally, but it is certain that this practice

<span id="page-111-8"></span>

does not in itself fulfill the requirement, as Jesus teaches. The concept is no different than in Exodus, where the actions of the ceremony act as a constant reminder.

The gates of an ancient city were a structure with a roof and several chambers, sometimes large enough for a considerable assembly of people. Benches were a part of the rooms, with a long passageway between the chambers on each side. These chambers were a provision to ensure security for conducting various kinds of business. The gate was the most public place of a city, visited by virtually everyone in the city. It was the place for the display of royal inscriptions and charters' guaranteeing rights. Writing the teachings of the Torah on the gates of city walls would give them the widest possible exposure. This practice was undoubtedly intended to be carried out literally, as was customary for such public declarations. Even those who could not read would be reminded of the teaching they had been taught when they saw the writing.

Sometime during the emergence of Jewish law toward the time of the NT, it became the practice to write selected passages on parchment and place them into a container affixed to the doorposts of the house. This practice continues to the present time; the container is called a mezuzah, the Hebrew word for "doorpost" in this instruction.

<span id="page-112-2"></span>6:10–15 Ironically, the gift of the Promised Land is at the same time a serious threat to forgetting the commandment of love. Forgetting vows that have been taken is not a cognitive problem but a failure of commitment. Married couples forget their marriage vows despite pictures and recordings of the event. The love of Yahweh is expressed in his rich gifts of wealth—the great cities of Canaan would come into the possession of the Israelites. This tangible act of divine love demands an exclusive loyalty. Any compromise of loyalty is an insult to God and arouses his wrath. The fear of the Lord is an imperative, and failure to fear the Lord will result in Israel's being driven from the ground ("of the earth"; Hb. *ʾadamah*) to which it belongs.

This admonition repeats the requirements of the first three words of the Decalogue. Yahweh is a jealous God—there can be no other god; Israel must not be lured by the idols of Canaan; and they must swear by the name of Yahweh. All of these are statements of love and loyalty.

<span id="page-112-3"></span><span id="page-112-1"></span><span id="page-112-0"></span>6:16–19 Obedience to the demand of love and observance of the requirements of the covenant relationship must not be conditioned with expectation of miraculous deliverance from trials or difficulties. Moses here refers to the place remembered as "Massah" and "Meribah" ("testing" and "quarreling"; Ex. 17:7 ESV mg.), referencing the occasion narrated in Exodus 17:1–7, at which Israel had no access to water as it came near to Mount Sinai. The dire situation of the Israelites must not be minimized. Water requirements for such a vast people and its livestock were substantial. Water is essential within hours to avoid illness and death, and lack of water in times of drought has caused farmers to kill their livestock rather than have them suffer and die. Nevertheless, the response of Israel on this occasion

was a manifest lack of trust. Trust in such circumstances is a part of keeping the covenant terms, doing what is right and good. Failure of such trust would prevent the people from entering the Promised Land.

<span id="page-113-3"></span><span id="page-113-0"></span>6:20–25 It is the responsibility of each generation to teach the demand of love to the next one. These verses substantially repeat the introduction to the Decalogue (Deut. 5:1–5). The requirements of the covenant can be understood only in the context of the story of redemption, in which God takes Israel to be a treasured people. The Passover was the primary occasion on which the redemption story was taught and celebrated. These verses came to be fundamental to the roles observed in the Passover liturgy, known as the Haggadah. This confession of redemption finds its fulfillment when Jesus makes the Passover a memorial of his death to be observed regularly by his followers.

<span id="page-113-4"></span>The Lord commanded Israel "to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God" (6:24). The lack of a conjunction between these two phrases indicates that they are equivalent. Fear of the Lord is to keep all of the stipulations he has required in the covenant relationship.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-113-5"></span><span id="page-113-2"></span><span id="page-113-1"></span>A mezuzah is the most prominent identification of Jewish confession to this day. A small wooden or metal box containing Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 11:13–21, written on parchment by a spiritually qualified calligrapher, is attached to the doorpost (mezuzah) of the house. Deuteronomy 6:4–5 on the doorpost serves as a reminder to every person of the home of his obligation to love God in everything he does when he passes through the door. This passage is developed in Psalm 1 to describe the person who is approved by God, someone who meditates (Hb. *yehgeh*) on the Torah day and night. The verb suggests memorization that can be repeated. The Ten Words are to govern all decisions and actions. This psalm is further developed by Jesus in what is commonly called the Beatitudes (Matt. 5:3–11). The Greek word *makarios* ("blessed") translates the Hebrew word *'ashrey* found in Psalm 1 as Jesus explains the qualities that are to characterize his followers. Thus these verses can be no less significant for the Christian than the Jew, as they describe the quality of faith and conduct of life that God desires.

<span id="page-113-7"></span><span id="page-113-6"></span>The Shema is also the primary demand of wisdom. The first nine chapters of Proverbs instruct the intelligent but immature youth in how to live. Primary advice is given in 6:20–22:

 My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck. When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.

The Shema was a suitable response to the many theological challenges Jewish monotheism confronted until Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine. This confession as a national religion spared the Jewish people much of the martyrdom suffered by early Christians, who were regarded as atheists. The regular recitation of the Shema is the first requirement of Jewish instruction in the Mishnah. The opening of the first section, called Berakhot ("blessings"), contains detailed regulations for the recitation of the Shema in the evening and in the morning (1:1–4). Properly understood, this is a means of ensuring that every thought is directed in the way of blessing.

<span id="page-114-4"></span><span id="page-114-3"></span><span id="page-114-2"></span><span id="page-114-0"></span>Regular confession of faith is important, for trust in God is readily subverted. The failure at Meribah was long remembered as a failure of faith that resulted in death. Psalm 95, one such poetic remembrance, gives praise to God as the creator of the world (vv. 4–5) and creator of Israel (vv. 6–7). Worship of the Creator is nullified by the absence of faith, as demonstrated at Meribah (vv. 8–11). That generation died in the wilderness and would never enter God's rest. This same failure threatens the faith of Christians, as explained in the book of Hebrews, which interprets and applies Psalm 95 (Heb. 4:1–3). The cares of this world readily choke off the seed of the gospel that has begun to take root.

7"When the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and mightier than you, **<sup>2</sup>** and when the Lord your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction.*<sup>1</sup>* You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them. **3**You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons, **<sup>4</sup>** for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. **5**But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and chop down their Asherim and burn their carved images with fire.

**<sup>6</sup>** "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. **<sup>7</sup>** It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, **8**but it is because the Lord loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed

you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. **<sup>9</sup>**Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations, **<sup>10</sup>** and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face. **11**You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.

**<sup>12</sup>** "And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers. **13**He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you. **14**You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock. **15**And the Lord will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you. **16**And you shall consume all the peoples that the Lord your God will give over to you. Your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.

**<sup>17</sup>** "If you say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them?' **<sup>18</sup>** you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt, **<sup>19</sup>** the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out. So will the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. **<sup>20</sup>**Moreover, the Lord your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed. **21**You shall not be in dread of them, for the Lord your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God. **22**The Lord your God will clear away these nations before you little by little. You may not make an end of them at once,*<sup>2</sup>* lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you. **23**But the Lord your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed. **24**And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under heaven. No one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them. **25**The carved images of their gods you shall burn with fire.

You shall utterly detest and abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction."

#### *Section Overview: Israel and Canaanite Culture*

<span id="page-115-0"></span>The prologue continues with warnings of the dangers that may entice Israel to deviate from the mandate to love God, concluding with an oath of allegiance in Deuteronomy 11:26–32. Instructions for Israel on entrance into the Promised <span id="page-116-2"></span><span id="page-116-0"></span>Land are brief. As did Sihon, the Canaanites fall under the *kherem* (2:34–35; 7:3; cf. Introduction: Theology of Deuteronomy: Fidelity of the Covenant). No covenant may be made with them, and there may be no intermarriage. The people of God must not allow the Canaanites to lure them into worship of other gods. They must break the altars and pillars of Canaanite religion and burn down their places of worship (7:5). These brief instructions are followed by explanation, reflection, and exhortation to cling to the Lord alone. The numerical superiority of the Canaanites might lead Israel to fear and failure of trust. Conversely, a sense of self-sufficiency might lead the people to forget their dependence on God (ch. 8), and conquest may lead to a sense of self-righteousness (chs. 9–10). Moses warns against all these dangers, concluding with a repetition of the admonition to love God alone and keep his commandments.

<span id="page-116-11"></span><span id="page-116-8"></span><span id="page-116-4"></span><span id="page-116-1"></span>The dangers of Canaanite culture are expressed around the theme of numerical comparisons using the Hebrew root *rbb*. Chapter 7 begins by saying that God will remove many nations (*goyim-rabbim*) that are more numerous (*rabbim*) and stronger than Israel. In direct address to Israel, Moses says that God did not choose them because they were more numerous (*rubbekem*) than other people (v. 7); they were actually fewer in number. However, Moses promises that God will multiply them (*hirbeka*) and provide abundantly (v. 13). This admonition concludes with Moses' returning to the theme of the greater (*rabbim*) nations that Israel must not fear (v. 17), but all this will happen as a process lest the land become uninhabited and the wild animals become numerous (*tirbeh*) and dangerous (v. 22). These numerical references link each of the topics in the warnings and exhortations of this chapter.

<span id="page-116-12"></span><span id="page-116-10"></span><span id="page-116-9"></span><span id="page-116-7"></span><span id="page-116-6"></span><span id="page-116-5"></span><span id="page-116-3"></span>The continued exhortations of the prologue all have their focus on the first word of the Decalogue confessed in the Shema. Israel is a treasured people to Yahweh (7:6), and he is "God, the faithful God" (7:9). Israel must observe all of the commandments so that they may live (8:1) and not "forget the Lord" (8:14). They must not be deceived into thinking that the gift of the land is due to their righteousness (9:4). The sermon comes to a crescendo with the single divine requirement to "fear the Lord . . . to love him . . . with all your heart and with all your soul" (10:12). The Lord alone is their praise, and he has done all of these great and terrifying things that they have seen. The exhortation concludes as it began with the words of the Shema in 7:9: "Know . . . the Lord your God is God."

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-117-9"></span><span id="page-117-7"></span><span id="page-117-3"></span><span id="page-117-2"></span>7:1–6 God's actions in creating the nation of Israel and bringing them into the land are developed from the covenant words at Mount Sinai, especially as found in Exodus 23:20–33. Verbal affinity may be observed especially at the beginning and end of the sections (cf. Ex. 23:23, 24–26; Deut. 7:1, 5, 11–15). Deuteronomy places special emphasis on God's personal presence and his power (cf. Deut. 4:37), while Exodus often refers to the mediation of the angel of the Lord (e.g., Ex. 23:23). However, Exodus 33:14–15 speaks of the divine presence that is with Moses so that he can lead Israel to the Land of Promise. There is no single formula for referring to the mystery of God's guidance.

<span id="page-117-14"></span><span id="page-117-4"></span><span id="page-117-0"></span>The enemies of Israel are made tangible via this listing of some of the indigenous peoples of Canaan. Such lists appear with various names. Though none is exhaustive (e.g., Ex. 3:8, 17; 23:23, 28), the listing of seven nations is a symbolic totality to represent all of the nations of Canaan (cf. Acts 13:19). The Hittites were an empire that controlled northern Syria in the times leading up to the entrance of Israel into Canaan (Middle and Late Bronze Age; c. 1700–1200 BC), with their capital at the ancient Hattian city of Hattusha. The fall of Hattusha left the Arameans and the Hittites as two ruling ethnic groups in Syria. The Hittites of Canaan at the time of the conquest were settlers from various late Hittite kingdoms (Ezek. 16:3). In Deuteronomy 1:7 the Amorites and the Canaanites represent geographical areas of all of Canaan.

<span id="page-117-6"></span><span id="page-117-5"></span>Cultural integration was not possible for Israel because it would conflict with the covenant they had made with God. Israel must defeat these nations and "devote them to complete destruction." This is one way of translating the Hebrew expression *hakharem takharim ʾotam* (cf. Deut. 2:34). The term *kherem* is found outside of biblical literature in the Mesha Stele, on which the king of Moab commemorates his victory over the Omride dynasty of Israel. Mesha boasts, "I devoted" (*hhrmth*) the city of Nebo to the god Ashtar-Kamosh, killing everyone, seven thousand men, boys, women, girls, and pregnant women (lines 14–17a). Moses intends a similar representative action in acknowledging that God grants victory and that therefore everything belongs to God. Not every city will be devoted to such destruction, for God is granting Israel great and good cities they have not built and vineyards they have not planted (Deut. 6:10–11). But if Israel is to be the treasured people chosen by God to represent his kingdom to all peoples (Ex. 19:5; Deut. 7:6), then all idolatrous places of worship must be destroyed.

<span id="page-117-13"></span><span id="page-117-12"></span><span id="page-117-11"></span><span id="page-117-10"></span><span id="page-117-8"></span><span id="page-117-1"></span>Such places of worship are called *'asherim* in Hebrew (Deut. 7:5). This term is found twice in the Bible as the name of a Canaanite goddess (Judg. 3:7; 1 Kings 18:19), though in all other occurrences in the Bible and in inscriptions it is a common noun that takes articles and suffixes. An Asherah is a place of worship under a sacred grove (Deut. 16:21; Judg. 6:25–30). The Greek translators knew this and translated *'asherah* consistently as *halsos* ("grove"). These places of worship boasted a stone platform with various objects of worship such as an altar, a pillar, and carved images of wood and stone. Since all of these places of worship and their objects

represented various deities other than Yahweh, they all had to be broken up and burned. Only in this manner could Israel be a "people holy to the Lord," a people representing him as King over all the earth. The *kherem* is meant to be carried out fully and inclusively in relation to all Canaanite worship. Economic interaction with Canaanites, implicit in making a "covenant with them," as well as intermarriage with them, is impossible if their religion is to be systematically eradicated.

<span id="page-118-2"></span>7:7–11 Complacency is the nemesis of all relationships. *The grace of God opposes all merit, but it requires constant effort.* The Israelites must remember that God's choice to create them as a nation was through no merit of their own. God's oath ensures that he will fulfill all that is required for them to be a nation, but it also requires that they observe faithfully every commandment, rule, and regulation. Israel must be as faithful in keeping covenant as their God is (v. 9), for God repays in person ("to their face") those who hate him, those who compromise with another god. This knowledge is important to an unwavering faithfulness; it is the fear of the Lord that enables constant love for him.

<span id="page-118-4"></span><span id="page-118-3"></span>7:12–16 The promise of Canaanite gods was that they would supply fertility and health. Baal was a storm god, the one supposedly bringing rain and therefore fecundity in the land. Baalism is thus simply a religion of materialism. If Baal were worshiped and he were in power, the people would be rich. Moses instructs Israel to reject all such worship and its motivations. Israel must be inspired to love God because of his love for them. Their God is not miserly; the Lord will reward their faithfulness with an abundance incomparable to any other.

<span id="page-118-5"></span><span id="page-118-1"></span>7:17–21 The cities of Canaan were formidable. The Amarna Tablets (cf. comment on 1:26–28), from just before the time of Moses, describe city-states with large armies. Although the Egyptians attempted to control Canaan, powerful kings such as Labayu of Shechem were a daunting force controlling large areas of Canaan. Compared to cities such as Jerusalem, Megiddo, Acco, Byblos, Gaza, Joppa, and many others, Israel is indeed the least of all peoples. Canaan was controlled by powerful city states from south to north, many supported militarily by Egypt.

<span id="page-118-0"></span>The vast disparity between Israel and the powers of Canaanite cities is not to deter Israel from proceeding into the Land of Promise. God has already conquered Egypt in delivering the Israelites; that same God will send hornets among the Canaanites, so none can hide. The term "hornet" (Hb. *tsirʿah*) is found only in two other passages (Ex. 23:28; Josh. 24:12), and its power is never explained. It may well be a reference to the dread that the victories of Israel would spread over all the other kings. The NJPS translates *tsirʿah* as "plague." The image of swarms of wasps causing panic or frenzy describes well the power of God in bringing about the conquest of Canaan.

<span id="page-118-6"></span>7:22–26 The Israelites are too small to control the entire land of Canaan immediately. God will grant them only as much territory as they can occupy until they are sufficient in number for more. The process will continue until the great nations of Canaan are utterly extinct ("their name [will] perish"). The condition of such occupation is the destruction of all remnants of Canaanite idolatry, no matter the worth of their silver and gold, because they are abhorrent to the Lord. This wealth falls under the *kherem*, items dedicated to God and perpetually removed from common use. Anyone retaining such proscribed items will themselves become proscribed; they will face the same fate as the Canaanites whom the Israelites destroyed.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-119-3"></span>War is a part of the human condition, but Moses demands a perspective that the earth belongs to the Lord. For this reason, Israel does not fight wars of aggression. She is permitted to take only the land God has allotted to her. These nations are defeated by God and put under the *kherem* because they are under divine judgment and because the iniquity of the Amorites is full (Gen. 15:16). The wars of Deuteronomy are fought by God through the agency of the Israelites. Israel can be the divine agents only if they are faithful to the covenant. The wars of conquest have no similarity to other wars between nations when understood in their theological context.

Several points are pertinent for the Christian. There is an army of God to which all the citizens of his kingdom belong. Christians are soldiers of the cross, but the means of their warfare are not conventional. Their enemy is never an individual nation but rather the collective rebellion of mankind against God. Life must be lived for the kingdom of God. Individuals have only one life to give, and such an ultimate sacrifice must be worthy of service to the kingdom of God. For the Christian, human warfare does not determine the destiny of human society. Christians recognize that reliance on military power is the only way nations retain their power; at a minimum, there will always be defensive wars.

<span id="page-119-2"></span><span id="page-119-1"></span><span id="page-119-0"></span>The Christian is a citizen of various kingdoms of this world, but ultimate loyalty must belong to the kingdom of God. The Christian recognizes that it is the responsibility of human government to protect its citizens from violence (Gen. 9:6). Though government is faulty, often being the beast that tramples its own people, it is still the temporal means of restraining society from anarchy like that of Lamech (Gen. 4:23–24), which led to the universal destruction of the flood (Gen. 6:5). Christians must be grateful for state protection and be good citizens of the state. It is a challenge to fulfill duties of citizenship while having supreme loyalty to a kingdom not of this world. There are times when it is necessary to obey God rather than humans.

### <span id="page-120-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 8:1–20

8"The whole commandment that I command you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the Lord swore to give to your fathers. **2**And you shall remember the whole way that the Lord your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. **<sup>3</sup>**And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word*<sup>1</sup>* that comes from the mouth of the Lord. **4**Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years. **5**Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the Lord your God disciplines you. **<sup>6</sup>** So you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him. **7**For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills, **<sup>8</sup>** a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey, **<sup>9</sup>** a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. **10**And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.

**<sup>11</sup>** "Take care lest you forget the Lord your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today, **<sup>12</sup>** lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them, **<sup>13</sup>** and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied, **<sup>14</sup>** then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, **15**who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock, **16**who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, to do you good in the end. **17**Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.' **18**You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day. **19**And if you forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish. **20**Like the nations that the Lord makes to perish before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the Lord your God."

#### *Section Overview: Do Not Forget the Lord Your God*

<span id="page-121-8"></span><span id="page-121-7"></span>The argument of this chapter is based on history. The wilderness experience served to instruct the earlier generation to know that human resources are insufficient to sustain life. "Man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord" (Deut. 8:3). Mortals depend on God for the food they need. Life in the wilderness is set in contrast with life in the land of riches (8:2–5, 7–10, 12–13, 14–16). Dependence on God will be no less real when it is less desperately immediate. The lesson of the wilderness is that the people's provision comes through the Lord's fulfilling of his covenant (vv. 2, 18), which means they must not forget the commandments of the Lord, his redemption, and their relationship with God (vv. 11, 14, 19).

<span id="page-121-11"></span><span id="page-121-10"></span><span id="page-121-9"></span><span id="page-121-6"></span><span id="page-121-5"></span>Moses begins and ends with a reminder of the hardships of the wilderness (vv. 1–6, 14b–17). These are contrasted with the central section of the riches of the Land of Promise (vv. 7–10, 12–13). Verse 11 stands at the center of these two themes: "Take care lest you forget the Lord your God." The imperative to "take care" (Hb. *shamar*) is found in verses 1, 2, 6; "you forget" (*shakakh*) is found in verses 14, 19. The warning of 6:10–15 is taken up again as a central theme. The riches of the Promised Land pose a danger to trust in God; the experiences of the wilderness are testimony to such a threat.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-121-4"></span><span id="page-121-3"></span><span id="page-121-2"></span>8:1 The theme of numerical abundance with the Hebrew word *rabab* is continued from the previous chapter (cf. Section Overview of 7:1–26). Observing the covenant will give Israel the opportunity to "live and multiply"—cattle and flocks, silver and gold, everything they possess (v. 13). To observe the "whole commandment" expresses the demand for complete loyalty (cf. 6:1–3). Remembering God and obedience are not separate phenomena. To fail to keep the commandment is to forget God.

<span id="page-121-0"></span>8:2–5 These verses explain the concept of God's testing his people. Humans must have bread to live but are not capable of ensuring such a necessity. Therefore, it is not possible to live on bread alone. Deprivation of food in the wilderness was an opportunity for Israel to learn that they did not live by bread alone. Such a test revealed their actual attitude of mind. Did they know that God is able to guarantee the endurance of life when all human efforts fail? Such trust is essential to life. Mortals live by that which God decrees. The wilderness experience establishes the whole premise that power and wealth are not reliable. Such knowledge is essential to those about to enter a land of riches. The wilderness was a school house; there their clothes did not wear out nor their feet swell during forty years of journeys. This provision was the verdict of God.

Manna is sometimes explained as an edible honeydew (insect residue) produced in parts of the Sinai in June and July from the secretions of scale insects on tamarisk trees that crystalize and fall to the ground. The term *man* is used in Arabic for honeydew and some insects that produce it. If this is the food referenced in the narrative, it does not diminish the miraculous nature of the provision that enabled Israel to survive.

<span id="page-122-6"></span><span id="page-122-5"></span><span id="page-122-0"></span>8:6–10 The land Israel is about to enter is described in metaphors accentuating its contrast with the wilderness. This land flows with water; springs and deep fountains feed surging streams in the hills and on the broad open valleys. The term "valleys" describes vast land areas like that of Megiddo (2 Chron. 35:22; Zech. 12:11). Such land yields food in abundance of immense variety: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey (possibly the nectar of fruits). This is a stock list of items; Sennacherib has a similar description of the land (2 Kings 18:32). This is a land yielding metals of iron and copper for manufacturing tools, especially in the Transjordan, the Jordan Valley south of the Dead Sea, and the rift toward the Gulf of Aqaba. Lands of such wealth readily neglect the poor, the primary concern of God in covenant loyalty. It is more difficult to trust God amid such plenty, to bless him for the goodness he has provided.

<span id="page-122-4"></span><span id="page-122-1"></span>8:11–13 The people entering this land of riches are very capable. Their herds and flocks will proliferate, and their investments will increase exponentially. How can such people not become proud? They must remember Egypt and the wilderness.

<span id="page-122-3"></span><span id="page-122-2"></span>8:14–18 Egypt and the wilderness are described with metaphorical force equivalent to the wealth of the Promised Land. Egypt was a place of slavery, while the wilderness hid serpents with a bite that burned like fire and scorpions with the sting of a lead-tipped whip (1 Kings 12:11, 14). The multitudes of Israel lacked the most vital provisions of water and food and were thus utterly helpless. But by God's decree, water emerged from the flint rock and manna gathered on the ground. Such provision for life could not be explained. There is no greater test than utter dependence; it is the ultimate hardship. All this happened for the good of the people. When they think they are providing for themselves, they must remember the lesson of the wilderness: all strength and all wealth are the gift of God. Such gifts are received completely apart from merit. The gifts of life and prosperity are given because God cannot fail to keep the oath made with their fathers. The divine

decree was responsible for their coming into existence as a people and entering a land of riches.

<span id="page-123-4"></span>8:19–20 Wealth and prosperity, which are not gained by ability or merit of the people that possess them, cannot be retained by means of their power. Moses knew very well the lure of the Canaanite gods of materialism and the deception of Baal, the god who could supposedly be manipulated for prosperity. Wealth breeds a desire for wealth and duplicity that seeks to attain more wealth. Forgetting the life-giver will result in the destruction of Israel, just as with the Canaanites before them. Israel does not live by bread alone.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-123-5"></span><span id="page-123-1"></span>This passage is well known from the Gospels' account of the temptation of Jesus (e.g., Matt. 4:1–4). After Jesus fasts for forty days, the Devil tempts him to turn stones into bread. Jesus answers with Deuteronomy 8:3 to say that man does not live by bread alone. God tested Israel to show them their dependence upon him; they cannot in their own strength supply a fundamental need of life. They must live by obedience to the will of God. Jesus answers with a correct interpretation of Moses. God tests Jesus as he did Israel to show that Jesus will live by the divine will. Satan also uses the opportunity to tempt Jesus to respond in the way Israel did in the desert. They tested God by demanding he provide water (6:16) because they did not live in trust according to the divine will.

<span id="page-123-6"></span><span id="page-123-3"></span><span id="page-123-2"></span><span id="page-123-0"></span>It is extremely difficult to live faithfully with wealth. The king must not multiply silver and gold (17:17), for God will multiply the silver and gold of Israel (8:13). The problem with God's good gifts is that Israel will attribute them to themselves because of their pride and will forget the God who brought them out of Egypt (v. 14). A king might have the power to multiply wealth, but the only reason to do so would be pride and self-sufficiency. Thus there must be a prohibition against the king's seeking wealth willfully, for the very act is a betrayal of faith. Seeking wealth for the sake of wealth is to serve mammon and not God. Wealth gained is always a gift from God to be used for him, but this is not readily perceived. "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God" (Matt. 19:24).

### <span id="page-124-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 9:1–24

9"Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to heaven, **<sup>2</sup>** a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?' **3**Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the Lord your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the Lord has promised you.

**<sup>4</sup>** "Do not say in your heart, after the Lord your God has thrust them out before you, 'It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land,' whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out before you. **5**Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

**<sup>6</sup>** "Know, therefore, that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people. **7**Remember and do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord. **8**Even at Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, and the Lord was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you. **9**When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the Lord made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. **10**And the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the Lord had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. **11**And at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. **12**Then the Lord said to me, 'Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.'

**<sup>13</sup>** "Furthermore, the Lord said to me, 'I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stubborn people. **14**Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.' **<sup>15</sup>** So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. **16**And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God. You had made yourselves a golden*<sup>1</sup>* calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you. **<sup>17</sup>** So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes. **18**Then I lay prostrate before the Lord as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger. **<sup>19</sup>**For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the Lord bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me that time also. **20**And the Lord was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. **21**Then I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust.

#### *Section Overview: Not in Your Own Righteousness*

The fundamental reason Canaanite culture and the prosperity of the Promised Land are a danger to Israel is the Israelites' faulty self-assessment. They assume this bounty has come to them through their own merit. A new generation falsely thinks it is advanced and progressive, that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. There are always perceived reasons to justify this assertion. Conquest of the great city-states of Canaan could readily lead Israel into false confidence. This circumstance is not different from the deliverance from Egypt, a nation even greater than any of the cities of Canaan. Moses goes back to Mount Sinai to show how quickly such victories become occasions of divine judgment because the fear of the Lord is forgotten.

<span id="page-125-5"></span><span id="page-125-4"></span><span id="page-125-3"></span><span id="page-125-1"></span>The golden calf at Mount Sinai is the outstanding example of rebelliousness. Following a warning to a "stubborn people" (Deut. 9:6), Moses commands them to remember how they "provoked the Lord" (v. 7). Moses then relates events of Exodus 32–34, both the breaking of the covenant (Deut. 9:7–24) and the grace of God in restoration and renewal (9:25–10:11). Exodus tells of Moses' seclusion on the mountain for forty days and nights when the Ten Words were first given (Ex. 24:18), then a second forty days and nights following the breaking of the covenant and the tablets of stone (Ex. 34:28). In Exodus, the account of the golden calf at Mount Sinai separates the instructions for the building of the tabernacle from their implementation. The literary structure suggests that the apostasy of the people interfered with the erection of the tent of meeting between God and his people.

<span id="page-125-2"></span><span id="page-125-0"></span>Moses' first absence of forty days while receiving the Ten Words stimulated the making of an image, described as an idol of Yahweh. This prompted the Lord to urge Moses to hurry down the mountain because this outrage was about to lead <span id="page-126-3"></span><span id="page-126-2"></span>to their destruction (Ex. 32:7–10). Before descending, Moses petitioned for mercy on behalf of Israel. His prayer to avert judgment was based on three arguments (vv. 11–13). First, God had redeemed this people in Egypt through a miraculous deliverance. Second, the Egyptians would say it was the purpose of Yahweh to destroy his people in the wilderness. Third, God had promised the land of Canaan to the patriarchs as an eternal inheritance. This prayer is not included in the narration of the events in Deuteronomy, but it seems to be referenced in Deuteronomy 9:18, where Moses speaks of being prostrate before the Lord "as before." Reference to an earlier prayer must be an allusion to the prayer in Exodus before Moses descended from the mountain. The account in Deuteronomy assumes that the story in Exodus is sufficiently known so that hearers would know which prayer is meant.

<span id="page-126-12"></span><span id="page-126-10"></span><span id="page-126-9"></span><span id="page-126-8"></span>9:1–6 The final hortatory section opens with the initial command of the Shema (Deut. 6:4–5; 9:1). This summons is found five times, all in Deuteronomy and first at 5:1, where it introduces the Decalogue. It will be repeated in the instructions for war when Israel enters the land (20:3) and in the ceremonies marking entrance into the land (27:9). The final warning of the prologue to the instruction of this law begins with an echo of the Shema. Israel must love God as the one who has created them to be his people and is giving them the land.

<span id="page-126-13"></span><span id="page-126-7"></span><span id="page-126-6"></span><span id="page-126-5"></span><span id="page-126-4"></span><span id="page-126-1"></span><span id="page-126-0"></span>The God of Israel is "a consuming fire, a jealous God" (4:24). This must be interpreted as zeal through which God is impassioned to act on behalf of his people. The mighty inhabitants of Canaan, known as the "sons of the Anakim," will not be able to stand before Israel (cf. 1:28). Victory over such forces must not lead to Israel's thinking that she is more righteous than the wicked Canaanites now under judgment (v. 4). The danger is so eminent that the warning must be repeated: it is "not because of your righteousness" (v. 5). Moses also repeats the cause: "because of the wickedness of these nations." In these references the conquest of Canaan is presented in judicial terms. The conquest of Canaan is not a question of who is right and who is wrong; the Canaanites are indeed guilty and are being punished accordingly (cf. Gen. 15:16), but this does not imply Israel is innocent. The second reference recalls fully the reason for the conquest. It is a fulfillment of the promise to Abraham: "To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates" (Gen. 15:18). Entrance into the land is an execution of

<span id="page-127-6"></span>the oath God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. All that can be said of Israel is that they are a stiff-necked people (Deut. 9:6). A zealous God acts on behalf of Israel, but he tolerates no rivals. He is also a consuming fire against Israel.

<span id="page-127-7"></span>9:7–12 The need to fear the Lord begins with a double imperative: "Remember and do not forget." The generation in Moab had not seen the mountain burning with fire, where Moses spent forty days in fasting while receiving the words of the covenant written on tablets of stone. There is no need to recall the details of the image plated with melted gold or the way it was worshiped. The very idea that a holy God could somehow be represented by a manufactured image is an outrage. Fire frequently represents the holiness of God, his absolute separation from the common. Such a God commands trust and fear, two aspects of the same dependence. Israel did not fear God, not even in the presence of the fire on the mountain.

<span id="page-127-9"></span><span id="page-127-8"></span><span id="page-127-2"></span>9:13–15 Moses recalls the words of God while he was still on the mountain (v. 14; cf. Ex. 32:10). "Let me alone" anticipates the intervention of Moses, as is fitting for a prophet whose function is intercession for the weak. An opening is created by which appeal may be made to the mercy of God, providing an opportunity for repentance and mitigation of judgment against sin.

<span id="page-127-10"></span>9:16–17 In a very deliberate and dramatic act, Moses "took hold of the two tablets and threw them . . . and broke them." In recalling the incident, Moses stipulates clearly that the tablets of the covenant were shattered to show how the covenant was broken even as it was being revealed. Destruction of the covenant document immediately renders the covenant void.

<span id="page-127-15"></span><span id="page-127-14"></span><span id="page-127-12"></span><span id="page-127-4"></span><span id="page-127-3"></span>9:18–21 This is the second of three references to forty days and nights during which Moses prayed for the people. Deuteronomy 9:25–29 reveals the content of his prayer, and 10:10–11 reports God's favorable response to his prayers. This prayer is located between the shattering of the tablets and the destruction of the idol, but the reference to forty days is not meant to indicate that more than a month elapsed between these events. Exodus tells us of three occasions on which Moses prayed. The first was while he was on the mountain (Ex. 32:11–14), the second after the destruction of the calf and the execution of the guilty (Ex. 32:30–32), and the third when the tablets were written again (Ex. 34:9). The events described in Deuteronomy parallel those in Exodus, though Deuteronomy omits many details. Moses here prayed "as before" (Deut. 9:18), indicating that the forty days of fasting refer to the time he was on the mountain receiving the words of the covenant. The Lord heard Moses at "that time also" (v. 19), again indicating that this prayer is like that of the earlier prayer on the mountain.

<span id="page-127-13"></span><span id="page-127-11"></span><span id="page-127-5"></span><span id="page-127-1"></span><span id="page-127-0"></span>The Exodus narrative suggests that Aaron was self-deceived in the making of a calf. Although a calf was used to represent both Egyptian and Canaanite gods, Aaron did not intend it for any of those gods, since he proclaimed a festival in honor of Yahweh (Ex. 32:5–6). It seems the people wanted some representation of Yahweh's guidance since they did not know what had become of Moses (Ex. 32:1). Perhaps the

<span id="page-128-1"></span>calf was intended as the pedestal for the invisible presence of Yahweh, much as the cherubs, which were to be constructed for the Most Holy Place to represent a throne (Ex. 25:18–22). Since Moses had not yet descended from the mountain, it may be inferred that Aaron was not aware of these instructions for the representation of the invisible God in the darkness behind the veil. Nevertheless, Aaron was fully culpable for his actions but also received mercy through the intervening prayer of Moses.

The destruction of the idol through burning and grinding indicates that it was a wooden object supported and engraved with metal. The procedure for obliteration was well known in Canaanite culture. Ugaritic texts tell of the termination of a Canaanite god of death called Mot by his adversary Anat: "With a knife she split him, with a sieve she scattered him, with fire she burnt him . . . in the field she sowed him. The birds did eat his flesh, the fowl did consume his limbs."34 In Exodus 32:20 the people are made to drink the water with the dust of the idol, which might be a trial by ordeal to determine the guilty, much like the trial of a suspected adulteress in Numbers 5:12–28. Deuteronomy makes no mention of such a test. The purpose of the whole procedure is to bring about complete demolition that leaves no trace.

<span id="page-128-9"></span><span id="page-128-4"></span><span id="page-128-3"></span><span id="page-128-2"></span><span id="page-128-0"></span>9:22–24 The places of rebellion named in these verses are the first stops of the Israelites following their deliverance from Egypt. Massah was the last stop before arriving at Sinai and was where the people had no water (Ex. 17:1–7). The Taberah and Kibroth-hattaavah incidents took place immediately after leaving Mount Sinai, and they were where the people complained until fire broke out (Num. 11:1–3) and where they lusted for meat (Num. 11:4–15). No journey is indicated between these events; it may be that both happened at the same location. From Mount Sinai the people journeyed to Kadesh-barnea, where they refused to enter the Promised Land (Num. 13:32–14:4), and so that generation died in the wilderness. Rebellion for the Israelites was not incidental but characterized them on each step after they left Egypt.

<span id="page-128-10"></span><span id="page-128-8"></span><span id="page-128-6"></span>This part of the speech concludes with the summary that Israel has been "rebellious against the Lord" from the time he first knew them (Deut. 9:24). The rebellion at Mount Sinai was just one of five that are named (vv. 22–23). It was a journey of eleven days from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by the Mount Seir route (1:2). Within the time of a journey that should have been about two weeks, Israel had rebelled these five times, extending their wanderings forty years. The prologue of the second speech, the law that Moses set before the people (4:44). concludes with the theme of dangers to faith. The generation entering the Promised Land must not be presumptuous. They are not different than their fathers.

<span id="page-128-7"></span>The concluding exhortation of this prologue is descriptive of all humanity and every society, warning against the reason for the worst of suffering and injustice in

every civilization. Most disturbing is the record of self-deception as demonstrated by Moses. The generation oppressed in Egypt, crying for deliverance, immediately considers itself worthy of the redemption received and assumes its self-sufficiency. When God tests them to show that they do not live by bread alone, their response is to test God because of their own weakness. They seem incapable of simply trusting God for the life they themselves cannot support. Modernism has worsened this situation with the development of what is called "enlightenment." Assertions of human autonomy deny any willingness to trust anything outside of humanity itself for the life it cannot give or sustain. Postmodernism is an acknowledgment that no philosophy of history can authenticate itself, but this has done nothing to generate even a modicum of humility. Twenty-first-century North Americans think greatness is more self-esteem, more self-confidence, more self-assurance. This is a pitiful testimony of self-deception, a denial not only of human impotence in solving problems but of culpability for the consequences of hubris and greed. Modern society has proven on a grander scale than ever before the truth of the words Moses speaks here to Israel.

### <span id="page-129-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 9:25–10:11

**<sup>25</sup>** "So I lay prostrate before the Lord for these forty days and forty nights, because the Lord had said he would destroy you. **26**And I prayed to the Lord, 'O Lord God, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. **27**Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin, **<sup>28</sup>** lest the land from which you brought us say, "Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness." **29**For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.'

10"At that time the Lord said to me, 'Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood. **2**And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.' **<sup>3</sup>** So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. **4**And he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments*<sup>1</sup>* that the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. **5**Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark that I had made. And there they are, as the Lord commanded me."

**<sup>6</sup>** (The people of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan*<sup>2</sup>* to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place. **7**From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water. **8**At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord to stand before the Lord to minister to him and to bless in his name, to this day. **9**Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers.

#### *Section Overview: Intercession and Restoration*

<span id="page-130-1"></span>The topic of this section is the restoration of the covenant relationship through the intercession of Moses. The section begins with the prayer of Moses to restore the people (Deut. 9:25–29) and concludes with the result of his petition (10:10–11). God commanded him to resume his march at the head of the people to bring them to the land he had sworn to give to their fathers.

<span id="page-130-2"></span>Various items relating to the restoration are taken up between the two reports of the prayer. The tablets with the Ten Words needed to be replaced, since they detailed the basic responsibilities of the covenant relationship and were the permanent written record. Moses fashioned these and built a receptacle for them. We also read a report on the replacement of Aaron as priest (10:6–7). Since Aaron was implicated in the great transgression, a note is included on his succession. This report is chronologically out of place, since Aaron does not die until Israel is about to enter the Promised Land about forty years later. Aaron's death is incorporated as part of a travel report adopted from another source. This is indicated by the fact that Moses' direct address is suspended and Israel is referenced in the third person. The text also includes a report on the function of the Levites (10:8–9), who had distinguished themselves as not being among the transgressors and thus were the ones to carry out the execution of the guilty (Ex. 32:26–29). Moses dedicated them to the Lord for their extraordinary assignment and declared that they would be blessed. Here it is explained that the Levites would be delegated the sacred task of transporting the covenant symbols and serving in the tabernacle rituals.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-131-8"></span><span id="page-131-7"></span><span id="page-131-2"></span>9:25–29 Forty days and nights recalls Moses' intercession before he descended the mountain, mentioned previously in Deuteronomy 9:18–19 (cf. Ex. 32:9–14). Following the destruction of the calf, Moses pleads for the people of Israel because they are God's creation, redeemed from Egypt in mighty acts. They are God's inheritance, a powerful image that draws on the analogy of land that belongs to a family perpetually. This comparison is repeated from Deuteronomy 4:20, where it was stated that God brought Israel out of the fiery furnace of Egypt to be his own. God has a personal attachment to this people; they are the object of his work. This seems to be the main argument in the prayer, as it is repeated at the end in 9:29. The second argument of the prayer is that God must remember his vow to the ancestors of Israel (v. 27); the present wickedness of the people must not prevent the fulfillment of that purpose. This argument is found also in Exodus 32:13, in the prayer while Moses was on the mountain.

<span id="page-131-10"></span><span id="page-131-9"></span><span id="page-131-4"></span><span id="page-131-3"></span><span id="page-131-0"></span>The third argument concerns God's reputation among the nations. In Exodus 32:12 this is expressed as the Egyptians' assuming that God's purposes for Israel were malevolent, that he intended to destroy them. Pharaoh had thrown out the challenge, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?" (Ex. 5:2). He could not contend with God's might, but Pharaoh could claim that Yahweh's purpose was not to save Israel and that Israel should have remained in Egypt. In this passage Moses adds the further possibility that the nations would believe Yahweh to be unable to save his people. The petition of Moses for mercy after the rebellion at Kadesh-barnea is also based on the nations' saying that God was unable to bring his people to the land (Num. 14:15–16). In the perspective of the nations, God either *could* not save Israel or *would* not. On the other hand, they could also have argued that God knew he could not save Israel but brought them out to die because he had rejected them. In either case the purpose and person of God would be maligned. This prayer is based solely on the character and reputation of God. None of the petitions suggests any virtue of the Israelites that justifies their being forgiven. It is a prayer for mercy, pure and simple.

<span id="page-131-11"></span><span id="page-131-6"></span><span id="page-131-5"></span><span id="page-131-1"></span>10:1–5 The answer to the prayer comes when Moses is commanded to shape two tablets like the ones that were shattered. God would reestablish the covenant with Israel in the words written on the covenant document just as they were originally. The first time the tablets were made by God himself (Ex. 32:16). This may be a figurative way of saying that they came into being by the divine will, like creation. The Ten Words are as much a part of the order of creation as is the regularity of nature. The container mentioned here for the tablets must have been temporary since the ark would be built by Bezalel and Oholiab, craftsmen empowered by God for the artistic designs of the articles of the tabernacle (Ex. 31:1–2, 6–11). The ark

<span id="page-132-1"></span><span id="page-132-0"></span>in the tabernacle was also accompanied by giant cherubim attached to an atonement cover (Hb. *kapporet*, "mercy seat"; Ex. 25:17) resting atop the ark. This gold covering was the place where cleansing for sin would be made (Ex. 25:10–22). This was the meeting place of the covenant.

The chest made by Moses may be understood as a container used to protect contractual documents that were a record of an agreement. Such chests were often deposited in temples, since agreements were usually sponsored by a deity. The ark in the tabernacle would follow this analogy, with the distinction that there was no image in the tabernacle. Testimony to the holiness of God was given by both the ark and the symbols of a royal throne separated from the common by a veil. The covenant that established a relationship between God and his people included a sacred element; the atonement cover above the covenant document provided for the possibility of a relationship. The ark therefore was a representation of the rule and provision of God for his people, unlike the calf made by Aaron and the people.

<span id="page-132-7"></span><span id="page-132-5"></span><span id="page-132-4"></span>10:6–7 The itinerary, which includes the place where Aaron dies, follows that of Numbers 33:30–35, with a slight variation of names and a different order of encampments. These encampments were in the area of Ezion-geber on the east shore of the Gulf of Elath. Aaron died at Moserah, which is named first in the Numbers itinerary. In that list of encampments Aaron dies at Mount Hor, six stations later than Moserah (Num. 33:38). The locations of these encampments and the relationships that may have existed between them cannot be determined. Eleazar son of Aaron is made priest in his place in a public event known to all (Num. 20:22–29). The point of relevance in Deuteronomy is that Aaron, like Moses, does not enter the Promised Land.

<span id="page-132-8"></span><span id="page-132-3"></span><span id="page-132-2"></span>10:8–9 The consecration of the Levites as the ones responsible for the ark develops their role in distinguishing themselves as loyal followers of Yahweh (Ex. 32:26–29). Priesthood is their reward for having stood in battle against illegitimate worship. They become the ministers of legitimate worship perpetually, with a distinguished role: "to stand before the Lord," that is, offer sacrifices on behalf of the people and pronounce the priestly benediction. Their special tasks require them to be dispersed throughout the land, with no territory of their own.

<span id="page-132-9"></span>10:10–11 Moses concludes with the assurance that his prayers for mercy have been answered. Not only has the covenant been restored but Israel will be allowed to enter the land in accordance with the oath made with the patriarchs.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-132-11"></span>The memory of Israel concerning these events is found in the Psalms. The fourth book of the psalter, Psalms 90–106, focuses on the exodus.35 This section of the psalter follows the plea for mercy amid the seeming delay of God's eternal covenant with David (Ps. 89:1–4). The psalter shifts focus from David to the covenant

<span id="page-132-10"></span><span id="page-132-6"></span><sup>35</sup> Cf. Response section on 3:1–29. Psalm 90 is a prayer of Moses.

<span id="page-133-7"></span>with Israel mediated through Moses. The covenant at Sinai is the basis for the rule of God over the whole earth (Psalms 93–100), as it is the establishment of the promise to Abraham through whom all the families of the earth may receive a blessing (Gen. 12:3; Ex. 6:2–8). Earth will come to realize the beauty for which it was created (Psalm 104) only through the mercy of God.

<span id="page-133-18"></span><span id="page-133-17"></span><span id="page-133-14"></span><span id="page-133-13"></span><span id="page-133-11"></span><span id="page-133-10"></span><span id="page-133-9"></span><span id="page-133-8"></span><span id="page-133-0"></span>The maintenance of this covenant is possible only through forgiveness of the covenant people. Psalm 103 is an expression of praise to God as the one who forgives sins and heals diseases (Ps. 103:3). The disease referred to is their sin (cf. Isa. 1:4–6; 6:10). Forgiveness is the most notable benefit that God provides his people (Ps. 103:2), because apart from mercy they could not be a people at all. The disease of humanity is its self-assertiveness in defiance of God, as explained by Isaiah in the introduction to his prophecy (Isa. 1:2–8). The healing of such pernicious illness is the mercy of God that is everlasting to those who fear him and keep his covenant (Ps. 103:17–18). This was made known when God showed his ways to Moses (Ps. 103:7). The specific event the psalmist has in mind is the experience of the golden calf, as is clear in the next line: "The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love" (Ps. 103:8). This line is a direct reference to the lesson of the golden calf found in Exodus 33:19 and 34:5–6. The merciful character of God is the meaning to be associated with his name. In both references the significance of the name Yahweh ("the Lord") is defined as God's being merciful in character. The name Yahweh is related to the verb for being (it translates as "he is" or "he will be"). In Exodus 3 the sense is "I am with you." In Exodus 33–34 the sense is "I am merciful." Each of these is related to the other. It is possible for God to be with Israel only if he is merciful, which is what the sin of the golden calf illustrates. It is God's mercy and his love for Israel that moves God to be present with them through the covenant even when they rebel.

The prayer of Moses in Psalm 90 ends with a plea for mercy: "Return, O Lord! How long? Have pity on your servants" (Ps. 90:13). Individually and collectively, mankind is in need of God's mercy. The reason for the plea is found at the end of the third book of the psalter, with the plea to remember the promise to David (Ps. 89:49–51). The covenant of Sinai assures that the promise of the kingdom will be fulfilled. The earth will be a marvelous home for humans (Psalm 104). Although Israel sinned and acted perversely (Ps. 106:6), God remembered his covenant according to the abundance of his mercy (Ps. 106:45–46). The redemption of the exodus is the assurance of mercy in the distresses and failures of later times.

**<sup>12</sup>** "And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, **<sup>13</sup>** and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today for your good? **14**Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. **15**Yet the Lord set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. **16**Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn. **17**For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. **18**He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. **19**Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. **20**You shall fear the Lord your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear. **21**He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. **22**Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven."

#### *Section Overview: The Supreme God*

<span id="page-134-0"></span>The prologue comes full circle to its starting point in the Shema with its demand for love. Moses is the spokesman of Yahweh, urging Israel "to fear the Lord your God, . . . to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul" (Deut. 10:12). This is the only time that the imperatives to love and to fear the Lord are brought together in the same sentence. These are not sentimental desires but require concrete manifestation in conduct to "walk in all his ways" (10:12). Love is the commitment of the covenant relationship, but fear must be Israel's response to the person of Yahweh. The previous exhortation has established why Israel must fear Yahweh and why they should love him.

This passage does not use the word *holy*, but this is nevertheless the concept developed. *Holiness* is the term used to describe the person of God, who is separate from all material elements. The God of Israel brings into existence the heavens in their uttermost reaches, which in turn sustain life created on earth. Yet this God is very present in heaven and earth, represented uniquely by man (Hb. *ʾadam*) made as his image on earth (*ʾadamah*). Such representation brings a moral dimension to holiness, since the Creator determines what relationships shall exist between those who represent him. In his concluding exhortation Moses addresses both the metaphysical and the ethical dimensions of the holiness of God.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-135-2"></span>10:12–14 The uniqueness of this declaration made about Yahweh is rarely acknowledged. The God of Israel is holy. He exists entirely outside the order of the visible and known world of the common but is completely in control of the heavens and the earth, everywhere present within it. It is not possible to conceive of such a concept having evolved in any ancient period, though such facile assertions have often been made. Most such claims revolve around a revolutionary period in Late Bronze Age Egypt initiated by a pharaoh of the mid-fourteenth century named Amenhotep IV. He declared Aten, the solar disk with its life-giving illumination, to be the sole ruling deity. The king changed his name to Akhenaten as the only son of Aten (Egyptian pharaohs were deemed gods). To empower this deity above all other gods, Akhenaten moved the temple to a new capital called Akhetaten ("the horizon of the Aten"), modern day Tell el-Amarna.

Freud is one prominent figure who argued that Moses was an Egyptian priest of Aten whose followers joined a monotheistic tribe in Midian. His *Moses and Monotheism* used psychoanalytic theory to generate a hypothesis concerning historical events. Freud did acknowledge the Israelite distinction of an invisible god, but this passage in Deuteronomy makes a much more radical distinction. Yahweh is not one god above all others; he is *the* God, not to be associated in any way with material elements such as the sun. In other ancient religions the physical elements were extensions of the gods. In Mesopotamia all was subordinated to the cosmic, unalterable, and impersonal law called *kittum*. 36 The God of Moses rules over all because he is creator of all. Such a concept cannot be an evolution from the surrounding culture, as it is much too radically different.

<span id="page-135-4"></span><span id="page-135-3"></span>10:15–16 Given this description of God, the astonishing truth is that God created Israel as a people of distinction. Verse 15 begins with this surprise (Hb. *raq*, "yet"). Despite all that is true of God, he chose to love Israel and give them a peculiarity above all other peoples in making him known.

<span id="page-135-5"></span><span id="page-135-0"></span>The mention of the fathers is the background to the graphic metonymy of verse 16: the sign of the covenant is named for the covenant itself. Circumcision is the sign of God's covenant with Abraham in Genesis 17:9–11: "This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised" (Gen. 17:10). In Deuteronomy this is cryptically

<span id="page-135-1"></span><sup>36</sup> For an explanation of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian views of humanity and history in relation to the gods cf. E. A. Speiser, "The Biblical Idea of History in Its Common Near Eastern Setting," in *The Jewish Expression*, ed. Judah Goldin (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1976) 1–17.

<span id="page-136-2"></span>stated as "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart" (Deut. 10:16). The sign performed as a public confession must correspond to the commitment of mind to observe all the commands of the covenant. The sign is nothing apart from this reality. Circumcision and stubborn rebellion are a grotesque combination that mocks the confession made in the sign.

<span id="page-136-3"></span>10:17–19 The omnipotence of an awesome God is manifested in his character, which treats all created persons equally. Bribery and favoritism are particularly offensive violations of respect toward humans. Although God has loved Israel to make them a covenant people, a kingdom of priests to represent him, Israel must expect no special favors from God. As they know, God's judgment is as harsh for them as for any others. God has also given other nations land (32:8), so Israel must be careful to treat all others with the same respect. They must not be guilty of the sins the Egyptians committed against them.

<span id="page-136-7"></span><span id="page-136-5"></span>Justice in Scripture is always defined according to covenant requirements. Care for the most vulnerable of the community is the standard measure for keeping the covenant. Isaiah's call to repentance is to learn to do good by seeking justice, especially for the orphan and the widow (Isa. 1:16–17). Widows and orphans are easily marginalized to the periphery of family support, but they are very much a part of God's family. Another that is socially on the margins is the sojourner (Hb. *ger*), who does not own land but lives among the people. Most of these would be Canaanites employed by Israelites. As a day laborer, the *ger* was vulnerable without a stable income. The *ger* is to be not only protected but given provisions. Israel—of all people!—should know of this importance, having been such laborers in Egypt. Covenant responsibility requires care for all, with special attention to those that might be readily neglected.

<span id="page-136-4"></span><span id="page-136-1"></span>10:20–22 Taking an oath in the name of God is an expression of covenant loyalty, as stated in 6:13–14. A false oath shows contempt for God because the oath taker assumes there is no punishment for violation of the word spoken. An oath is taken when affirming the covenant, as done exuberantly in the renewal of Asa (2 Chron. 15:14–15). Those who fear God will serve him, cling to him, and swear by his name without fear.

<span id="page-136-6"></span><span id="page-136-0"></span>The multiplication of Israel is the sign of God's fulfillment of the oath he took with the patriarchs (Gen. 15:5). The miraculous growth of Israel was a work of God alone; there could be no human contribution to this feat, just as God had shown in fulfilling his promise to Abraham. According to the census in Numbers, Israel numbered six hundred thousand males of military age at the time of the exodus. This declaration of God's great work transitions abruptly to a second exhortation to love God, which details further the great things he has done.

#### *Response*

The irrational assumption of atheism is that humans have the power to discern all that can be known by perception of their senses as analyzed by their mind. Only

rationalism and empiricism are acceptable; revelation is arbitrarily excluded as a possibility. Immediate suspicion of this assumption should be raised with the acknowledgment that the human mind and empirical observation cannot even contrive a theory for the emergence of life from inanimate chemicals. On earth, life seems to spring up irrepressibly when all the forces of death are arrayed against it. Origins of life are pushed back ever further in the mysteries of time, or even off to some other planet, but this does nothing to answer the problem of what Michael Behe has called "Darwin's black box."37 "Black box" is his metaphor for a process not understood that obviously takes place. Evolution must include a process whereby life arose from nonliving matter and developed entirely by impersonal means observable to human perception. The words of Klaus Dose, researching molecular chemistry in 1988, have become ever more true today:

More than 30 years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principal theories and experiments in the field either end in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance.38

It might be argued that, one day, science will do more than discovering increasing complexity, but this still would not answer the assertion that humans have access to all possible knowledge through their own mental powers. The Hebrew concept of a holy God is one that cannot be perceived or discovered by humans independently. The Hebrew God belongs to a dimension called *holiness*. This order is outside the chemistry of the common but is responsible for creating it. Thus Moses speaks of the God of gods and Lord of lords. All other beings, some called gods, are derivative of the common order. The God of Moses can be known only through his self-revelation, which is the claim Moses makes in these verses. That revelation is rational and reasonable. Israel had seen and heard that which no one could possibly discover by human ingenuity. But this God should also be loved, the only acceptable response of everything that Israel has experienced.

Another irrational characteristic of humans is their refusal to live by what they know. Sometimes this is a matter of defiance, sometimes indifference, and sometimes simple lack of discipline. Thus Moses calls for a circumcised heart. It is one thing to admit something is rational, but quite another to live in accordance with such knowledge. Israel might believe and follow through on the covenant oath, taking the sign of circumcision, but they might not have the love demanded by God. They must live in accordance with the way of life laid out before them. Fear and love for God is nothing less than following in his ways. It must never be reduced to mere belief.

Fundamental to following in God's ways is the recognition that no human has exclusive privileges or rights limited to a certain status. Even the king must live

<sup>37</sup> Michael J. Behe, *Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution* (New York: Free Press, 1996).

according to the values of the covenant. Life is a gift, given equally to all, whatever one's fortunes within society. The privileges of life must be ensured for all the living. Israel has a special calling to represent the Creator. The most fundamental way they do so is by showing utmost respect for all life given by their Creator, knowing that he cares no less for the person of low society than for one of privilege.

11 "You shall therefore love the Lord your God and keep his charge, his statutes, his rules, and his commandments always. **2**And consider today (since I am not speaking to your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline*<sup>1</sup>* of the Lord your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm, **3**his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land, **<sup>4</sup>** and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the Lord has destroyed them to this day, **<sup>5</sup>** and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place, **<sup>6</sup>** and what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel. **7**For your eyes have seen all the great work of the Lord that he did.

**<sup>8</sup>** "You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess, **<sup>9</sup>** and that you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey. **10**For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it,*<sup>2</sup>* like a garden of vegetables. **11**But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven, **<sup>12</sup>** a land that the Lord your God cares for. The eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

**<sup>13</sup>** "And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, **14**he*<sup>3</sup>* will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil. **15**And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. **16**Take care lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them; **<sup>17</sup>** then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and you will perish quickly off the good land that the Lord is giving you."

#### *Section Overview: God of Power*

<span id="page-139-6"></span><span id="page-139-4"></span>Moses reminds Israel of her experience with the power of God, which demands a response of fear and love. The children did not see this encounter with the power of God (Deut. 11:2), but the elders have seen all the deeds that God has done (vv. 3, 7). These are the lessons of forty years that are to teach Israel the fear of the Lord. Verses 2–7 are one long sentence that begins with "consider today" and continues with a series of clauses concerning "what he did." This develops the conclusion of the last chapter: "He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen" (10:21). Israel is to consider the "discipline of the Lord" because this is her wisdom and understanding before all peoples, who will say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people" (4:6). Discipline (Hb. *musar*) is the means by which God brings wisdom (Prov. 3:11–12; 4:13). To live out wisdom means to "keep his charge" (Deut. 11:1) and the "whole commandment" (v. 8), namely, everything Moses is instructing in this law.

<span id="page-139-8"></span><span id="page-139-7"></span><span id="page-139-3"></span><span id="page-139-2"></span><span id="page-139-0"></span>To keep the whole commandment is to "love the Lord your God" and to serve him in every thought with complete devotion (11:13), the words of commitment declared in the Shema. Obedience to the covenant demand comes with the promise of long life in a land unlike Egypt, a land in which God provides rain from the heavens that generates an abundance in the hills and valleys. Since the religions of Canaan were all about prosperity, Israel must remember that God is their only source of life and that such life comes with an abundance they never knew in Egypt.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-139-1"></span>11:1 The demand to love God is now reinforced by the reminder of what Israel has learned of God in its experience since leaving Egypt. This verse is a conclusion to the command to fear and love God in 10:12, which is repeated in verse 20. It is also the introduction of the theme of God's deeds for Israel, which otherwise begins abruptly.

<span id="page-139-5"></span>11:2–7 Syntactically, it is challenging to determine the object of the imperative "consider." The NJPS renders it this way: "Take thought this day that it was not your children, who neither experienced nor witnessed the lesson of the Lord your God—," with the list of deeds then simply listed as examples. The ESV makes the children parenthetic, with the object being the list of deeds. Consideration of the list of deeds done and the need to teach the next generation are equally important. It is impossible to say that one should be subordinated to the other; the ambiguity may be a way of making both equal. The list of deeds shows why it is necessary to love God, but a love for God learned through these deeds makes more urgent the imperative to teach the children, since these lessons can be learned only through the enactment of the confessions that follow. These words must be bound "as a sign" on the hands, and the people will need to take the oath of a "a blessing and a curse" (vv. 18, 26). Consideration of the children anticipates the sequel of what is necessary as Israel enters the Promised Land.

<span id="page-140-10"></span><span id="page-140-7"></span>The lessons of the sequel all deal with the consequences of rebellion against God. The lesson to be taught may appropriately be described as a "discipline" (v. 2), the primary lesson being the human propensity to rebel against the love of God as something restrictive. This is true not only for the Egyptians but equally so for Israel, as is shown in the lessons from the past. Israel witnessed the judgment of God against Pharaoh and his armies, a stupendous event that could be nothing less than the actions of the Creator. The Red Sea flowing back over the Egyptian armies defies natural explanation; this event was remembered as the sea covering the enemies of Israel in Psalm 78:53. Pharaoh had defiantly asked, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice . . . ?" (Ex. 5:2). The last of the plagues had only temporarily brought him to submission. The judgment of the Red Sea ended the power of Egypt "to this day" (Deut. 11:4). No one present could deny the truth of this great deed.

<span id="page-140-11"></span><span id="page-140-8"></span><span id="page-140-3"></span><span id="page-140-2"></span><span id="page-140-0"></span>But just as Pharaoh rebelled against God, Israel defied God in refusing to enter the Promised Land and then, in her disillusionment, challenged divinely appointed leadership. Dathan and Abiram, sons of Reuben, firstborn of Jacob, challenged the leadership of Moses over the people (Num. 16:1–2). In Numbers this story is told together with that of a rebellion against Aaron of Levites who claimed his clan did not have exclusive right to the priesthood (Num. 16:3). Deuteronomy refers only to the civil rebellion against Moses, which may be analogous to the hubris of Pharaoh. A special punishment was designated for Dathan and Abiram because they refused to leave their tents at the command of Moses (Num. 16:12–15). Their punishment was unprecedented in that they literally went alive into their graves with all their families and possessions (Num. 16:25–34). No one was to go near them since they were subject to the *kherem*, a designation by which they were set apart exclusively to God and would no longer live in the common world. Just as it would be fatal for the people to come too close to Mount Sinai when God appeared there (Ex. 19:12), so touching anything that belonged to the rebels could be fatal.

<span id="page-140-9"></span><span id="page-140-6"></span><span id="page-140-5"></span><span id="page-140-4"></span><span id="page-140-1"></span>11:8–9 The lessons of Egypt and the wilderness enforce the requirement that Israel must keep the "whole commandment," all the Torah that Moses is setting before them. This verse concludes these lessons introduced by the demand to love God and "keep his charge" (Deut. 11:1). Love for God in keeping the whole commandment will ensure both possession of the land and a long life there. This leads Moses to a description of the land, which is not at all like what they experienced in Egypt.

<span id="page-141-3"></span><span id="page-141-2"></span>11:10–12 Love for God in keeping his charge will be necessary for survival in the land Israel is about to enter. Egypt was a land requiring irrigation, a task expressed ambiguously as "watered it with your feet" (11:10 ESV mg.), involving various aspects of diverting water. Agriculture in Egypt depended on the rising of the Nile in summer and fall as a result of melting snow and of rains in Ethiopia. Vegetation in Egypt to the present time is supported by the Nile and systems of irrigation canals and reservoirs, since the levels of the Nile may vary significantly from year to year. It may be debated whether a land that depends on rain is more advantageous for agriculture. The point of this passage is that a land dependent on rain is advantageous to those who observe God's commands. This land makes obvious the need for dependence on God. For the land to yield its abundance, God must continuously watch it, from the first of the year to the last. It is therefore the best of all lands for those who observe the whole command of God

<span id="page-141-0"></span>The sentiment concerning the abundance of the land expressed here is like that already given in 6:10–11; 8:7–9. These passages express how the abundance of the land in terms of houses, vineyards, grain, oil, honey, and abundant water are entirely a gift of God.

<span id="page-141-4"></span>11:13–17 This section concludes with the exhortation to love and serve God, returning to the theme of the importance of complete devotion to relationship with God. The exhortation here comes with the warning implicit in the previous verses. Ironically, the people's temptation will be to follow fertility gods, who went through cycles of power to give rain and death when the land languished. The God of Israel could be relied upon to provide rain in its time. The requirement was faithfulness, lest Israel experience the judgment of the heavens' withholding the rains.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-141-1"></span>Love must be learned, in a lesson that is never complete. Learning to love God as he demands is the process of a lifetime. It requires observance of the whole Torah, everything that God revealed to Moses concerning how life is to be lived. Learning this love is a discipline (11:2) that involves an understanding of all the ways God corrects us, as seen in his deliverance and instruction of Israel. The deliverance from Egypt is a stern reminder of the necessity of learning to fear the Lord. The Egyptians suffered the judgment of their denial of Yahweh. This fear was not learned by those of Israel who rebelled against their divinely appointed leaders and therefore suffered the same kind of judgment. Learning to fear the Lord is, at the same time, instruction to love the Lord. Knowing the Lord, who gives bread for life and whose words are therefore the bread of life, will lead to the devotion demanded in the command to love.

Entering the land of rain and abundance is a means of learning to love God, but it is also a temptation to believe that bread may be earned apart from God. An example of this truth takes place in the days of Ahab during the time of Elijah <span id="page-142-5"></span><span id="page-142-4"></span><span id="page-142-1"></span><span id="page-142-0"></span>(1 Kings 17–18). Elijah represents the power of God to determine the times of rain, as Moses declares (Deut. 11:11–12). Ironically, Ahab blames Elijah for the drought instead of repenting and acknowledging the powerlessness of Baal to provide rain (1 Kings 18:17–18). He does not understand that mortals do not live by bread alone, that God alone grants rain, grain, wine, and oil as his people learn to love him (Deut. 11:13–15). Love for God does not mean there will be no times without rain. God disciplines his children so that they may continue to learn to love him. The love demanded by God is exclusive (v. 16). It requires constant self-discipline, something not learned by Ahab nor by the people of the covenant.

### <span id="page-142-3"></span><span id="page-142-2"></span>DEUTERONOMY 11:18–32

**<sup>18</sup>** "You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. **19**You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. **20**You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, **<sup>21</sup>** that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth. **22**For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the Lord your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him, **<sup>23</sup>** then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you. **24**Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours.

#### *Section Overview: Confessions of Faith*

<span id="page-143-0"></span>The exhortation of this Torah concludes as it began, with the command to keep these words continuously in mind and to make such knowledge one's constant desire. The requirement that these words be bound on the hand and forehead is repeated from 6:6–9, signaling that this portion of the sermon has come to an end. Combatting the danger of forgetting the entire charge given by God requires vigilance, hence the requirement that they be impressed on the mind in such a way that every action may be controlled by them.

<span id="page-143-4"></span><span id="page-143-3"></span><span id="page-143-2"></span>The preamble of this Torah is summed up with a blessing and a curse, typical language of a covenant in the treaties of the Late Bronze Age. The blessings and curses are part of an oath ceremony to be carried out at Shechem, the city between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. Chapter 27 develops and clarifies the covenantal renewal ceremony to take place upon entrance into the land. The enactment of this ceremony is described in Joshua 8:30–35, following the defeat of Jericho and Ai, and again in Joshua 24:1–27, at the conclusion of the account of the conquest and the distribution of the land. Renewal of the covenant for the new generation is the burden of Moses in these closing speeches. It is only appropriate that formal instructions for when this should be done punctuate the key points of the giving of this Torah, first at the end of the prologue and again just before the blessings and the curses that set out the destinies of life and death.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-143-1"></span>11:18–21 The command to bind these words on the wrists, hands, and forehead is slightly different from that given at the introduction to the prologue. The imperative to instruct the next generation is given between the command to bind them on prominent parts of the body and on the house and gate. Binding the words on the body has a significance separate from that of the house and the city, as it is intensely personal. Individuals must show the signs of covenant obedience, especially in actions but perhaps also as symbols on the body. Head ornaments are known in ancient times, but no connection can be made between "frontlets" (Hb. *totaphot*) and such symbols, nor can a historical connection be established with the phylacteries of a later time. It is known, however, that tiny rolls of text were used as amulets for protection. In 1979 two tiny silver scrolls were found in a burial chamber located in Ketef Hinnom ("slope of Hinnom"), near Mount Zion and the old City of David. These scrolls come from the First Temple period;

the larger one is about 4 x 1 inch (10.2 x 2.5 cm), the smaller about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in height. The words on the larger scroll call upon Yahweh, who keeps the covenant to those who love him and keep his commandments. The second scroll is a prayer to be blessed by Yahweh, who rebukes evil. Both conclude with the blessing found in Numbers 6:24–26. These are the oldest actual biblical texts extant.39 The presence of such scrolls may suggest that words such as these were bound to the body.

<span id="page-144-0"></span>The Greek word *phylactery*, used for the later practice of binding the words to the body, is derived from the Greek word for "protection." This is appropriate, as security and protection can be found only in obedience to the whole charge of God. Whether the words were bound to the body metaphorically, in the sense that they were so embedded in mind that they controlled the body, or physically, as a constant mental reminder of the message they contain, the effect is the same. Safety and blessing are to be found in keeping the whole commandment.

<span id="page-144-2"></span><span id="page-144-1"></span>11:22–25 Moses here develops the conclusion given in Deuteronomy 11:8, the first section of the exhortation to listen to God the Most High. Yahweh would give Israel the land controlled by kings that even the mighty power of Egypt could not control. They would lay claim to it by walking through it in conquest. The land is described in terms of the major features that mark Canaan, that is, the extremities of its extent. These are the deserts on the south, Lebanon and Euphrates in the north, and the Mediterranean on the west. Israel is about to cross the Jordan, so implicitly that is the eastern boundary.

<span id="page-144-3"></span>11:26–27 Blessing or curse is a choice immediately present for Israel. All that has been said in the previous exhortation and the prologue is a choice between two futures. Following in the way of gods that Israel has not experienced, those that have not proven themselves in the way that Yahweh has done in bringing them to this place, will result in the curse. Israel has never had a helper outside of the God revealed to them and delivering them. Following any other god is both unbelief and betrayal.

<span id="page-144-4"></span>11:28–30 Public ceremonies are a critical part of instruction, as they dramatize the consequences of obedience and disobedience. The importance of this ceremony to the people about to enter the land may be observed by its repetition in chapter 27. The location of the ceremony is described specifically for those about to enter a land they do not know. Ebal and Gerizim are in the highlands some 30 miles (48 km) to the west of the Jordan valley. The location of Gilgal named here must be a different location than the one across the river where Israel was encamped. The only alternative is to assume that this description has been merged with that of another ceremony which also took place at Gilgal. Chapter 27 seems to indicate that there was more than one ceremony.

<span id="page-145-0"></span>The tree at Shechem called the "oak of Moreh" is first mentioned in Abraham's journey into the land of Canaan in Genesis 12:6. This tree or grove of trees was significant in receiving oracles, or divine instruction, as indicated by its name ("Moreh" = "instruction"). Such sacred sites are widely known in many cultures. Shechem seems to have been particularly noted for its sacred locations. Jacob buried his various idolatrous artifacts there (Gen. 35:4), and Joshua set up a great stone there at the time of the making of the covenant (Josh. 24:26). These events may have all involved the same tree, as large distinguished trees can stand for many centuries. Their endurance increases their distinction.

<span id="page-145-3"></span><span id="page-145-2"></span><span id="page-145-1"></span>11:31–32 These verses are transitional, as they constitute the introduction to the next section of the address, the exposition of this Torah. They do not conclude the instructions for the ceremony, but they do summarize the preceding prologue, which instructs Israel to live in the land across the Jordan. The necessity of keeping all of the rules and regulations that Moses is teaching them turns the focus of the address to the exposition of the entire instruction.

#### *Response*

Ceremony is important for the Christian no less than for the people of Israel. Public confession creates an accountability of commitment important to maintaining fidelity. The covenant Israel was to make on entrance to the Promised Land might be compared the significance of a wedding ceremony to a marriage. The church recognizes a marriage only if there is a commitment made with vows and witnesses known to the congregation. Ideally the congregation is then involved in supporting the marriage and helping the couple. The vow of commitment in the new covenant is baptism. In the same way, the expression of this vow in baptism is a criterion of belonging to a congregation. Those making a faith commitment to redemption in Christ receive baptism to show their unity with him in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–5). As Paul explains, this results in a transformed way of life, putting away former conduct with its vain way of thinking and living in the newness of the way of Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit (e.g., Rom. 8:1–17).

<span id="page-145-7"></span><span id="page-145-6"></span><span id="page-145-5"></span><span id="page-145-4"></span>Baptism as a sign of the new covenant is established by Jesus when he is baptized by John in the Jordan. In this baptism, Jesus shows his identity with those who display their repentance in accepting the baptism of repentance and expressing their desire to be faithful to the covenant. Jesus will declare himself to be the fulfillment of the new covenant at the time of his death: "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20). With Jesus, baptism is given a new significance. It is no longer only a testimony of repentance but a confession of following Jesus, who has brought to us the redemption of the new covenant. For this reason, followers of Jesus make disciples from all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). As with Israel in covenant declaration, baptism is the uncompromised dedication of one's life to Jesus as Lord and Savior.

<span id="page-146-3"></span><span id="page-146-2"></span><span id="page-146-1"></span>Jesus calls his followers to the same love that Moses requires of the children of Israel. "We love because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). Disciples of Jesus are known by the love they have for one another (John 13:35). This love for God is not without failure—the disciple who vows he will lay down his life for Jesus shortly denies him three time (John 13:37–38). Such failure is not the end of the covenant vow; it is a failure common to all humanity. Peter weeps bitterly over his failure, and his life becomes one of the most powerful examples of love for God and others, just as Moses demands of Israel. But a denial of this love in relation to God and others is a denial of discipleship, irrespective of vows that may have been taken. The expression of this love may be found in the requirements of Deuteronomy. Ceremonies and rituals have necessarily changed in the expression of the new covenant, but the requirements in relation to others and God remain the same.

#### *Section Overview: Regulations for Worship*

<span id="page-147-2"></span><span id="page-147-0"></span>The exposition of this Torah extends from 12:1 to 26:19, concluding with the blessings and curses in 28:1–68. Chapter 27 repeats the necessity of covenant <span id="page-148-2"></span>renewal in the Promised Land. The exposition falls into several large sections that sometimes digress or transition into tangential issues, so that determining the subdivisions is to some measure the choice of the reader. The first major section deals with matters of confessing the covenant in worship (12:1–16:17). Related topics include instructions for dealing with syncretism of Canaanite religion, consumption of food ritually pure and eaten in the right place, care for the poor, and observance of the annual festivals. A second major section deals with appointment of civil and religious authorities (16:18–18:22). A third section concerns judicial and military matters as the people move into the Promised Land (19:1–21:9). Family matters and civil issues take up the last section of instruction (21:10–25:19). The whole exposition concludes with a ceremony of praise and fidelity (26:1–19) and the blessings and curses (ch. 28) that are part of the covenant vow.

<span id="page-148-8"></span><span id="page-148-7"></span><span id="page-148-6"></span><span id="page-148-5"></span><span id="page-148-4"></span><span id="page-148-0"></span>The section on worship makes its primary concern the distinctiveness of the covenant God. Israel must know what it means to make the astounding confession that there is no other God (4:35, 39). To say Yahweh is holy makes a statement that he is unlike any other kind of deity worshiped in any other culture. Worship of Israel's God can have no association with those gods that emerge from the order of the common and are ultimately dependent on it. Israelite places of worship, the Israelite manner of worship, and the covenant of Israel with the Giver of life must not be compromised by any association with worship in the common culture. Of course, the language of culture, whether in words or ritual, must be used to express the concepts of Israel's God, but it must never be thought that other gods can contribute to the life of Israel.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-148-3"></span><span id="page-148-1"></span>12:1 The heading introducing the rules and regulations of this Torah continues the transition of the previous chapter that summarized the prologue and directed attention to the instruction Israel had been exhorted to observe. This orientation toward instructions for worship in the Promised Land is concluded in 12:29–31,

in which Israel is exhorted to be separate from the abominations of the people whose land they are about to enter.

<span id="page-149-0"></span>12:2–3 Canaanite gods emerged from the natural world and were dependent upon it; such worship was a contradiction to the Israelite concept of a holy and transcendent God. Therefore, Canaanite places of worship were to be destroyed. These were for the most part not temples but open-air sanctuaries consisting of a raised platform leveled with stones called in Hebrew a *bamah*, often translated "high place." Such places were usually associated with trees called "Asherim" and with an altar, a pillar, and associated artifacts. Gideon was told to cut down the "Ashera," destroy the altar of Baal, and break up the platform (Judg. 6:25–26). All reminders of the existence of these places in the Promised Land were to be eradicated.

<span id="page-149-3"></span><span id="page-149-2"></span>12:4–7 Israel is to distinguish its worship from the Canaanites' by seeking out, from all the tribes, the place God has claimed as exclusive to his presence by placing his name on it. A name on a place is a sign of ownership. This is not to suggest that God is confined to this place or that one place of worship would eliminate false worship. One place of worship appears to be required because using multiple places of worship has unacceptable associations with Canaanite practice: "You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way" (Deut. 12:4). Other features of Canaanite practice, such as altars, sacrifices, and agricultural festivals, are acceptable means of confessing Israelite faith, but the practice of multiple shrines is not.

<span id="page-149-1"></span>Moses envisions the distinctiveness of a single worship center to which Israelites will come from all their places of residence. In practice this will be not possible before David captures Jerusalem and makes it a capital for all the tribes. The elimination of Canaanite places of worship is not undertaken until the time of Hezekiah. Two related assumptions about these realities must be challenged. The first is that the date of Deuteronomy must be associated with the political efforts to centralize worship. The second is that the motivation for a single place of worship is to foster political control, as is the case when Jeroboam sets up altars at Bethel and Dan (1 Kings 12:26–33). Centralization does not necessarily foster unity or political loyalty; the Rabshakeh could accuse Hezekiah of betraying Yahweh because of the destruction of the altars in Judah (2 Kings 18:22). If the prophetic word to Israel found in the Former Prophets (Joshua–2 Kings) is based on the Torah of Moses, similarity in the language will naturally be found. But this does not require the Former Prophets to precede Deuteronomy, as is often claimed.

<span id="page-149-5"></span><span id="page-149-4"></span>Specific acts of worship are to be limited to the one place God will choose. These include the burnt and sacrificial offerings, tithes, contributions, vows, voluntary offerings, and the offering of the firstborn. Worship is not limited, however, to pilgrimages to the central place, for that would allow very limited times of worship. Prayer and other forms of worship are not prohibited at the places people live. However, worship in Israel is to be distinguished by limiting certain corporate worship to one central place. Further, other worship is not to have any association with

<span id="page-150-12"></span>shrines like those used by the Canaanites. Such places of false worship continue to be present in Judah after the building of the temple from the time of Rehoboam (1 Kings 14:23), though Asa and Jehoshaphat make some attempt to control them (2 Chron. 14:3, 5; 17:6). Such worship is condemned under the covenant and is cited by the prophets as the reason God exiles Israel and Judah.

<span id="page-150-13"></span><span id="page-150-11"></span><span id="page-150-6"></span><span id="page-150-4"></span>12:8–12 The place of rest is the land God promised to Abraham (Deut. 3:20). The years of wilderness wanderings have required the people to adapt their worship to their situation. Entrance into the promised inheritance will provide for the peace and security necessary to honor God in his prescribed form of worship. This rest is achieved when the conquest of Joshua is complete (Josh. 21:43–45). Once the people are settled, times of worship at the place of God's choice will become festive occasions for all people, particularly those dependent on others because they have no property. This includes Israelite servants, possibly those who must work off debt incurred against their property (Ex. 21:2–6). Deuteronomy specifically includes Levites among the disadvantaged because they receive no property. Once worship is limited to a centralized location, the Levites will lose their normal sources of livelihood (cf. Deut. 18:1–5). Deuteronomy frequently appeals for the Levites to be included and provides a special tithe for them (14:28–29). Participation in the centralized festivities will partially compensate for former shares of sacrifices and donations.

<span id="page-150-10"></span><span id="page-150-9"></span><span id="page-150-7"></span><span id="page-150-5"></span><span id="page-150-2"></span><span id="page-150-1"></span>12:13–19 These verses clarify the situation of centralized worship. Legitimate sacrifices for worship must not be offered in the wrong place, namely, people's residences. Sacrifices must be offered at the sanctuary, where the blood can be sprinkled on the altar. It is debated whether Leviticus permits domestic animals slaughtered for food to be eaten away from the sanctuary; the question depends on whether the slaughter of an animal in Leviticus 17:1–7 includes those animals used for food or is limited to sacrificial animals. Deuteronomy makes this point clear in the new situation; domestic animals can be slaughtered for food and eaten anywhere (Hb. *zebakh* = "sacrifice," Deut. 12:6, 11; but in v. 15 it clearly means "slaughter"), just as hunted wild animals are. The only stipulation is that the blood cannot be eaten since it represents life, which can be given only by God (Gen. 9:2–4). Leviticus further specifies that when animals are killed the blood must be covered with earth (Lev. 17:13–14). Uncovered blood cries out for vengeance (Job 16:18). Deuteronomy clarifies the sacred aspect of blood; it is poured on the ground like water (Deut. 12:16), that is, blood is not in *itself* sacred but is like water in that it can represent something sacred.

<span id="page-150-14"></span><span id="page-150-8"></span><span id="page-150-3"></span><span id="page-150-0"></span>Domestic animals were used primarily for their products and for labor; only the wealthy could afford them for food. Further, meat could be eaten only when there were enough people to consume all of it so that there would be no spoilage. Consumption was therefore limited to special occasions such as festivals or honored guests. Nonsacrificial meat could be eaten away from the place of worship, and it was not necessary for one to be in a state of ritual purity to consume it. All sacred food, however, such as tithes, vows, voluntary offerings, and gifts, had to be eaten at the central sanctuary, where all people could participate and celebrate.

<span id="page-151-2"></span><span id="page-151-1"></span>12:20–28 When the Israelites come into full possession of their vast territory, it will become impossible from a practical point of view to slaughter meat for food at the central sanctuary. Meat is a desirable delicacy as part of the human diet, and there are times when one may simply have a desire for this rich food. Such a desire can be legitimately fulfilled, but at the same time this must be done with due respect to the life of the animal. The warning about blood is repeated (vv. 23–26). This indicates the seriousness of violating animal life and perhaps is a warning against carelessness. "You shall not eat the life" indicates that care must be taken to ensure the blood is properly removed in the process of slaughter—a key requirement of kosher food today. Neither is the blood to be used in an alternate form of food. A warning to be observant of all the sacrificial regulations concludes this section. The ritual regulations of Deuteronomy are less stringent than those of Leviticus, particularly regarding the avoidance of eating the fat (Lev. 3:17; 7:23, 25), while Deuteronomy especially emphasizes the sincere intentions of the worshiper.

<span id="page-151-6"></span><span id="page-151-5"></span><span id="page-151-3"></span><span id="page-151-0"></span>12:29–31 The Lord is granting the land of Canaan to Israel according to his promise. The danger is that the Israelites themselves might become like the Canaanites. The burning of infants as a dedication, offering one's most valuable gift to the gods, was a Canaanite practice (cf. 2 Kings 3:27). The actions of Ahaz in passing his sons through the fire (2 Chron. 28:3) appear to have been the dedication of a child to a deity through a ceremony involving fire (cf. Deut. 18:10), a practice that was also a Canaanite abomination.

#### <span id="page-151-4"></span>*Response*

This chapter is frank about the reality that Israel will not be an isolated nation. They will be living among the Canaanites with the constant temptation to compromise the way of life in which Moses has instructed them in the giving of the covenant. The chapter also implicitly recognizes the reality of the deception of such a compromise. It will not be perceived as a rejection of the covenant, because the Israelites will forget the exclusive nature of the God they have professed. They will fail to understand the significance of his holiness once they are immersed among the ideologies of other great and powerful peoples.

<span id="page-151-7"></span>The words of Jesus in his prayer for his disciples just before his crucifixion address the same situation as the words of Moses to Israel. In John 17:14–17 Jesus prays,

I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.

<span id="page-152-0"></span>The disciples of Jesus are in the world just as Israel was in Canaan. Fidelity to the covenant depends on the Word of God, and as Moses will say, this Word is not too difficult and is not far away (Deut. 30:11). The difficulty is in carrying out this Word in the midst of a culture that challenges and even hates it.

<span id="page-152-1"></span>In postexilic times the place of worship becomes a highly contested matter, evident in the prominent temple remains on Mount Gerizim to this day. This temple is the reference point of the woman Jesus meets at the well in Samaria, who asks about the proper place of worship (John 4:20). In this text John points to the transformation of the place of worship through the words of Jesus. A physical temple is not vital to worship; knowledge of the one who is worshiped is in fact the key (John 4:23–24). Temples can only represent the presence of a holy God. The temple that Jesus builds is that of his church, where worship must take place (Eph. 2:19–22; 1 Pet. 2:4–5). The gathering of the church is where the Lord places his name—it is his temple.

<span id="page-152-4"></span><span id="page-152-2"></span>The Christian must ever recognize the critical importance of worship at the place where God has placed his name. Gathering to worship the holy God in spirit and in truth is critical to maintaining a distinct presence in the world and living in faithfulness to the covenant. The Christian must never neglect the regularity of coming to worship at the place God has chosen. A second element of the challenge emphasized by Moses is to worship God by caring about the concerns of God. Moses stresses that those concerns begin with the needs of the people of the covenant. When Israel settles into their farms they must not forget the disenfranchised, some of whom are disenfranchised for a special purpose, such as the Levites. Worship of God does not take place apart from the concerns of God. In Chronicles, once David has established the Levitical choirs, it is evident that singing praises in worship is important to the community. Deuteronomy calls attention to what is also essential, namely, caring for all the needs of those who come to the place where God has placed his name.

<span id="page-152-3"></span>Food is always a part of worship, as it is vital to human existence. In Israel a large part of the food at the place of worship is used to care for the poor. Meat is always a serious consideration in food consumption, as it involves taking the life of another living animal. In Israel sacrificial animals must be carefully distinguished from animals used for food, usually wild animals in ancient times. God grants animals as a means for food, but not without the required acknowledgment that humans receive all life as a gift. Blood represents that life and therefore is to be buried in proper recognition of the taking of the life of the animal. In Acts the church determines that this requirement should continue to be observed (Acts 15:20). A strangled animal is not bled and would be particularly offensive in the synagogue context. While this is not given as a permanent moral prohibition, it is a reminder of the importance of cultural considerations in all use of food. It is a further reminder that meat should not be treated as other plant food but that in some way the life of the animal is to be acknowledged. This is probably rarely considered by most Christians in the consumption of food, but there should be an

awareness of the special status of meat. Thought should be given to all the food we consume, with due consideration to the impact our food habits have on the proper worship of God.

#### *Section Overview: Incitement to Worship Other Gods*

The history of the covenant is a long account of the insidious nature of apostasy. The problem is not that apostasy is difficult to recognize. The boundaries of adherence to covenant faith are at times ambiguous, but if a community has a clear focus on the central tenets of the covenant commitment, then the continuously shifting responses to new ideas and questions need not be threatening. Much more problematic is the seduction of affiliation. There is inherent danger in the influence of an individual who has compromised the covenant faith by turning away from complete devotion to the one and only God. Resisting compromise to the covenant may require the breakup of families or communities. Apostate families may lead to the apostasy of whole communities. This is the progression warned against in this chapter.

<span id="page-154-1"></span>The challenge in all cases is to determine "if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done" (13:14). False charges are as insidious as apostasy itself. Sometimes this is simply a matter of uncompromising pride over matters of opinion or, even worse, simple jealousy at the success of another person. But in Israel seduction becomes normal; the materialistic temptation of Baalism is a constant lure. The Baal religion always promises a little more. It can always be rationalized that it does not violate the covenant worship of Yahweh.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-154-0"></span>12:32 In the section divisions of the Masoretic Text this verse is included in the conclusion to the regulations for proper worship, warning against any alteration of the requirement that sacrifice be limited to the place God will choose. However, the chapter divisions in the Masoretic Text and the LXX join this verse to the following

<span id="page-155-4"></span><span id="page-155-0"></span>section. This chapter division makes verse 32 a heading for the judgment against those who might incite sedition, an important literary introduction to the consequences of covenant violation. This warning not to add or take away (cf. 4:2) finds parallels in ancient treaty formulas, where such warnings serve to guard against any person who might change the stipulations of the oath that has been taken.

The lure of a materialistic Baal culture is a constant threat against loyalty to the covenant God. In Israel many voices would claim to have the power to bring the wealth of the Baal cult.

<span id="page-155-5"></span><span id="page-155-3"></span><span id="page-155-2"></span>13:1–5 Prophets, those who interpret dreams (oneiromancers) or produce evidence of signs, as Moses did before Pharaoh, represent revelatory authority. False prophecy is always a problem in Israel, especially since such prophecy is usually given in the name of Yahweh. Israel must know that any prophecy that compromises the total claim of God is sedition, for he is the one and only God (4:35, 39). False prophets may be able to provide evidence of authority, and such claims to power are a test to determine Israel's loyalty to God. This is the kind of trial that Israel faced in the wilderness to test their loyalty to him (8:2). Such tests can become temptations to deny trust in God and to follow other gods they do not know. Israel has experienced and knows the salvation of Yahweh, who brought them out of Egypt. A prophet who undermines such hope "has taught rebellion." Such a prophet is adding to the instruction of Moses; such words are sedition or rebellion (Hb. *sarah*), inflicting violence just as the false witness does in 19:16. Such false teaching is at the same time rebellion against God, because Israel knows there is no god among the nations who has led them as Yahweh has (4:6–7). There can be no mercy for such seduction into sedition; Israel must purge such a person from its midst.

<span id="page-155-8"></span><span id="page-155-7"></span><span id="page-155-1"></span>13:6–11 The second test of loyalty is more demanding, as the source is an intimate family member, specifically "the son of your mother," that is, a blood brother, a child, a spouse, or the closest of friends. The emphasis in this description is the deep emotional commitment to the person who is secretly seducing those nearest him to follow other gods. Familiar oaths of loyalty from royal courts began with condemning utterances of disloyalty in the king's family, then the family of friends, and finally any public person, such as a prophet. The oath is concerned entirely with stability in dynasty succession, not on the nature of family relationships. Moses places a deliberate emphasis on the most cherished of relationships because these are most easily prioritized ahead of loyalty to God. The Greek text compromises the intimacy of blood brothers with an additional phrase: "If your brother, the son *of your father* or your mother . . . entices you . . . you shall not assent" (vv. 6–8 AT [7–9 LXX]). This addition is frequently followed, but it appears to be the result of later legal interpretation of the texts. The concern of this passage is loyalty to God above the dearest of relationships; it is most difficult to expose them.

<span id="page-155-6"></span>A situation of seduction within the family cannot be compromised: "You shall not . . . spare him, nor shall you conceal him." The sense of this verse is not that of covering up the sedition as a means of delaying judgment. The form of the <span id="page-156-8"></span><span id="page-156-7"></span><span id="page-156-2"></span>expression corresponds to that of Nehemiah 4:5, which states, "Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out." This same sense is found in Jeremiah 18:23: "Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin." The point Moses is making is that there can be no pity nor forgiveness; this is a matter of treason against God. For this reason, "You shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him" (Deut. 13:9). Many translators follow the Greek at this point (*anangellōn anangeleis peri autou*, "You shall make a report concerning him"; 13:10 LXX), sometimes without explanation. The Greek translator is making allowance for judicial procedure, such as that found in 17:2–4. The translation may have been influenced by legal interpretations familiar at the time of the translator. However, this passage is not about judicial procedure but about the necessity of purging falsehood from Israel in the most difficult of circumstances, namely, when the source of the seduction is someone with whom there is deep emotional attachment.

<span id="page-156-4"></span><span id="page-156-3"></span><span id="page-156-0"></span>13:12–18 The final situation concerns a sedition that encompasses an entire town, the consequence of not dealing with false prophecy when it begins. In this case, careful investigation must be made to ensure that the reports concerning such a city are as claimed. If they are true, the city is to be taken militarily, "devoting it to destruction." This act must be understood theologically; this is the same situation as pertained in the conquest of Sihon (2:31–37) and the rest of the land of Canaan (7:2–6). The *kherem*, as it is known in Hebrew, is a sanctity in which something that belongs to God is removed from all use in the sphere of common life. In the case of living beings, removal from life in the common means death. Unless such total dedication to God is carried out in the case of apostasy, removal of divine judgment is impossible.

<span id="page-156-6"></span><span id="page-156-5"></span><span id="page-156-1"></span>Israel experiences this in the case of Achan (Josh. 7:16–26). The city of Jericho is claimed by God; the defeat of Jericho is entirely the result of divine warfare. Achan does not accept the dictum that everything in Jericho now belongs to the realm of the holy (devoted). As a result, Israel suffers catastrophically in confrontation with the armies of Ai. Not until the *kherem* is removed from Israel—that is, Achan and all those complicit in his rebellion—can there be reconciliation with God. The same situation pertains for an apostate city as with the family of Achan. There is no record of how this may have been carried out in practice, though Judges 19–21 may serve as an example. The rabbis held that it was never to be applied, that the dictum was in the Torah merely for educational purposes. This passage is a theological statement concerning the relationship of the covenant. For Israel to have a holy relationship with God as a treasured people living in the land of Canaan, it is necessary to purge out of the realm of the common all that comes under the irrevocable judgment of God. It would be carried out representatively in the same way it was in the land of Canaan.The purging of apostasy is essential to Israel's observing the covenant commitment. This verse is transitional and serves both to conclude the necessity of preserving holiness by the removal of unfaithfulness and also to introduce the positive confessions of Israel in daily life that they are a

<span id="page-157-1"></span>kingdom of priests (Ex. 19:5–6). Israel is set apart among the nations to represent God to all the earth.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-157-2"></span><span id="page-157-0"></span>The only means of controlling apostasy is to eliminate it, beginning with the individual, which may very well involve family members, or, if necessary, removing a whole community from the common by dedicating it irrevocably to God by means of the *kherem* (13:16). It has been observed that the language of this chapter, especially 12:29–13:11, has a striking resemblance to the Assyrian loyalty oath (*ade*), a means used to maintain fidelity and control distant territories in the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Such oaths were required across the Assyrian Empire, as is evident in tablets recovered from Tell Taʻyinat (on the Orontes River, possibly the ancient biblical Calneh).40 These tablets bear the actual text of an oath required by Esarhaddon in 672 BC to ensure succession of his son Assurbanipal. Copies of this text would have been present in Judah, and the archaeological evidence indicates that the oath (*ade*) would have been on display within the temple during the days of Manasseh.

Based on literary similarity, it is alleged that the scribes of Deuteronomy relied on this Assyrian document to compose the oath commitments of this chapter, as well as some of the curses in chapter 28. Such claims are conjectural. The linguistic similarity does demonstrate that Deuteronomy, as should be expected, shares the language of oath culture common to the ancient Near Eastern world centuries before Esarhaddon. Our knowledge of these oath forms shows how the writing of Moses would have a powerful impact in the warning against adding or taking away from this Torah, to which Israel will swear allegiance when they enter the Promised Land. The concern of Moses is quite different from that of preserving a royal dynasty. He seeks to preserve the nation of Israel through loyalty to their King, Yahweh. He uses language for purging a family or community of dissidents like that used in royal households of great empires.

<span id="page-157-4"></span><span id="page-157-3"></span>Paul also warns against the insidious nature of apostasy. In the church at Ephesus were two such apostates, Hymenaeus and Philetus, who denied the resurrection, saying it was already past (2 Tim. 2:16–19). They apparently had adopted certain Greek philosophical ideas denying the importance of the body and were seeking to integrate these into Christian theology, as in later Gnosticism. This was a fatal compromise of an essential Christian doctrine (cf. 1 Cor. 15:35–49), not just a minor difference on eschatological views. Not only are such ideas worthless, but they spread like a cancer and lead some away from the faith. It is necessary to be intolerant of this kind of deviation in the church. The church found this very difficult, with the result that Gnosticism threatened to subvert the true church in the second century. In more recent times, the so-called Enlightenment has been no less a threat to Christianity, with its rise of deism. Deists attempt to define God their own way and mute his activity in the world.

<sup>40</sup> The full text and commentary of this treaty is provided by Jacob Lauinger, "Esarhaddon's Succession Treaty at Tell Taʻyinat: Text and Commentary," *JCS* 64 (2012): 87–123. An excellent introduction, translation, and commentary of the treaties is provided in D. J. Wiseman, "The Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon," *Iraq* 20/1 (Spring 1958). This is the best place to begin a study of the treaties.

Great revivalists such as John Wesley attempted to address this threat to the church, but today modernist churches are testimony to the way the cancer of autonomous humanism has spread throughout what once were vibrant Christian denominations. The words of Moses in this chapter must be applied with vigor.

#### *Section Overview: Instructions for Holiness*

<span id="page-158-1"></span>This section begins and ends with the statement that Israel is holy (14:2, 21). Holiness is a category that designates the person and being of God. Separateness is fundamental to the sense of being holy, and as a category for God, it distinguishes <span id="page-159-8"></span>him from all creation. In biblical thought, everything in the universe is dependent on God. Fundamental to this conception is the presence of life. Life is not innate to the material elements; it is continuously infused by God into the order of creation (Ps. 104:29). Therefore, to belong to the holy is to have life; separation from the holy is death. These concepts seem to be the basis of the ritual confessions demanded in these verses.

<span id="page-159-6"></span><span id="page-159-5"></span><span id="page-159-3"></span><span id="page-159-2"></span>The assertion "You are a people holy to the Lord your God, and the Lord has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession" (Deut. 14:2) is virtually a repetition of what Moses said in 7:6. In that context, Israel was to separate itself from the Canaanites by putting them under the *kherem*, that is, separating them irrevocably to God. In this case, Moses forbids certain foods because they are an "abomination" (14:3)—they are identified exclusively with pagan practice. In contrast, Israelites are "sons of the Lord" (v. 1), and they must distinguish themselves as belonging to the family of Yahweh. The stipulations of this chapter are a way for Israel to express its adherence to the covenant. The designated foods are made to be representative of the life and wholeness that characterize those who belong to God. There is no indication in the text that forbidden foods are inherently unclean or unhealthy. They may be perfectly acceptable for those who do not confess the covenant; Moses simply says that these foods are "unclean for you" (vv. 7, 8, 10, 19). The classifications that follow in this chapter are part of a systematic ordering of ideas that make them significant only for those following these rituals.

<span id="page-159-9"></span><span id="page-159-4"></span><span id="page-159-1"></span><span id="page-159-0"></span>14:1–2 As children of God, Israel must honor God as their Father (5:16). Parents are the means for children to receive life and its provisions. God is the creator of Israel, but he also cares for them and corrects them as a father (1:31; 8:5). Participating in pagan cultic ritual is a denial of holiness. Cutting oneself was a Canaanite practice of mourning, often accompanied by shaving the head and beard, tearing the clothes, and wearing sackcloth. It was intended as sympathetic magic to appease the gods or influence them to show favor. In one Ugaritic myth, the god Latipan mourns the death of Baal by scraping his skin, shaving his beard, and plowing his chest. This is similarly a sign of the Philistines' mourning at impending judgment (Jer. 47:5). Likewise Moab's citizens cut their hands and shaved their heads as signs

<span id="page-160-11"></span>of mourning (Jer. 48:37). The prohibition in Israel is based on the sacredness of life and respect of the human body. These are a gift of the holy, for God is their Father.

<span id="page-160-7"></span><span id="page-160-6"></span><span id="page-160-5"></span>14:3–8 Clean animals include three types of domesticated bovids (Deut. 14:4) and seven types of undomesticated bovids of the deer family, or caprines (vv. 5). Four animals are examples of forbidden food, particularly the rabbit, rock badger, camel, and pig. The rabbit and rock badger are not ungulates or ruminants, but they do chew their food a long time and may appear to chew the cud. It is not possible to specifically identify all of the ancient designations with known animals.

<span id="page-160-3"></span><span id="page-160-2"></span>The list of land animals in Leviticus is expanded to include insects, rodents, and reptiles. All grasshoppers, those insects that have four legs and leap, are acceptable for food (Lev. 11:20–21). A list of forbidden rodents and reptiles is provided (Lev. 11:29–30), whose impurity is even more consequential than that of land, sea, or sky creatures. The prohibitions include everything that moves on its belly (snakes) or other insects with any number of legs (Lev. 11:41–42); these creatures are regarded as repugnant and "detestable" (Hb. *sheqets*) for food and make the person unclean.

<span id="page-160-8"></span><span id="page-160-4"></span>14:9–10 Water animals are only distinguished by a general rule in both Deuteronomy and Leviticus.

<span id="page-160-9"></span>14:11–20 No general rule is provided for distinguishing between edible and forbidden birds. Those birds that are forbidden are listed, a list exclusive to predators and scavengers. Modern classifications place the bat among mammals because its young are born alive and are nursed by their mother. Ancient classification operated according to simpler anatomical criteria: bats have wings. All "winged insects [*sherets*]" refers to all manner of swarming bugs; these are forbidden as in Leviticus.

<span id="page-160-10"></span><span id="page-160-1"></span><span id="page-160-0"></span>14:21 Hunters and farmers kill their own food. Exodus 22:31 stipulates that the remains of anything killed by an animal must be given to dogs. These might be clean animals, but the means of death has rendered them unfit for food. The reason given is that the people of Israel are to be holy, the status they received by making the covenant at Sinai (Ex. 19:6). Leviticus 17:15 stipulates that eating food prepared from an animal that has not been slaughtered renders the person unclean. There are two possibilities for such food. It may be given to sojourners, non-Israelite neighbors, because they were usually landless and poor, not part of the covenant. Or it may be sold to a foreigner, an individual present in order to conduct business. Ritual purity did not pertain in such cases because these people were not part of the covenant; they were not set apart as holy.

While animals are part of human food, there is always the recognition that animals carry the gift of life no less than humans do. Humans are not entitled to kill animals without reason. Rather, humans are permitted to use animals for food, always acknowledging that this is a gift of God in the present order. The prohibition against consuming blood is a confession of this concession and an acknowledgement that animal life itself does not belong to humans. The prohibition against certain kinds of food preparation falls in the same category. In Israel, <span id="page-161-0"></span>meat would have been eaten at festivals. In Exodus the command not to boil a kid in its mother's milk is part of the festival stipulations (Ex. 23:19; 34:26). The fall festival would be the time at which young goats born that previous spring might be eaten. Here the command is part of provisions for eating meat. Similar stipulations require the young of cattle to be left with their mother at least a week before being made a gift to God, and similar stipulations forbid the slaughtering of cattle on the same day as their young or capturing a bird with her young or her eggs (Lev. 22:27–28; Deut. 22:6–7). Meat boiled in sour milk is much tastier than when simply cooked in water. The prohibition is that this must not be the milk of its mother, recognizing that she is the bearer of this life. It is likely that a kid is mentioned because of the festival contexts of this prohibition elsewhere, but the same rule would pertain to the young of cattle or sheep.

#### <span id="page-161-1"></span>*Response*

The ordering of clean and unclean is an enigma that has generated numerous explanations. Going back to the medieval period, Jewish interpreters, some with a medical background, argued for hygienic reasons, but some of these foods, such as the pig, were commonly eaten and used in religious rituals in ancient times. These are seemingly arbitrary classifications to all those outside the system that gave them significance. The reasons that guide categories of clean and unclean can only be partially discerned, but they have to do with representing holiness, the converse of death.41 An animal that has died may be sold to a non-Israelite neighbor (Deut. 14:21) but is not suitable for Israel. Animals associated with death are prohibited, including all scavengers and carnivorous animals. Pigs and vultures are principally scavengers. High-carriage land animals are classified as clean if they share the characteristics of those raised for food. For pastoralists, these are ruminants with divided hooves. Fish, birds, and insects seem to be further classified by appearance of wholeness or completeness, another way of representing well-ordered life.

<span id="page-161-2"></span>Food for the person outside the purity system of the tabernacle or temple is regulated only by health concerns, as it was in the time of Israel for the sojourner and the foreigner. Jesus declares unequivocally that a person is made unclean or common not by anything that enters the mouth but by that which comes out of the mouth, that is, words (Matt. 15:10–11). Consideration should be given to the sensitivities of others, as decided at the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15:20), but these are concessions for the sake of peace.

<span id="page-161-4"></span><span id="page-161-3"></span>Modern food stipulations based on environmental or economic activism are of an entirely different order, with no relevance to holiness, the concern of this chapter. These are considered by some to be ethical issues, but in virtually all cases are ridden with subjectivity. Even medical concerns not only change but even reverse over time, as may be frequently observed.

**<sup>7</sup>** "If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, **<sup>8</sup>** but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be. **9**Take care lest there be an unworthy thought in your heart and you say, 'The seventh year, the year of release is near,' and your eye look grudgingly*<sup>1</sup>* on your poor brother, and you give him nothing, and he cry to the Lord against you, and you be guilty of sin.

**<sup>10</sup>**You shall give to him freely, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake. **11**For there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore I command you, 'You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.'

**<sup>12</sup>** "If your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold*<sup>2</sup>* to you, he shall serve you six years, and in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. **13**And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed. **14**You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress. As the Lord your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. **15**You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today. **16**But if he says to you, 'I will not go out from you,' because he loves you and your household, since he is well-off with you, **<sup>17</sup>** then you shall take an awl, and put it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your slave*<sup>3</sup>* forever. And to your female slave*<sup>4</sup>* you shall do the same. **<sup>18</sup>** It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for at half the cost of a hired worker he has served you six years. So the Lord your God will bless you in all that you do."

#### *Section Overview: Provisions for the Poor*

<span id="page-163-0"></span>The fourth section on worship in the exposition of this Torah is concerned with regular life cycles that are the means of honoring God. The weekly Sabbath is not developed beyond what is given in the Ten Words (Deut. 5:12–15), where it is a sign (confession) of the rest of redemption. The weekly Sabbath is a significant part of economic and social life, though the details of how it should be practiced, such as how work is defined, are never given. The requirement of worship at one central place also bears a substantial impact on annual life activities. The principal requirements of life order are now given by Moses.

<span id="page-163-1"></span>Food requirements occupy much of all human activity and thus are a very important part of the way in which God must be honored. Food has already been a significant topic in instructions for the life of individual Israelites. Moses now turns to the more general topic of agricultural produce, instructing Israel on the provisions of the agricultural cycle and on incorporating pilgrimages to the central shrine into crop production. For the individual living under the covenant, every activity is in some sense an act of worship through which honor is given to God. Israelites could not make a distinction between things a modern society might call secular and those it calls religious. In Israelite life, social matters (such as care for the poor, giving of the tithe, and pilgrimage to the central shrine) are all part of one integrated system. The giving of the tithe and the firstborn to God are both a matter of learning to "fear the Lord your God always" (14:23). Sowing crops, raising livestock, keeping the Sabbath, and going on pilgrimage festivals are all equally a part of giving honor to God.

<span id="page-164-4"></span>Possession of land is fundamental to life provision in an agrarian society. Deuteronomy is especially alert to the fact that not everyone possesses land. Orphans and widows either do not have access to land or are not able to farm it sufficiently to make a living. Such people constitute the "poor" (Hb. *ʾebyon*; 15:4), a word indicating dependent economic status. This is understood primarily in terms of honor. The poor are the humble (*ʿoni* ) because without their own land they are always in need of help. To care for the poor is to honor them, but more importantly this honors God and becomes the means of blessing. Another situation is loss of use of land through misadventure or simply an inability to farm successfully. These Israelites become indentured, creating a condition in which "your brother . . . is sold to you" (15:12), meaning that this family comes to be in the employ of its benefactors until the obligations are paid. Such dependency can become an endless cycle of debt, contrary to the principle that each person should have freedom to work his own land. Provision for this contingency is made a part of the cycles of the annual calendar according to the Sabbath principle of seven. This cycle operates in days, weeks, months, and years as explained in these provisions for daily life.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-164-2"></span><span id="page-164-1"></span><span id="page-164-0"></span>14:22–27 Only Deuteronomy mandates a tithe of all produce be set aside and taken to the central sanctuary. Other texts give instructions for tithing, but they have more the appearance of an offering than an obligation (Num. 18:21–32; Lev. 27:30–32). In Deuteronomy this is one of the obligations of worship. It may also be a part of the special concern in Deuteronomy for those dependent on the tithe. The tithe here is specified only for three types of produce. This tithe would amount to over a month's supply of these foods. The details of how it is to be dispensed at the temple are not specified, other than that it is eaten as a festival celebration. It may be that the tithe is to be brought at the time of the fall festival pilgrimage, when the harvest is complete, since that is the only time it can be calculated. Since there are three festivals, each a week in length, it may be that food is to be stored there until the next harvest.

<span id="page-164-3"></span>It is not intended for the entire tithe to be consumed by the person bringing the offering. Rather this is the means by which all the Levites (which would include the priests) could join together in the celebration, as specified in Deut. 14:27. Such festivals are not merely a means of celebrating redemption and the divine

blessing; they are also a means of supporting the whole temple system and all the dependents of the people. The logistics would change over time, as evident from the support system of the temple outlined in the last chapter of Leviticus. The tithe there also includes animals (Lev. 27:32–33), which could not be redeemed but belonged to the temple.

<span id="page-165-4"></span><span id="page-165-2"></span>It would not be practical to bring the tithe to the central sanctuary from a distance because of the great quantity of food "when the Lord your God blesses you" (Deut. 14:24). The food would be sold for silver (minted coins did not exist at this time in Israel) and then exchanged for any kind of food desirable for the festival. The tithes and provision of the firstborn animals legislated in Deuteronomy would be a generous contribution for the Levites and all other needy people, as well as providing for a celebration for the farmer of the blessing of harvest.

<span id="page-165-5"></span>14:28–29 The tithe of the third and sixth years are taken not to the central sanctuary but to the gate of the local city. These tithes are to be distributed there to the landless, namely, the Levites, non-Israelite neighbors, orphans, and widows. This provision would extend for two years and would be an important way of honoring the Lord with daily work. This kind of generosity is the means of blessing. Societies that provide for their poor will always receive much more benefit in return.

<span id="page-165-3"></span>This tithe for the Levites is not reconciled with the tithe for the Levites specified in Numbers 18:21–32. There the entire tithe is given to the Levites; the Levites in turn give a tithe of this amount to the priests. Since Deuteronomy envisages a much later time in the history of Israel, with a king, central sanctuary, and pilgrimages, it may be that the legislation of Numbers provides for the earlier centuries, when Israel is a tribal federation.

<span id="page-165-1"></span>No tithe is specified for the seventh year, since in that year the land is not to be cropped. One aspect of the Sabbath confession is a seventh year in addition to the seventh day (Ex. 23:10–12). In that year it is made clear that all of the land belongs to the Lord, as the yield of the land is made freely available for everyone.

<span id="page-165-9"></span><span id="page-165-6"></span><span id="page-165-0"></span>15:1–6 These verses speak of a seven-year cycle, much like the requirement for the land to lie fallow in the seventh year for the sake of the poor (Ex. 23:10–11). These verses seem to presume that practice but add to it the requirement for debts to be released as well. This was the practice in the time of Nehemiah, at least (Neh. 10:31). Debts would normally come due at harvest time, the occasion of new revenue. If debts cannot be paid in years in which there is crop revenue, they must be waived in the seventh year, which includes no harvest for the landowner. The person owing the money is "his neighbor, his brother" (Deut. 15:2), most likely an actual relative but certainly a fellow Hebrew. This remission does not pertain to business debts that might be made with other non-Israelites. The main objective is to provide relief from indebtedness that can result in the inability to recover the use of one's own land.

<span id="page-165-8"></span><span id="page-165-7"></span>Remission of debt establishes stability within the community. This is fundamental to covenant relationship, as emphasized in the exhortation of verses 4–6. Israel is not to have within her bounds any poor who are not in some way provided for by the care of the community.

<span id="page-166-8"></span><span id="page-166-7"></span>15:7–11 Since the seventh year can be calculated, it might be tempting to deny help in the fifth or sixth year, knowing there might be no repayment at all. But the spirit of the covenant is not to do as little as possible in order to meet the demands of the covenant. The goal is always to provide as much help as needed; when the poor are provided for, everyone fares better. This is the way that "God will bless you" (v. 10). That "there will never cease to be poor" (v. 11) might seem to be a contradiction to the assertion that "there will be no poor" (v. 4), but each of these statements speaks to the same reality. There will always be people who come into poverty; illness and death are not respecters of persons. On the other hand, a society that always cares for those in difficult circumstances will always benefit.

<span id="page-166-10"></span><span id="page-166-9"></span><span id="page-166-6"></span><span id="page-166-2"></span><span id="page-166-1"></span>15:12–18 Provision for forgiveness of debt is to be made in accordance with the seven-year sabbatical cycle. A more severe form of debt would be a case in which someone can no longer borrow money but is required to give up land as collateral and enter the service of his creditor. The time of such servitude is limited to seven years. The seven-year period of labor is not related to the sabbatical cycle but begins when the person starts the term of service. The provisions for a maximum of six years of service are related to those found in Exodus 21:1–2. Deuteronomy augments those provisions in several respects. Freedom is inclusive of female as well as male servants (Deut. 15:12). In Exodus a woman in debt servitude is under the control of her master (Ex. 21:4, 7–10); if the master has given the servant as a wife, she remains with the master. If a man gives his daughter for debt, the master must let her be redeemed or treat her as a wife. As in the case of the tenth word, concerning coveting (Ex. 20:17; Deut. 5:21), the woman is given an independent status in Deuteronomy, demonstrating a consistent concern for the rights of the woman. A further benefit in Deuteronomy is that all debt servants must be given abundant provision in order to enable them to regain independent status (15:13–15). The regulations for indebted servants make provision for someone to permanently work for another person if he decides that is preferable.

<span id="page-166-11"></span><span id="page-166-5"></span><span id="page-166-4"></span><span id="page-166-3"></span><span id="page-166-0"></span>The jubilee regulations for release of debt servants and restoration of property make provisions for the clan, aggregates of families that are a subset of the tribe. Those regulations prevent loss of property to the tribe. Under those regulations, release from debt and the restoration of property happens on the fiftieth year (Lev. 25:10, 13, 28). If a family becomes indentured to a benefactor, it works only until the fiftieth year, at which time it returns to its clan (Lev. 25:39–41). A fifty-year span would encompass most of the life of an individual. Freedom in the fiftieth year is thus not as relevant to the individual as it is to the group, which is to be reintegrated with its tribal family. In this way one tribe does not lose property to another. This is in keeping with the principle that women who inherit land must marry within their own tribe (Num. 36:5–9). In addressing situations of debt relating to the clan, Leviticus makes no mention of the seven-year release provided for in Deuteronomy.

It is likely that the jubilee law of Leviticus addresses the situation of the person who chooses to become a permanent debt servant. The commitment of servitude would not extend perpetually for the family, which would receive its freedom in the fiftieth year. In this way property would always revert to the original clan and families would be able to live in self-sufficiency. There were to be no permanent debt-servant clans.

<span id="page-167-0"></span>Israel is reminded repeatedly of the redemption that they received when slaves in Egypt. They are children of God (Deut. 14:1), and thus they are expected to conduct their lives according to the mercy they have received from their father. Laws of debt relief are to be regarded not as a burden but as a testimony to their own beliefs about how God redeemed them from slavery.

#### *Response*

Modern thinking attempts to separate secular life from religious faith, as if these had no relation to each other. This is manifest in presumed rights and freedoms that promise freedom of faith apart from any state interference. In Christianity, such a distinction is impossible. Christian faith demands an integration of all areas of life, as assumed by the instruction of Moses concerning worship. Economic affairs, property, and care for the poor are as integral to the practice of faith and covenant as is any other ritual. Further, the values defined as secular function as the equivalent to those of faith; in practice, such "secular" values are a religious or faith system. The inability to separate these spheres makes living the Christian life a challenge, as demands imposed by the state may well contradict those held by the Christian. These can include matters of taxation or other benefits. In Canada, for example, job funding universally available to help the poor is withheld from anyone who does not support the state provision of abortion without restriction, even at the point of childbirth. Such job funding is supposed to help the poor, but it is available only to those adhering to what is in effect a state religious policy.

<span id="page-167-3"></span><span id="page-167-2"></span>The apostle Paul explains the continuum of faith and life in his teaching that the Christian has a new mind created in righteousness and true holiness (Eph. 4:23–24). This new way of thinking affects the most fundamental aspects of life, especially work and words (vv. 25–30). Paul's exhortation is that work should be performed for the purpose of being able to give to those in need. Words must be spoken only when they are edifying to those who hear them. These are the very kind of values Moses is eliciting in this chapter. The purpose of work is to support fellow property owners and the community. This is not the spirit of the adversarial relationship between unions and employers that affects many Christians in western society. Living the teaching of Moses in the contemporary situation is a real challenge if one seeks earnestly to maintain the values of faith for life.

<span id="page-167-1"></span>In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus uses this passage from Deuteronomy in his own instruction concerning work and well-being (Matt. 6:19–24). There he employs three metaphors: laying up of treasures, clarity of vision, and attempting to serve two masters. The second of these metaphors has to do with focus of <span id="page-168-2"></span><span id="page-168-0"></span>vision. Disciples have their focus on the kingdom of God, a clear vision. If their "eye is bad" (Matt. 6:23), they are disadvantaged as a blind man. The evil eye is drawn from Deuteronomy 15:9, an expression of resentment over the obligation to help a poor brother just before the year of remittance of debt. This is the attitude of stinginess rather than the desire to help another in need. Disciples of Jesus will seek to follow the teaching of Moses in working their best to help those in need in every way they can.

**<sup>19</sup>** "All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and flock you shall dedicate to the Lord your God.

#### *Section Overview: Ceremonies at the Central Sanctuary*

Deuteronomy emphasizes the social aspect of temple, sacrifices, and offerings. Sacral offerings are consumed by the person coming to the sanctuary, where they are shared with the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the Levite. This continuous emphasis leaves the impression that the primary purpose of sacrifice is nutrition for the needy. Deuteronomy teaches an aspect of sacrifice not found in the covenant instructions given at Sinai. The rituals declared at Sinai, so essential to the understanding of Yahweh, are assumed in Deuteronomy. The practical manifestation of faith, keeping the covenant by caring for the community, is the constant emphasis of Deuteronomy. A complete understanding of the covenant requires both theology and its implementation. After the utter failures of the rebellious generation of the wilderness, the renewal of the covenant quite appropriately emphasizes the responsibilities of the individual to the community in the Promised Land.

<span id="page-169-1"></span><span id="page-169-0"></span>The ceremonies at the central sanctuary consist of offerings of firstborn animals and three pilgrimage festivals. All three festivals bear a relationship to the agricultural cycle, which is integrated with the confession of Israel's redemption and covenant with God. No time is specified for the offering of the firstborn, whereas the annual pilgrimage festivals begin with the first harvest of the agricultural year (16:1–2). The pilgrimage festivals operate on the basis of the number seven. Seven weeks are counted from the first of the grain harvest to the harvest festival celebration, and in the seventh month of the year a final celebration is held after the entire crop has been gathered (v. 13). Passover celebrates redemption from Egypt, while the harvest festival implicitly celebrates the giving of the law that took place in the third month after Israel left Egypt (Ex. 19:1; cf. Deut. 16:12). The great festival of harvest celebrates God's redemptive provision in the wilderness.

The restriction of limiting the offering of the firstborn and the observance of the festivals to the central location will result in significant changes in social structure and the function of the priesthood. Deuteronomy anticipates these changes, so the practice of the rituals is accommodated accordingly, whether it be the dedication of the firstborn or the celebration of the Passover. The ritual confession is not a matter of unalterable regulations; it is always a confession of the covenant. The practice of the rituals therefore is modified to accommodate changed circumstances. This is an alteration not of the covenant but of specific practices to provide for the ideals of covenant observance. The effort of the rabbis in harmonizing the ritual into a single legislative system misunderstood its purpose. Ritual is not a system of regulation but a means of spiritual formation as well as a confession of beliefs.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-170-3"></span><span id="page-170-0"></span>15:19–23 The firstborn of an animal belongs to the Lord, just as the firstfruits of the crop do. This is one way of making the confession that God is the source and owner of all life. This confession is first found in the creation narrative, with the offerings of Cain and Abel (Gen. 4:2–4). Both the farmer and the herdsman brought offerings appropriate to the divine blessing. The teaching of Deuteronomy is already implicit in the Genesis account. The offering of the first of the harvest and of animals must be done as a confession of love and fear of Yahweh. Abel offered the choicest of the firstborn; Cain merely brought an offering. Ritual apart from the faith commitment of the participant has no merit.

<span id="page-170-2"></span><span id="page-170-1"></span>In Deuteronomy, the offering of the firstborn is done at the central sanctuary and is eaten by the herdsman making the offering. This appears to be an advancement of the earlier requirements. In the original covenant, the offering of the firstborn of clean animals belongs to the Lord as a confession of the slaying of the firstborn in Egypt and the sparing of Israel at the time of the exodus (Ex. 13:11– 15). Unclean animals and the firstborn of humans are redeemed. Deuteronomy is also a development of the law of the firstborn as given in the wilderness. There the firstborn belongs to the *kherem*, that is, the irrevocable dedication that cannot be redeemed (Num. 18:14). In Numbers, humans and unclean animals can be redeemed; unclean animals may be bought back by the owner for use on his farm. All other firstfruits and the firstborn of animals are proscribed. In this case, they must be eaten by the families of the priests. Leviticus conforms to the regulation of

<span id="page-171-8"></span><span id="page-171-7"></span><span id="page-171-3"></span>Numbers in declaring that the firstborn is *kherem* (Lev. 27:26–29). Leviticus includes humans in the items that may be so proscribed, such as someone guilty of a capital crime (Ex. 22:20). In Deuteronomy, Moses makes the individual making the offering responsible to "dedicate" it to the Lord (*qadash*; Deut. 15:19), which does not make its use exclusive to the sanctuary or the priests. It is, however, a sacred meal, probably reflecting the circumstances of a later time in which worship was limited to the single place the Lord would choose. There was no longer a need to support clergy at the more local sanctuaries.

<span id="page-171-9"></span><span id="page-171-5"></span><span id="page-171-4"></span>16:1–8 Passover celebrates the exodus from Egypt. It consists of two festivals: the sacrifice of the Passover animal and the seven-day festival of *mazzot*, the Feast of Unleavened Bread (cf. Lev. 23:6). Since the Passover meal also involves unleavened bread, the two are described as one (Lev. 23:4). The time of the feast is calculated according to the moon of the month of "Abib" (= "new ears of grain"). In later Babylonian nomenclature, this is the month of Nisan. Since the lunar cycle was also the basis of the agricultural calendar, the months had to be kept concurrent with the seasons. Twelve lunar cycles constitute only 354 days, requiring the periodic addition of a lunar equivalent. At some point the Babylonians determined that 235 lunar cycles equaled 19 solar cycles, so they could be very precise in integrating 7 lunar months during a 19-year period. Modern-day Passover is celebrated on a modification of that cycle.

<span id="page-171-10"></span><span id="page-171-6"></span><span id="page-171-2"></span><span id="page-171-1"></span><span id="page-171-0"></span>"Passover" is a translation of the Hebrew *pesakh.* The origin of this term cannot be determined, but it has the sense of "protective sacrifice." The English term *Passover* comes from the Latin translation; the LXX uses the verb *skepazō* for the Lord's covering or protecting the Israelites (Ex. 12:13; cf. Isa. 31:5). Making the Passover sacrifice into a pilgrimage festival brings about modifications. The meal is no longer celebrated as a family, with the blood of the sacrificial lamb smeared on the doorposts and lintel. It becomes a communal event in which a larger animal can be chosen from the sheep or goats (Ex. 12:5). Deuteronomy 16:2 includes bovines, which later Jewish exegesis takes to be additional offerings (cf. 2 Chron. 35:7–13). It is no longer specified that the animal be roasted (Ex. 12:8), only that it must be cooked (Hb. *bashal* often means "to boil"). The Passover is to be eaten with unleavened bread, signifying the hasty circumstance of the flight from Egypt. The urgency of harvest requires the pilgrim to return home following the Passover sacrifice, but he is to continue eating unleavened bread for six more days (Deut. 16:7–8). Leaven is to be removed from the entire territory (v. 4), not just from the central sanctuary. On the seventh day after the sacrifice, counting the day as beginning at sunset, a festal gathering is to be held. This would take place in the various towns and cities to which the pilgrims return—only the sacrificial food is to be consumed at the central place. Deuteronomy only mentions the assembled festival for the Passover, but the other festivals had one as well (Lev. 23:21, 35–36). The conclusion of unleavened bread takes place at home during the height of harvest, when greater temptation to neglect the duties of the festival might be present.

<span id="page-172-5"></span><span id="page-172-0"></span>16:9–12 The Feast of Weeks derives its name from the method used to calculate its date. The feast is unique in that a precise date for the celebration of the feast is not given. The counting begins with an offering of the first sheaf of the harvest on the day after the Sabbath (Lev. 23:10–11). The time of harvest varies from year to year and place to place, depending on the weather. It is possible the time of the feast would vary from region to region. Debate has centered on whether the Sabbath specified is a Sunday or the day after the Sabbath of a festival, such as the first day of Unleavened Bread. A later halachic ruling used the latter interpretation to state that the first sheaf must be brought on the second day of the feast, namely, the sixteenth of Nisan, so the Feast of Weeks always falls on the seventh of Sivan in the Babylonian calendar (May/June). The Torah simply specifies that it be the first day after the Sabbath.

<span id="page-172-1"></span>Harvest is a festive time. The offerings of harvest are voluntary according to the blessing of the harvest. A time of plenty may be expected to be a time of greater generosity. According to Leviticus, the Feast of Weeks is also a solemn assembly in which no work is done (Lev. 23:16–21). It consists of offerings of loaves made of new grain as firstfruits of the harvest. The various offerings by fire make it a complete festal occasion.

<span id="page-172-8"></span><span id="page-172-4"></span>At least by the time of the second temple, the Feast of Weeks became the occasion to dramatize the revelatory event at Sinai, known in Hebrew as the *zeman mattan Toratenu* ("time when our Torah was given"), and to make a renewed oath of the giving of the law. This may be the festival setting of Psalms 50 and 81. These festal psalms are a proclamation of the theophany and celebration of the commandments in another era. The day of the assembly, as expressed in Deuteronomy 9:10; 10:4, was when Israel received the Word of God through an apparently dramatized ritual and then took upon themselves the Ten Words by covenant and oath. This was the counterpart to the dramatization of the exodus at Passover and of the wilderness by the erection of booths. In 2 Chronicles 15:8–15 we read of a great assembly under King Asa in the third month, in which participants come from Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Judah, and Simeon. They offer sacrifices, enter a covenant to seek the Lord with all their heart and soul, and take oaths to the accompaniment of blasts from the trumpets and shofar (cf. Ps. 81:3). All this is done with great joy, which may speak to the occasion of a festival in which the rite of a covenant renewal is observed.

<span id="page-172-9"></span><span id="page-172-7"></span>The celebration of Weeks is much better known from later Jewish writings and the NT. As is typical in Deuteronomy, there is no attention to accompanying festal celebrations, such as those mentioned in Leviticus. The emphasis is entirely on being proportionately generous to the blessing of the harvest.

<span id="page-172-6"></span><span id="page-172-3"></span><span id="page-172-2"></span>16:13–15 Booths is a full, eight-day festival, with sacred assemblies on the first and last days (cf. Lev. 23:33–36). The festival takes place after all the harvest has been gathered. Booths is characterized by ceremonies of festal processions adorned with fruits and decorative palms (Lev. 23:40). As the last of the harvest, this is the most joyous of festivals. It is also the time of year when the labor of the field is

<span id="page-173-4"></span>not pressing. According to Deuteronomy 31:10–13, this is the occasion of the teaching of the Torah every seventh year. In later Jewish tradition this is also the time of prayers for rain.

<span id="page-173-5"></span><span id="page-173-1"></span>The Festival of Booths is explicitly connected in Leviticus 23:42–43 to the time of wilderness wanderings. The connection of Booths to the time of the wilderness is not self-evident, for at that time Israel lived in tents. Booths are connected to harvest, when the fruit is ripening and being gathered. Booths are set up in the fields for shelter from sun and rain (e.g., Isa. 1:8). An apt symbol for the completion of the harvest and the celebration of bounty is a booth of the type used in the fields at harvest. This also becomes a way of remembering God's bountiful provision during the years of wilderness wandering.

<span id="page-173-3"></span>16:16–17 God is the sovereign King, who reigns from the temple. His subjects are required to appear before him in acknowledgement of his rule. Only adult males of the family are obligated to make their appearance three times a year at the central sanctuary. The celebrations themselves are inclusive, as is repeatedly emphasized. There may be a practical side to this requirement's being limited to males, as nursing mothers and young children could not easily make a journey of several days.

<span id="page-173-2"></span><span id="page-173-0"></span>The Passover sacrifice is here referred to as the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The obligation at the sanctuary is limited to the night of the Passover (Deut. 16:7), and the workers then return home but eat unleavened bread for seven days. According to the instructions of the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread begins on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening (Ex. 12:6). The summary appropriately concludes with the emphasis of social responsibility present in the entire section: each family must be represented, bearing gifts in proportion to the way that God has blessed them. The goal of prosperity is the ability to give more.

#### *Response*

Deuteronomy does not repeat or alter the function of the priesthood found in Leviticus. The ritual in Leviticus focuses on the work of the priests in the daily ritual of the temple. That ritual is intended to declare the holiness of God as the source of all life. The confession of Yahweh made in temple ritual positions the priest as a mediator between those in the realm of mortality and the Giver of life, symbolized in the Most Holy Place. The temple and priesthood declare perpetually that God is the continuous source of life to ward off the power of death, which threatens in many ways. This aspect of declaring the divine presence in the world of the common is not explicit in Deuteronomy. The covenant that Moses renews with Israel does not negate this ritual but brings to it a different emphasis: the personal role and responsibility of the individual Israelite in providing for life. Expiation is accomplished by the confessions of the person making an offering, not by the illocutionary declarations of a priest. This ritual is a very important confession, but it has no merit as an independent activity. The faith of the persons making the offerings is essential for it to be efficacious, which is the constant emphasis of Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-174-1"></span>Relationship with God is not found in either observance of ritual or the performance of good deeds. As expressed in Psalm 40, a relationship with God is established and maintained by faith, which expresses itself in the desire to do the will of God:

 In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required. Then I said, "Behold I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart." (Ps. 40:6–8)

<span id="page-174-2"></span>The will of God written in the scroll does include the bringing of offerings to express the need of cleansing and forgiveness, but these must be the expression of a submissive and repentant heart. The will of God requires care for the poor and dependent, which in Israel is a part of the temple ritual. Care for the poor in Israel is so rooted in temple pilgrimage that the two cannot be separated. Pilgrimage requires the bringing of gifts, but neither of these should be done out of obligation. These practices arise from faith in God, which inspires a desire to do his will.

#### *Section Overview: Governance Regulations*

Centralization brings administrative changes, especially the necessity of a centralized judicial system and governance, the provision of a king along with officials of his administration. It will be centuries before the tribes of Israel occupy the territory of the Promised Land and can establish a centralized government. Moses anticipates the time of Israel as an organized kingdom in the land. He makes provisions for state institutions, but not in the specific sense of a constitution. His provision is not a systematic definition of offices and duties but rather the general principles of governance. In contrast to the surrounding governments, the authority of officials is limited and accountable. The concept is a sense of equality and brotherhood under a single covenant. These regulations are to ameliorate the dangers of status and power by a ruling elite.

<span id="page-176-3"></span>Such centralized structure of governance is original to Deuteronomy; there are no parallel regulations elsewhere in the Torah. Knowledge of these regulations provides empowerment to the members of the covenant. It is a means by which the people can resist and protest abuses of authority. It is the reason why prophets can challenge kings; Nathan can be expected to call David to account when he abuses his power in executing an army general in order to make that officer's wife a part of his harem (2 Sam. 12:1–12). Greedy kings such as Ahab suffer the ultimate judgment of death and dynastic failure for violating the property rights of a private citizen (1 Kings 22:34–38; 2 Kings 9:21–26). The reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah are consistently evaluated according to the legislation of Deuteronomy. In the renewal of the covenant, Moses makes provision for Israel to become a kingdom. The caveat is that the kings of Israel are not to be like the other nations'. The political reality is that power is inevitably driven beyond the limits set for it.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-176-2"></span><span id="page-176-1"></span><span id="page-176-0"></span>16:18–20 Every local center is to appoint "judges and officers." Officers have a record-keeping function (cf. comment on 1:14–18). These officials are usually listed first with the judges, but they appear to have a subordinate function. The officers and judges are appointed by the people, much like the judges in the wilderness (1:9–17). The participation of the community is a critical component in the selection of its officers. Qualifications for the execution of justice are the same as when judges were first chosen: recognized leaders must have demonstrated their wisdom and shown an understanding of how to assess situations. The judicial system of the <span id="page-177-0"></span>wilderness was a temporary provision. Once the nation was organized as a state, a centrally structured judicial system was necessary. Nothing is said of the relationship between elders and judges. It is likely that judges were chosen from among the elders. When Moses was unable to carry the burden of the people, God instructed him to select leaders from among the elders (Num. 11:16–17). The same officers (Hb. *shoterim*) are named there. The priests also had a role in exercising justice (cf. Deut. 17:9), but nothing suggests they were among the appointed judges. In later times judges were appointed by national figures, but royally appointed judges are limited to Jerusalem.

<span id="page-177-7"></span><span id="page-177-6"></span><span id="page-177-5"></span>The requirements for impartial justice are addressed to the people, not merely to the judges (v. 19). These three stipulations are reiterated frequently in the Bible. Bribes are literally a "gift" (*shohad*), which corrupt officials claim as a payment for services (Isa. 1:23). The metonymy is natural; gifts often imply some sense of reciprocation, since receiving gifts can leave a person indentured to the giver. For a judge, even a gift accepted as a fee is unacceptable because it will tend to influence decisions. The explanation at the end of the verse suggests that this is not simply a bribe. The closing appeal of this section emphasizes that the objective pursuit of justice is always to the benefit of everyone.

<span id="page-177-4"></span><span id="page-177-3"></span><span id="page-177-2"></span>16:21–17:1 The sequences in the exposition of the laws are frequently tangential; laws are related, but they are not given in an orderly or topical fashion. Josephus said that Moses left the laws in disarray, written as he had learned them from God (*Antiquities* 4.197). Ancient Near Eastern laws are often concatenated by means of assonance or key terms. In this case, it may be that the form of the verb for not perverting justice in 16:19 (Hb. *tatteh*) links to not planting (*tittaʿ*; v. 21) an "Asherah." The three prohibitions that follow are representative of cult worship and are natural examples of issues judges would need to adjudicate in a covenant context.42 It is explicitly said that an Asherah is a tree that is planted (v. 21). Such a place of worship was constituted by a leveled stone platform beside a tree or a grove of trees. The term *Asherah* is regularly used as synecdoche for the whole platform and its altar.43 Such platforms were characterized by an "altar" (*mizbeach*) and a "pillar" (*matsebah*), all technical terms for ritual artifacts. The pillar was an erect stone representing a Canaanite god. With the centralization envisaged by Deuteronomy, all such platforms for worship are forbidden for Israelites. Israel must have its own specified place of worship that does not include these cultic items.

Sacrifices are to be brought to the central location. Such sacrifices are not regular food. These are a confession of divine provision, as Moses explains. As representative food, such animals are dedicated—they are holy and therefore cannot be defective in any way. Judges might be called upon to make decisions as to whether an animal is qualified to be representative in this fashion.

<span id="page-177-1"></span><sup>42</sup> For an explanation of Asherahas a place of worship and a description of the platform cf. comment on 7:1–6. 43 Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which part of an object is used for the whole, such as "fifty sails," meaning fifty ships by the naming of the means by which they are powered. Similarly, one might say "those are awesome wheels," referring to an impressive car.

<span id="page-178-11"></span><span id="page-178-7"></span>17:2–7 Moses describes the procedure that is to be followed in the locations at which judges have been selected. Deuteronomy here again is inclusive, with its reference to both men and women; women have their own status and carry their own responsibility. This is the only instance in Deuteronomy of the phrase translated "transgressing his covenant" (Hb. *laʿabor berito*). This verb is used regularly to speak of crossing over a territory. It may be used again deliberately in 29:12, where God leads Israel to "enter into the sworn covenant." Those who have crossed into the covenant by means of an oath are liable if they then deny that oath in leaving the covenant by crossing over any of its stipulations. Denial of the covenant oath could take any form of subservience to the creation rather than the Creator. The heavenly bodies are typically represented as gods in other religions (e.g., the sun god Shemesh, or Baal as rider of the clouds). Allegations that this has taken place must be investigated very thoroughly; this is the most serious of offenses, with an ultimate penalty of death, since the words of the oath are taken in the name of Yahweh. However, it is all too easy for disgruntled individuals to lay dubious charges. Such cases would not easily be proven, for it would take the agreement of two or three independent witnesses. The integrity of the witnesses is tested, in that they must be the ones taking the initiative in an execution. Any false representation in this instance could not be atoned.

<span id="page-178-8"></span><span id="page-178-3"></span><span id="page-178-1"></span><span id="page-178-0"></span>17:8–13 The central court is not a court of appeal but a court of referral for those cases that cannot be determined. The cases given as examples at Mount Sinai are good examples of subjective situations (Ex. 21–23). Homicide might be unintended or might be a case of willful planned attack (Ex. 21:12–14); situations of missing property could be complicated by circumstances (Ex. 22:6–14). Assault could involve the loss of an unborn child or various kinds of permanent bodily injury, for which appropriate monetary compensation would need to be determined (Ex. 21:22–25). Revenge is never permitted under the covenant; justice is always measured in terms of appropriate compensation. This is one of the ways Israelite law is unlike that of all other known law codes.

<span id="page-178-10"></span><span id="page-178-9"></span><span id="page-178-6"></span><span id="page-178-5"></span><span id="page-178-4"></span><span id="page-178-2"></span>The composition of the central court is not specified. The role of the priest in the judicial system is mentioned only in Deuteronomy (19:17). Priests are otherwise involved in those cases that cannot be solved and must be referred to God through oaths, the Urim and Thummim (Ex. 28:29–30; Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 28:6; Ezra 2:63), or ritual ordeals (Num. 5:11–31). It may be that Deuteronomy provides a role for priests in the judicial system apart from sacred rites because of their knowledge of the law and their role in teaching the regulations of the covenant (Lev. 10:11). Priests are also responsible for retaining copies of the Torah (Deut. 17:18; 31:9, 24–26). Priests may well have been regarded as the experienced interpreters of covenant responsibilities. Ancient law did not operate in casuistic fashion, as does modern law. Laws were given as examples, rather than precedents, to provide guidance in types of cases, but even so correct interpretation of the intended outcome was very important.

The decisions of the central court may not be disregarded, either by another judge or by the individual. Dismissing a court decision is a capital crime even if the punishment for the crime committed is not a capital offense. The involvement of the priest in such cases indicates that God is involved in the decision, which makes its disregard a capital case.

<span id="page-179-4"></span><span id="page-179-2"></span><span id="page-179-1"></span><span id="page-179-0"></span>17:14–20 The king of Israel described in Deuteronomy is not like other nations'. The Greek translator understood this and paraphrased the word "king" (Hb. *melek*) as "ruler" (Gk. *archōn*). The only other occurrence of *melek* translated as *archōn* in the LXX is in the blessing of Balaam (Num. 23:21), where it refers to God. The king does not grant a covenant and law to the people, as in all the other nations, but must live under the covenant renewed under Moses; he must be one among his brothers (Deut. 17:15). When Israel asks for a king, it is for him to fulfill a role in the central court and exercise judgment (1 Sam. 8:5)—a function of all kings and to provide for national defense (1 Sam. 8:20). The problem is not having a king in each of these capacities, which is provided for in the regulations of Moses. The problem with Israel's asking for a king is their rejection of Yahweh as King (1 Sam. 8:7; cf. Judg. 8:23). It is quite impossible for Israel to have a king under the covenant when the covenant itself has been rejected by the people. Israel in this situation is like all the other nations.

<span id="page-179-7"></span><span id="page-179-6"></span><span id="page-179-5"></span><span id="page-179-3"></span>It is possible, however, for God to appoint a king over Israel as part of the fulfillment of his covenant with Israel, as when God anoints his own king in Zion. God declares his loyalty to the king he has anointed (2 Sam. 7:11–17), and the king in turn declares that this people belongs to the God who has redeemed them (2 Sam. 7:18–24). The declaration that there is no other god as this who has redeemed a people for himself through great and awesome deeds is particularly Deuteronomic. In establishing his king, God at the same time secures a covenant people for himself. Psalm 2, a celebration of the anointing of David, affirms the rule of the divinely chosen king over all nations. In this psalm the rule of Israel's king and the rule of God are fully unified. Kingship is essential to covenant, but this is not the kind of king or covenant found in other nations.

<span id="page-179-8"></span>The covenant faith of Deuteronomy contrasts above all with the ideologies of Mesopotamia and Egypt, the nations with the greatest influence over Israel. In Mesopotamia, kingship was created by the gods for the well-being of human society; the king in turn created and granted laws that he gave to the people. The king was above the law. In Egypt the king was a god and therefore embodied the law.

The instructions of Moses stress proscriptions against the usual excesses of kings rather than the responsibilities of the king. The responsibility of the king, stated simply, is to lead the people in obedience to the covenant. For this reason the king is responsible to have a copy of this Torah and to read it so that he may learn to fear God, the fundamental covenant requirement. This surrender of the king to the covenant is the antithesis of human hubris typical of kings. Such hubris manifests itself chiefly in three vices characteristic of kings: military power, wealth, and a larger harem (to secure alliances with other nations and numerous offspring to act as heirs and officials). Such royal aspirations are a threat to Israel's hope for longevity in the land.

<span id="page-180-3"></span><span id="page-180-2"></span><span id="page-180-1"></span><span id="page-180-0"></span>By the measure of Deuteronomy, kingship in Israel is a failure. The first requirement is for the king to be one of God's choosing (Deut. 17:15). The first king of Israel meets that qualification but immediately is also the king God rejects (1 Sam. 13:13). The Lord then seeks a prince for his people "after his own heart" (1 Sam. 13:14). The phrase "after his own heart" refers to the divine choice—God sets his mind (heart) on this man. God commissions Samuel to anoint David as the king of his choice (1 Sam. 16:1–13). In the narrative of Israel it is only this first criterion, the divine choice, that makes possible the continuation of the covenant and the kingdom. The consequences of David's failures will haunt him continuously. Not empire-building capabilities but submission in repentance enables David to become the king of promise.

#### *Response*

The maintenance of what is now called civil order is one of the greatest contrasts between the old covenant and the new covenant of the Christian. There is no civil order under the covenant of Moses because the order of the nation is subsumed under the covenant relationship with God. This distinction is evident already in Israelite times, with no distinction between the sacred and ordinary life. In other nations the king held a position as a god or a direct ordination of the gods, which gave him and the ruling class a status independent from all ordinary people. In the epilogue of the Law Code of Hammurabi, the king declares himself preeminent and without equal. The statutes he has given are never to be rescinded, and his justice will prevail by order of Shamash.44

While Israel is radically distinct in its own context, the NT church has no direct engagement in the government of its time. The charge against Jesus at the crucifixion is sedition in claiming to be King of the Jews. When Pilate asks Jesus specifically about this claim, Jesus tells him that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:33–36). Proof of this is that his disciples do not resist his arrest. The mission of the Jesus is to make disciples of all nations. The charge to the church is not to establish a Christian nation.

<span id="page-180-4"></span>In the days of the Roman Empire, Christians everywhere found themselves subordinated to one nation. Once Christians were clearly distinguished from other Jews, they suffered more mercilessly for their insistence on belonging to another kingdom. A letter from the church at Smyrna describes the mob at the martyrdom of Polycarp: "All the crowd, astonished at the noble conduct of the of the Godbeloved and God-fearing race of Christians, cried out, 'Away with the atheists.'"45 Christians in that world had no possible engagement with the powers of state.

<sup>44</sup> *ANET*, 178.

<sup>45</sup> Henry Bettenson and Chris Maunder, eds., *Documents of the Christian Church*, 4th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 9. *Documents of the Christian Church* is a convenient volume for consulting such fundamental documents.

It was in many ways a sad day for the church when it became an attempted means of bringing unity to the Roman Empire and subsequently began to have not only privilege but also power. When such power began to accrue to the church, it was anything but a model of the kind of civil service described by Moses. Since the time of the Reformation the influence of the church in political matters has continuously eroded to the point that the church is marginalized in many societies and not tolerated in others. Christians are again the most persecuted group in the world, especially in the Middle East, India, and China. The continuous calling of Christians in all eras is to follow the example of Jesus by enduring suffering for doing good (1 Pet. 2:20–25). The example of Jesus before Pilate at his trial is the calling of Christians.

<span id="page-181-2"></span><span id="page-181-1"></span>This is not to minimize the importance of good social order of the kind described by Moses nor the value of Christians' becoming engaged in the process of such order as they are able. However, this is an individual calling within the church, not a collective mission of the church. The church is mandated not to create a good society but to be salt and light in whatever society it may be found (Matt. 5:13–16). Finding ways to be such salt and light in increasingly pluralistic societies takes a great deal of wisdom and should never be done in reaction to the many outrages society engenders.

#### *Section Overview: Priests and Prophets*

Priests and prophets are important leaders alongside their political and judicial counterparts. Every society must deal with two issues. One is the relationship of the individual to society; the second is the alignment of society with the natural world. The first issue is settled by law and government; the second is resolved by belief. The two issues are intimately related. Laws and government of a society are wholly dependent on what moderns call a "metanarrative," namely, those beliefs used to interpret all other phenomena. Every society has a collective belief that serves as the basis for its collective values. In Israel, the basis of law and government was determined by divine revelation. Moses now turns to the means by which divine revelation is to function in Israel.

One aspect of revelation is to make regular confession of Yahweh as the sovereign and ever-present Lord of the covenant. The confession of their incomparable God is made through the tabernacle and involves every aspect of daily life. The tribe of Levi is devoted to serving the confessions of Israel through the tent of meeting. Moses therefore turns his attention to provisions for the Levitical priests. Their God is known through his words and deeds as mediated by Moses. Provision must also be made for the prophetic function of Moses to continue. While Deuteronomy limits the authority of kings, the authority of the prophet is strengthened.

The assignments of the Levites in the wilderness were very specific. A census was taken of the three sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari (Num. 3:17). In that context, their duties were specifically assigned. The tribes of Gershon and Merari had primary responsibility for guarding the tabernacle and providing security for all the rituals associated with it (Num. 3:7, 25, 36). The sons of Kohath were responsible for the porterage of the tabernacle (Num. 4:47). These duties were kept separate from the function of the priests responsible for the daily ritual of the tabernacle, which were limited to the sons of Aaron (Num. 3:3–4). This segmentation of duties would continue when Israel entered the Promised Land. The movements of the tabernacle are known only incidentally, but it is present at Shiloh and Gibeon before being placed permanently inside the temple (Josh. 18:1; 19:51; 1 Chron. 16:39–40). The fundraising of Joash includes provision for the tent of the testimony (2 Chron. 24:6). Whatever the fortunes of the tabernacle, the role of the Levites would change after settlement in the Promised Land. Their duties may be assumed to have been transferred to the various local places of worship Israel establishes before the centralization prescribed in Deuteronomy. Limiting worship to one center necessarily changes the duties of the Levites as well as their compensation. Some of these changes may be observed in the instructions Moses gives in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-183-10"></span><span id="page-183-9"></span><span id="page-183-8"></span><span id="page-183-6"></span><span id="page-183-5"></span>According to Deuteronomy, the entire tribe of Levi is qualified to serve as priests; they are referred to as Levitical priests, a designation not found elsewhere in the Pentateuch. The tribe of Levi does not have an allotted territory. At the time of entry into the Promised Land, a total of forty-eight cities and surrounding territory are assigned to the Levites (Num. 35:1–8; Josh. 21:1–42). There is no mention of these cities in Deuteronomy. The function of Levitical cities changes with the coming of centralized worship, since the duties of the Levites in the countryside would be significantly reduced. The allotments for the Levites and their duties in Deuteronomy conform to their description as Levitical priests. In Deuteronomy, all the Levites are to receive the Lord's offerings by fire as their portion ("the Lord's food offerings"). These take the place of the Levites' inheritance. In the wilderness, these offerings by fire were assigned to Aaron and his descendants (Num. 18:8–10) and designated as most holy. Deuteronomy makes the distinction between those Levites serving as priests and those with the right to do so (18:6–8). It may be that Deuteronomy assumes the priestly distinctions found in the wilderness instructions, but the explanations of Deuteronomy at minimum imply changes of practice in a different time and place.

<span id="page-184-0"></span>The allotments of the priests fall into three categories (vv. 3–4): food and drink, oil, and material for clothing (the first shearing). Oil is used in eating, cooking, lighting, and healing. Since some of the endowments of food come from sacrificial animals, these could be given to the Levites only when they are serving as priests. The portion of the animal given is specified as the right foreleg (the shoulder to the knee), the jowls (including the tongue), and the maw (the fourth stomach). The priests also receive the first products of the grain, wine, oil, and wool. Giving these to the priests is a part of the confession that all these provisions are a gift from God. They are necessary as an act of faith. The service of the Lord would entail ministry at the temple in the offering of sacrifices and the pronouncing of blessings (v. 5). Moses does not here specify differing assignments from those made in the wilderness.

<span id="page-184-2"></span><span id="page-184-1"></span>Any Levite could come to Jerusalem to serve at the temple (vv. 6–8). If a Levite makes such a move, "he may have equal portions to eat." The translation of the ESV is to be followed, contrary to that of many other English versions. The right to minister at the established central place is assumed. The apodosis of the conditional sentence, according to Hebrew sentence structure, deals with their endowments, not the right to serve. They are entitled to equal shares irrespective of other income they may receive. The vocabulary concerning the sale of ancestral property is ambiguous; it may be income from Levitical properties or an inheritance.

<span id="page-184-3"></span>18:9–14 The importance of divination in the ancient world is evident in the vast number of omen collections and related cuneiform texts that have been preserved. Akkadian divination was considered a major intellectual achievement. These texts were translated into various languages, such as Elamite, Hittite, and Hurrian, and offer an abundance of material concerning the various techniques of divination. These all represent a means of communication with forces that shape the individual as well as the group. Such information was a means of averting evil or harm. Two techniques are known in Mesopotamia: operational and magical. Communication could take place through a binary answer (yes or no) or through a code accepted by both the deity and the diviner. In operational divination, answers could come through the spreading of oil poured into water or through the shape of smoke emitted from a censer. Magical techniques are effects of natural phenomena: wind, thunder, movements of stars, or effects on the external or internal features of animals. Records were kept of unusual acts of animals or happenings in the sky and were developed into a science for understanding their significance for humans. The gods could be entreated to write their message within the entrails of an animal. The internal organs of the selected animals would then be examined for any unusual features (a process known as extispicy), all of which could be determined through the maintenance of detailed records. Many signs are referred

to as "liver omens," since the liver was considered the seat of the emotions. These constitute the largest number of omen texts by far. Dream interpretations are quite rare among Akkadian tablets, and shamanism (communication with spirits) is unknown. Mesopotamia is famed for the royal art of astrology, which goes back to the Old Babylonian period and is very prominent in the library of Assurbanipal. Horoscopes, which deal with one's date of birth, are only known much later, from the fifth to the third centuries BC.

<span id="page-185-0"></span>Deuteronomy considers all forms of divination to be an abomination. Moses does not describe specific methods of receiving messages from other powers; all are condemned under the general prohibition of "divination" (v. 10). The specific practices of the various terms are never given and are not self-evident. The term "tells fortunes" usually refers to clouds (Hb. *ʿnn*); some sign is used as an omen. "Interprets omens" derives from a root that ordinarily means snake (*nahash*) and refers to some means of seeking signs. "Sorcerer" (*keshef*) in Akkadian refers to one who practices witchcraft, someone who uses spells, charms, or incantations to manipulate people. "Charmer" translates the word *heber* ("bind"); a similar Akkadian word means to bind magically as a type of sorcery. Necromancy is the practice of making inquiry through the spirits of deceased persons. This was done through a "medium" know in Hebrew as an *ʾob*. Consultations with the dead were also made through a *yiddeʿoni* ("necromancer"), someone familiar with spirits. These terms are sometimes translated interchangeably.

Distinct from all these practices is one who "burns his son or his daughter as an offering." The Hebrew expression means to "pass through the fire" (cf. ESV mg.).46 It may be that child sacrifice was practiced in Israel, as it certainly was among the Moabites. But human sacrifice is not specifically connoted by this expression. The archaeological and linguistic evidence indicates that this was a ritual cremation that took place at a *tophet*, a place outside the city wall sometimes used for special status burials. Those buried at these places were primarily premature, stillborn, or very young infants. The ritual cremation of a deceased child was a kind of human sacrifice that at least in some cases marked dedication to a deity (Jer. 32:35; 2 Kings 16:3; 17:17; 21:6; 23:10). The practice is related to dedication to Molech or the exercise of divination.

<span id="page-185-3"></span><span id="page-185-2"></span><span id="page-185-1"></span>18:15–22 Guidance for life in Israel comes through the God of the covenant. He does not speak through any of the means used by the nations. God reveals himself to Israel through the Torah mediated through Moses. Israel will have need for revelation once Moses is no longer with them. Thus he makes provision for his office to continue through prophets like himself.

Prophecy is the only means of mediating the divine word. Moses recalls the experience of Mount Sinai, where the people were terrified at the divine appearance. God approved of their request for a mediator. Those who succeed Moses in

<sup>46</sup> Analysis of the significance of the biblical expression "pass through the fire" may be found in Ziony Zevit, *The Religions of Ancient Israel: A Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches* (London: Continuum, 2001), 549–552.

this office will not be inferior in authority, though Moses holds a unique status as the prophet of Israel. Any Israelite who disregards prophetic authority will be held accountable. In addition, anyone who speaks presumptively as a prophet but leads people away from the revelation of Moses must be put to death. A prophet might speak falsely in two different ways (Deut. 18:20): (1) a word might be spoken that God has not given, or (2) a prophecy might be given in the name of other gods.

<span id="page-186-2"></span>Any prophets who contradicts the revelation received at Sinai must immediately be identified as false. Those who prophesy on other matters and do not use any of the usual methods of divination could not be identified immediately. The test of a true prophet is that his words must also stand the test of time. Later prophets such as Isaiah serve more as reformers seeking to bring the people back to the covenant. Isaiah's prophecy of total exile did not come true in his lifetime, but even in his lifetime he could be recognized as one who truly spoke the word of God. Other prophecies did come true in his lifetime, such as the ending of the Assyrian siege in the days of Hezekiah.

<span id="page-186-1"></span><span id="page-186-0"></span>The practice of divination in Israel is dangerous because it is a means of exercising supernatural power. The Egyptian magicians were able to duplicate the signs Moses gave (Ex. 7:8–11). Israel is not to rely upon such powers. Their loyalty is to be with Yahweh exclusively (Deut. 18:13). Consulting with the spirits of the dead is also a denial of trust in God by seeking guidance from some other authority.

#### *Response*

Postmodern questions begin with authentication of what is believed to be true. What validates the choice of belief held by an individual or society? In practice, controlling belief systems are determined simply by power. The epistemological assertion of Western societies demands the irrational proposition that no knowledge is possible outside of what is perceptible by the independent human mind and the senses. If this is denied in theory, it is nevertheless invariably held in practice. Evidence of realities outside of phenomena that can be perceived by the senses is undeniable. Postmodernist denial stems from the hubris of humans' adamantly asserting the nonexistence of anything greater than themselves. The ancients might have elevated themselves to the status of deity, but they were never so irrational as to think that no knowledge or being could exist outside of what they could perceive. The only question was how to access such knowledge, since it would be vital to human well-being. In Israel, the only legitimate means of receiving the knowledge necessary for human decision and conduct was revelation through a prophet in the tradition of Moses. This was authenticated by the revelatory encounter at Mount Sinai, where the Holy One chose in mercy to reveal himself in a sensory manner through darkness, lightning, the sound of a voice, and a written document.

The holy was communicated and taught through the practice of ritual, which is appropriately modified according to circumstance. Transformation enables the goal of the confession and way of life to be achieved in changing situations. Centralization was the right step for the temple confessions of Israel. It brought cohesion to the disparate parts of the country and unified the tribes in one single assembly. This had not been possible from the time of the wilderness until the coming of the kingdom. Moses anticipates this necessity; his instructions in covenant renewal reflect differing emphases than those of earlier times, with changes in practice. This is not denial of the preceding but rather empowering continuation. Christian rituals of baptism and communion are themselves modifications of previous rituals, through Christ's command, that inform the new practices so that their significance can be fully understood. It is unfortunate that much of Christian preaching makes no reference to the antecedents from which these practices emerged and the ways in which they continue the confessions of the past.

<span id="page-187-3"></span><span id="page-187-2"></span><span id="page-187-1"></span>The revelation received by Moses at Sinai was unique. There was no other prophet like him, due to this circumstance (Deut. 34:10). Moses was more than a prophet; he was a man uniquely called by God. Sinai was the great revelatory moment in the history of Israel. The belief continued, however, that there would be a prophet like Moses. In his sermon at the healing of a lame man, Peter calls for repentance for cleansing of sin, saying that this would make possible the times of renewal signified by this miracle (Acts 3:19–23). This renewal would come through Jesus, the one who had suffered for them and the fulfillment of the prophet like Moses, who would arise from the people. Failure to trust him would constitute removal from the congregation. For Peter, Mount Sinai and the Mount of Transfiguration (Luke 9:28–32) are the two great moments authenticating divine revelation, the first established by Moses and the second by a prophet like Moses (2 Pet. 1:16–18). All other revelation of any time is subordinated to these two great revelatory periods. All other revelation is more circumstantial, it does not add to the truth of what has been received. Jesus does not repeat the truth of Moses; it remains forever necessary, but Jesus does fulfill it in the new covenant, which establishes forever the relationship of God with his people.

19"When the Lord your God cuts off the nations whose land the Lord your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses, **<sup>2</sup>** you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess. **<sup>3</sup>**You shall measure the distances*<sup>1</sup>* and divide into three parts the area of the land that the Lord your God gives you as a possession, so that any manslayer can flee to them.

If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past— **<sup>5</sup>** as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he may flee to one of these cities and live, **<sup>6</sup>** lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past. **7**Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities. **8**And if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers— **9**provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the Lord your God and by walking ever in his ways—then you shall add three other cities to these three, **<sup>10</sup>** lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.

#### *Section Overview: Protection of Life, Land, and Truth*

<span id="page-188-0"></span>The Ten Words given at Mount Sinai stipulated the life values that were to be upheld if the requirement of the covenant to love and fear God were to be observed. These began with a confession of Yahweh as holy, separate from the created order of the common but ever present within it to impart and sustain life. This is the significance of the confession that there is no other God (Deut. 4:35, 39); all other supposed gods or powers are fully subordinate to the Creator, who belongs to another order. The exposition of this Torah begins with the practices and rituals through which confession of such a God will be observed; it goes on to make provision for officials to enable this confession to be expressed communally.

<span id="page-189-4"></span>The section of exposition that begins at chapter 19 moves on to the practice of the stipulated values in daily life. The values for living in covenant are given in four statements concerning life, family, property, and relationships. These are expressed in succinct lucidity: you shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, and you shall not bear false witness (5:20). This chapter takes up the closely related questions of protecting life, family, property, and truth in the exercise of covenant as it is to be practiced by individuals and clans. An important question in the protection of life concerns accidental homicide. Cities of asylum are necessary to protect those charged with murder. Land is the most fundamental of properties to be protected, as is established in this chapter. Finally, in the case of disputes, a procedure is needed for determining the truth of one person's claims when contradicted by another's. As the exposition proceeds to the values of the Ten Words governing community relations, it begins with provisions to protect these basic values essential to integrity and peace within family and clan life.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-189-5"></span>19:1–7 State law enforcement was not part of civil provisions in ancient societies. Such a force is the luxury of more affluent societies, in which provision for life essentials can be accomplished by a much smaller number of people. Protection at the community level came through family association, by which the kinship group was the primary defender for violations of life. It was the responsibility of a near relative to restore relations within the tribe. This person is referred to as a *goʾel*, a Hebrew word that carries the sense of restoration or redemption, such as the purchase of property by a relative when it has been sold for debt (Lev. 25:25–34). In the case of a death, the restoration of relations is carried out by a near relative referred to as a *goʾel haddam*, generally translated "avenger of blood" (Deut. 19:6).

<span id="page-189-7"></span><span id="page-189-6"></span><span id="page-189-3"></span><span id="page-189-2"></span><span id="page-189-1"></span><span id="page-189-0"></span>Murder was dealt with by terminating the life of the murderer (Gen. 9:6; Ex. 21:12). In the absence of prisons, this is the only way to avoid repeat offences. The avenging of murder should not be interpreted as simple revenge, for vengeance belongs to God alone, not to the individual Israelite (Lev. 19:18). Nevertheless, among family members, feelings for revenge could be present (Deut. 19:6), creating a vengeful situation. The avenger need not be an immediate family member. In the case of a brother killing a brother, other members of the clan would seek to avenge the matter (2 Sam. 14:7, 11). The avenging of murder was a responsibility quite apart from personal feelings one might have on the matter. In the case of accidental homicide, provision was to be made for refuge to protect the innocent person and prevent a situation of continued retaliation.

<span id="page-190-7"></span>Moses introduced cities of refugee in the first address to the people after the initial conquest of the Transjordan (Deut. 4:41–43). Three cities are named, distributed geographically from south to north as a place of asylum. In the exposition of this Torah, Moses provides the details of the designation of these cities and their function. The locations are determined by a survey of the land, dividing it into three areas; distance is the criterion for selection, not tribal affiliation. The purpose of these cities is to protect the innocent person, as explained by the example of a neighbor's accidental death while cutting trees (19:5). The reason for situating the cities geographically is to provide for accessibility so the innocent person could escape and receive a proper trial.

<span id="page-190-9"></span><span id="page-190-8"></span>19:8–10 These verses are a reminder that the promises of God are yet to be fulfilled, for with the expansion of the land would be the need for additional cities of asylum. The promises to the patriarchs could be fulfilled only on the condition that the Israelites love God according to the terms of the covenant. To this end, it is important for revenge and killing of the innocent to be prevented. Three additional places of refuge are to be added once the land is fully occupied in order to protect the innocent and prevent the guilt of murder.

<span id="page-190-5"></span><span id="page-190-4"></span><span id="page-190-2"></span>Numbers 35 further explains that these places of refuge are Levitical cities given the technical designation *miqlat*. The Hebrew root *qalat* means "to take up, harbor."47 Accused individuals will find safety in those cities until they appear before a general assembly (*ʿedah*, "congregation") to face trial (Num. 35:12). If innocent, they will be returned to the city of refuge (Num. 35:25). They will remain there until the death of the high priest. This regulation is explained by the rule of biblical law that there can be no ransom or commutation for homicide. All human life is to be protected with equal sanctity, since all belong to God. The life of a slave is as sacred as any other's; if a slave dies at the hands of a master, the death must be avenged (Ex. 21:20). If death occurs in a struggle, life must be given for life (Ex. 21:23). No ransom can be received for the accidental death of another person (Num. 35:32–34). In the case of accidental death, the manslayer must live in the city of asylum until the chance death of the high priest, signifying a penalty equal to the crime.48 This may have been a time of a general amnesty; none of this is specified in Deuteronomy. Practices regarding the function of asylum cities may have changed over time, or they may have varied depending on the circumstances of each situation.

<span id="page-190-10"></span><span id="page-190-6"></span><span id="page-190-1"></span><span id="page-190-0"></span>19:11–13 Moses makes clear that the possibility of asylum for the accidental death of another human does not exist for intentional killing. The blood of the slain is

The elders, representative leaders of the tribe, act on behalf of the victim's family to bring the guilty person from the city of refuge for judgment. No mercy is possible in such cases. The sanctity of individuals made as God's image (Gen. 9:6) and the necessary protection of the community from further violations of life allow for no exceptions. Execution of the murderer falls to the clan, as it is its responsibility to protect its own family members. Failure to execute such judgment brings the blood of the victim upon the community and becomes a violation of the covenant made with God.

<span id="page-191-4"></span><span id="page-191-2"></span>19:14 As Moses taught in the words of the covenant at Sinai, property is closely related to life, since life depends on material sustenance. Land is the most fundamental of properties, for all acquisition in some manner depends on land. The boundaries of the tribes were set by Moses on the entrance to the land as determined by God in the casting of lots (Num. 26:53–56). The allotment given to each family unit was called its "inheritance" (Hb. *nahalah*). This ancestral inheritance is to be inviolable to each family. Wisdom writings warn against this violation in the context of plundering the poor or making land the security for risky or bad loans (Prov. 22:22–28).49 Theft by moving a boundary marker was regarded as an insidious sin in all ancient societies.

<span id="page-191-7"></span><span id="page-191-5"></span>19:15–21 False accusations are a violation of life as destructive as the stealing of property. The ninth word of Moses at the mountain warns against falsifying testimony against another person. In this context a false testimony could result in execution, which would be the equivalent of taking a life. At minimum, two or three witnesses are required in the case of a dispute, since accountability for deliberate deception and safeguards against faulty perception are both needed.

<span id="page-191-3"></span>Parties to the dispute are to appear before the Lord, an expression that often means going to the sanctuary. This is hardly the meaning intended in this instance, in that not all cases would be brought to the one central location envisioned by Deuteronomy. As indicated in the discussion on the festivals (e.g., Deut. 6:8), assemblies not involving sacrificial food took place apart from the temple. Whatever the location, the judges are God's representatives, so that appearing before them is to be in the Lord's presence.

A false witness is to be punished with the penalty that would have been laid on the accused. Penalties are to be carried out in a just fashion, the punishment being appropriate to the crime. The regulation "eye for an eye," commonly called "lex talionis" (the law of retaliation), is to be executed by means of monetary payment except in the case of murder. This may be seen in the example of damage done to a fetus in Exodus 21:22–25, where a fine is specified. A literal application of the law would be impossible in that case, since a fetus could not be demanded from the assailant. Many situations would be similar, such as blasphemy (Lev.

<span id="page-191-6"></span><span id="page-191-1"></span><sup>49</sup> This portion of Proverbs is part of the thirty sayings of the wise (22:17–24:34), which bear a close relationship to the thirty sayings of the Egyptian "Instruction of Amenemope," a work in which this prohibition is found in saying 6.

<span id="page-192-0"></span>24:10–16). The classic expression of the lex talionis is given as a general principle; it is not a prescription for particular cases or a rule naming all applicable cases. It is probably adopted from standard legal formulations as a principle of justice for the court. The standard of justice is reparation for damage done. In the case of a false witness, the reparation would follow this rule. The court would be required to administer the penalty to a false witness. In the case of murder, the offense is against the court, so it is only logical that the penalty the court would administer to the guilty would be applied to a false witness.

#### *Response*

Violence is a problem in every society. We tend to divide society into good and bad individuals according to the legal criteria held by a society, but matters are never that simple. The division between good and bad is not found between individuals but lies somewhere within each individual. A south Boston mobster nicknamed Whitey Bulger was beaten to death in prison in a revenge killing. The *Economist*'s November 8, 2018, obituary under the headline "The Business of Crime," stated that words like *good* and *bad* plagued him. He was bad because he was a racketeer, an extortionist (though "rent collector" was the term he preferred), an arms trafficker, and a mobster. His first spree of robberies in 1955 was bad in the classic style, bursting into banks with a pistol in each hand and fleeing with his girlfriend in a getaway car. His brother, William, held an eighteen-year tenure as president of the Massachusetts senate, the longest in the history of that institution. According to the *New York Times*, William Bulger lost his job at a university for refusing to testify against his brother.50 He was intensely loyal to his older brother and lived next door to a house owned by one of his brother's partnersin-crime, where the gang hatched plots, stored an arsenal of weapons, and committed murders. How do the words *good* and *bad* apply to the two brothers? They have left very different legacies. According to law one was good, responsible for crafting many good laws, while the other lived a life in perpetual violation of the law. But the younger brother implicitly was a false witness in the sense that he refused to divulge information vital to the prevention of crime. Both brothers without question thought of themselves as good; they just happened to have a very different kind of vocation.

Society will never rid itself of such problems of violence, because it cannot deal with the conundrum of the human personality. Humans are not shaped and controlled; though they may be influenced in a whole variety of ways, there is no predicting the result various influences may have. The two Bulger brothers grew up in the same family and community, with similar opportunities, but had somewhat contrasting careers. What was the difference between them? According to each of them, it would appear they did not necessarily think there was much of one. It could be argued that they were right in such an assessment. The differences

<sup>50</sup> Katharine Q. Seelye, "Sticking by a Murderous Brother, and Paying for It Dearly," *New York Times*, November 25, 2013.

between individual people are generally much less than perceived by the individuals concerned.

<span id="page-193-1"></span><span id="page-193-0"></span>The reality is that the Bible realistically makes provision for control of violence. Violence leads to the reversal of creation in the coming of the flood in Genesis 6–8. The difference after the flood is a provision for violence in Genesis 9:5–6 that has the potential to prevent society from self-destructing. That provision is what we call human government. Human government cannot solve human problems, but it does have a role in protecting victims, even a victim guilty of manslaughter through an accident such as a flying iron (Deut. 19:5). This role of government should be taken with utmost seriousness. However, the notion that governments have the capacity to remove violence from societies should always be treated with appropriate skepticism.

<span id="page-193-2"></span>Control of violence is not the same thing as justice in biblical terms. Here we see a complete confusion of terminology in contemporary society. The legal systems of most societies mete out penalties that are called justice, but penalties do not constitute justice. Penalties are punishment for damage done as part of the task of minimizing violence. Justice restores losses to an individual who has suffered as a result of violence. In the case of property or even bodily injury, the so-called lex talionis of this chapter is a useful guide in providing justice. But in the case of loss of life it is not relevant. Murder as a result of a planned scheme must not be allowed to repeat; the penalty is to forfeit the life of the murderer. Lesser penalties apply in other cases, such as accidental manslaughter, but in these cases the law recognizes that the person committing homicide is also partly the victim.

20"When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them, for the Lord your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. **2**And when you draw near to the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people **<sup>3</sup>** and shall say to them, 'Hear, O Israel, today you are drawing near for battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint.

#### *Section Overview: Regulations in Warfare*

<span id="page-194-0"></span>Deuteronomy anticipates the time in which Israel will be a state with a king and with control over its territory. The wars of entrance to the Promised Land are depicted as a judgment against the Canaanites whose sins were beyond mercy (Gen. 15:16; Lev. 18:24–25; 20:23–24). Israel cannot cohabit with the nations God has judged. Their mandate is to displace these nations and place them under the judgment of God's domain (Deut. 20:16–17). But not all wars fall into this category. War is part of the human situation. As the Preacher observes in Ecclesiastes 3:8, war is one of the times that occur in the course human life.

<span id="page-194-3"></span><span id="page-194-2"></span>War is responsible for the worst of evils in human society. War not only leads to the death of combatants and innocent civilians and the destruction of civilian and national property, but also frequently results in famine and other evils.51 The regulations of Deuteronomy 20 are to minimize the destruction of life and property of conquered people and territory. The provisions of this chapter fall

In dealing with matters of justice and maintaining order, Moses prescribes conduct in military matters. Other specific examples of dealing with situations arising in warfare are taken up in association with other moral issues and values.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-195-2"></span><span id="page-195-1"></span>20:1–4 Instructions for warfare begin with an exhortation concerning the role of the military: success is always dependent on God, who fights for his people. Israel does not conduct wars on God's behalf; rather, God cares and provides for his people when they come under the attack of other nations God has judged. This is the proper definition of "holy war," as it is sometimes called. The concept is that God provides victory, not that a nation fights for God. It is important to have a well-prepared military, but military success is always dependent on God as the warrior who fights for his people. The model given is that of God's bringing Israel out of Egypt (v. 1) when Israel did not have an organized military force. God took up the military attack against Pharaoh, finally sinking his armies in the Reed Sea (Ex. 15:1–18). If this is the example of divine warfare, an army should not be necessary at all. But just as the gift of the land did not come about without combat, as Moses reminded Israel in his first sermon, life in the land will also involve war. Most often the enemy will be overwhelming, as was the case with entrance into the Promised Land. But Israel must never fear, because military success is never dependent on the superiority of military forces. And warfare should never be engaged apart from a divine mandate for protection of the covenant people. If warfare is under God's command, no opposing army should be a cause of terror.

<span id="page-195-7"></span><span id="page-195-4"></span><span id="page-195-0"></span>The priests are part of the military operations, as they represent God to the army. Their task is to provide the assurance that God is with them in battle. This is stated first as the central requirement for engagement in warfare. In actual practice, the priest would speak to the army once it had been recruited and was about to engage in battle, as explained in verse 2. Other armies would depend on the power of chariots and horses (v. 1), but Israel would call on the name of the Lord (Ps. 20:7–9). Dependence on military weapons would result in failure; only the Lord could protect his king and the nation. In one outstanding example, Jehoshaphat is overwhelmed by a coalition of kings against him (2 Chron.

<span id="page-196-6"></span><span id="page-196-5"></span>20:1–22). He seeks the Lord and assembles his army. His prayer is answered with a prophetic declaration through a Levite (2 Chron. 20:14–17). The Levite explains the route of the attack but exhorts the army not to engage in battle and instead to wait for the salvation of the Lord. In response, Jehoshaphat assembles a Levitical choir at the head of his army to engage the superior forces. Before the opposing army arrives at the scene of battle, its whole coalition collapses into fighting each other. Israel arrives to gather up the spoils. This would not be the procedure of every battle, but it exemplifies the practice Moses explains here. Once the army is assembled, the priests address them with the declaration that, unless the Lord fights for them, their cause is lost. But, conversely, if God is on their side, they cannot lose.

<span id="page-196-1"></span>20:5–9 The regulations for mobilizing a voluntary army are motivated by humanitarian concerns. The purpose is to ensure minimal disruption of civilian life. Civilian officials rather than military generals are responsible for the recruitment of the army. Deferments allow for the provision of establishing a home, farm, or family. These are fundamental to community function and the basic entitlement of every person. The opportunity to participate in these basic rights must not be jeopardized. In the case of establishing a family, a marriage has not been consummated, but the bridal price has been paid. In ancient practice this payment was for the benefit of the wife and was the equivalent of her inheritance. Once payment was made, the marriage was initiated, known as "inchoate marriage."52 This was not an engagement but the beginning of a marriage; any violations to the relationship were treated as violations of a marriage (Deut. 22:23–24). A final reason for deferment was for the benefit of the army; any individual not prepared to engage in warfare should not join, as doing so would demoralize the other troops.

<span id="page-196-3"></span>Once membership of the army had been determined by civilian officials, the military officers would take charge. The army generals would be appointed, indicating that the army would be marshaled for specific threats. These are not regulations for a standing force. It is not specified who appoints the army leaders, but it would be officials of higher authority. The procedure may follow the description of the appointment of judges (1:15), in which heads of tribes are appointed based on their wisdom and reputation, and then those heads appoint leaders referred to as chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. Those chiefs are civilians, while these are to be temporary military leaders.

<span id="page-196-2"></span><span id="page-196-0"></span>20:10–14 The general rule in warfare is to seek terms of peace without engaging in battle. If a city accepts terms of surrender, its citizens are not harmed but become part of a state labor force. Solomon uses such a conscripted labor force from the native Canaanite peoples who live as subordinates after the conquest (1 Kings 9:20–21). These laborers are distinguished from the temporary conscriptions

<span id="page-196-4"></span><sup>52</sup> For a full discussion of ancient Near Eastern marriage practice that contains more detail than the Bible cf. Raymond Westbrook, "The Prohibition on Restoration of Marriage in Deuteronomy 24:1–4," in *Studies in Bible*, ed. Sara Japhet, ScrHier 31 (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1986), 387–405.

<span id="page-197-4"></span>Solomon lays on the Israelites to construct buildings (1 Kings 5:13–14). Israelites will never be subject to continuous servitude but will temporarily serve the state, as in the military service described here or in temporary service for building projects. If a city does not accept terms of peace, it will be dealt with more harshly. Its soldiers, who have the potential to lead in a future rebellion, are to be dispatched. The women and children become Israelite servants, though in some cases they might be taken as wives. All the property of the city is taken by the Israelites.

<span id="page-197-2"></span><span id="page-197-1"></span>20:15–18 The inhabitants of Canaan fall under the judgment of the *kherem*, which means that they are removed entirely from the common. The people are put to death because they stand under final divine judgment. Their time of accountability has come; their continuing presence would be a danger to the covenant Israel has with God. Their practices in relation to their gods are an abomination to Israel (18:9–13). This is not an ethnic matter. Israelite cities that adopt abominable Canaanite practices are treated the same way (13:12–16). This regulation is given as a theological reality. Canaanites must be purged so that the covenant of Israel is not compromised with their practices. It is only in select cities such as Jericho that extermination of people and property is carried out in actual practice.

<span id="page-197-3"></span><span id="page-197-0"></span>20:19–20 It is common practice in warfare to destroy the infrastructure of invaded territory in order to reduce the resources for resistance. Ancient warfare often involved a long duration of time. Cities were fortified and generally wellsupplied in preparation for war. Siege works (Hb. *matsor*) generally included a wall or fortification built around the city by an attacking army to blockade it from receiving food, military supplies, or soldiers and to protect the attacking army from resistance within the city. This practice was used in Nebuchadnezzar's attack against Jerusalem, which led to its eventual fall. He built a siege wall around the city, technically called *dayeq* (a loan word from the Akkadian *dajjiqu*), and attacked the city for three years (from the ninth to twelfth years of King Zedekiah). By the end of the third year, the city was breached because of famine (2 Kings 25:1–3). A besieging army might use a long siege to threaten a city by destroying its fruit trees and food supply. These regulations prevent such tactics, though they do allow for cutting down non-fruit-bearing trees for building the siege wall. The rationale is the well-being of the tree. Its role in military action cannot be equated with the soldiers'. The statement that trees are not human is both creational and humanitarian. Humans depend on creation; it is to be respected, as it belongs to God, who permits its use by humans.

#### <span id="page-197-5"></span>*Response*

Humans decry the evils of war, but humans alone are the cause of war. Humans are completely incapable of preventing war. There are always those willing to die or, more likely, willing to send others to their deaths in order to preserve power or overthrow it. War is an intractable problem of human society. Human history in every human society is a story of war.

<span id="page-198-0"></span>War not only causes the deaths of soldiers, making them and their families its immediate victims, but also has other consequences that bring about death. In ancient warfare this was famine, as illustrated in the narrative of the Aramean siege against Samaria (2 Kings 6:24–31). The king of Israel, presumably Ahab, is confronted by a woman whose complaint is that she has given her son for food, but now her neighbor has hidden the child she agreed to give up for food. This is not only an ancient problem. One of the most egregious famines in human history followed the Great War (1914–1918), the "war to end all wars." Over four million Ukrainian peasants were deliberately starved to death by Stalin in 1932–1933 in his paranoia over an anticipated attack of capitalist powers.53 The one hundredth anniversary of the First World War, which left eleven million combatants dead, has produced two forensic studies of the causes of this war. Margaret MacMillan, an Oxford scholar, in *The War That Ended Peace* (2013) holds Germany primarily responsible for the war. Christopher Clark, a Cambridge scholar, in *The Sleepwalkers* (2012) charges the Balkans with igniting the war. Each work is a tour de force; Clark's book has sold three hundred thousand copies in seventeen languages.54

There were no reasons for this war. The war had one outcome of dubious significance: the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War as an Instrument of Policy (a.k.a. the Kellogg-Briand Pact, named, respectively, after the foreign ministers of the United States and France). This agreement was signed by more than fifty countries, including all the great powers, in Paris in 1928. The goal of this treaty—to punish all wars of aggression, generally with economic sanctions—was at best of limited effect.55 Enforcement, as might be expected, proved impossible. The League of Nations could not stem the tide of militarism that followed, including its apotheosis in the Second World War. It is not that the pact was without effect. The organization of peace that followed the second war returned most of the land conquered, excepting the Soviet Union. The Nuremberg Trials established the principle that waging aggressive war was a criminal act, resulting in punishment for some of Hitler's henchmen.

It remains to be seen whether this policy will be effective in preventing future international wars, but it has had the effect of spawning countless intranational wars. Fractious countries do not need to fear international intervention, which would result in the loss of their power. Death and violence of war have been rampant in the seventy years since. The authors of *The Internationalists* still argue that the Kellogg-Briand Pact is better than the alternatives and laud the architects who brought it into being. Whatever the merits of the pact, it has enabled innumerable

<sup>53</sup> This history has been reviewed again by Anne Applebaum, *Red Famine: Stalin's War on Ukraine* (New York: Doubleday, 2017). For a critical review from a Communist perspective cf. Sheila Fitzpatrick, "Red Famine by Anne Applebaum Review—Did Stalin Deliberately Let Ukraine Starve?," *The Guardian*, August 25, 2017, Book of the Day. Soviet leaders had worked themselves into a frenzy over presumed imminent attack from capitalist powers and suspected *kulaks* (small farmers in Ukraine), class enemies who would welcome such an invasion. 54 For a review of these two studies cf.

wars, and the principles themselves are under siege, as exemplified in the Russian takeover of Crimea (2014).

As with violence within societies, wars will continue to be fought between societies. The best that is possible is to attempt to ameliorate the effects of war, as regulated in this chapter. War raises other questions for Christians. Since the highest commitment of a Christian is to a kingdom not of this world, the question becomes the level of commitment that should be made to the country of which one is a citizen. Christians in countries such Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, or Iraq suffer mercilessly through war irrespective of their resolve to live as peacefully as possible. They are targeted by various warring factions within their countries. The one responsibility all Christians have is to pray for peace—not simply the cessation of war but that families destroyed by war may find the peace of God that passes understanding. War is a continuous reminder to pray for the appearance of the rider on the great white horse (Rev. 19:11–16), who smites the nations with the (s)word of his mouth, whose sash reads "King of kings and Lord of lords."

### <span id="page-199-2"></span><span id="page-199-1"></span>DEUTERONOMY 21:1–9

21 "If in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess someone is found slain, lying in the open country, and it is not known who killed him, **<sup>2</sup>** then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure the distance to the surrounding cities. **3**And the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer that has never been worked and that has not pulled in a yoke. **4**And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. **5**Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled. **6**And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, **<sup>7</sup>** and they shall testify, 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it shed. **8**Accept atonement, O Lord, for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and do not set the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel, so that their blood guilt be atoned for.' **<sup>9</sup>** So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord."

#### *Section Overview: Community Expiation for a Homicide*

<span id="page-199-0"></span>The regulation regarding homicide is based on the premise that the ground will not receive the blood of an innocent person. His blood cries out from the ground (Gen. 4:10). The blood of the innocent person can be atoned for only by the blood <span id="page-200-2"></span><span id="page-200-1"></span>of the person who shed it (Num. 35:33). No ransom can be paid for the life of the innocent. If the blood of the innocent is not atoned for, the land is profaned and its inhabitants endangered. In the case of accidental death, the innocent life to be protected is that of the person committing accidental homicide (Deut. 19:1–7). A further problem is an unsolved murder. Such a case becomes the responsibility of the community (city) nearest to where the body is found. The significance of the rites involved in this regulation is not explained. The object of the whole procedure is clearly expressed in the prayer of the elders: "Accept atonement, O Lord, for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and do not set the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel, so that their blood guilt be atoned for" (Deut. 21:8). The primary focus of judicial and military matters has been the sanctity of human life. The section ends appropriately with provision for acknowledging a death that might otherwise be ignored. It makes emphatic the point that under no circumstance does the ground receive the blood of an innocent victim.

		- c. Atonement for Unobserved Homicide (21:1–9)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-200-3"></span>21:1–2 These verses describe the typical circumstance of an unsolved murder. Murder within a city or near to it would typically be heard and observed, but it is not likely that an unsolved murder within a city is to be excluded from this expiation ritual. Planned murder would be executed in a remote place, much as Cain drew his brother, Abel, out into a field for the purpose of killing him (Gen. 4:8). Cain's problem was that he could not hide from God, but this would be true for any murder.

<span id="page-200-0"></span>Deuteronomy further anticipates the time when Israel is living in the land. It does not make provision for a time in which Israel might be scattered and living outside the land. This is not to suggest that there should be no responsibility for an unsolved murder that takes place outside the land. Historically, Israel very quickly began to be scattered, forming communities outside the land. This regulation does not begin to stipulate procedures for all of the contingencies that might come into play, including the influence of foreign governments. The principle to be observed is that no loss of human life can be disregarded.

The case under consideration is one in which the identity of the murderer has not come to be known. The perfect tense of the Hebrew verb (*nodaʿ*) implies that, upon the discovery of a body, an investigation is undertaken to determine whether the identity of the murderer can be ascertained. Once such an investigation is completed, the responsibility for atoning for the homicide falls to the city nearest to where the body has been discovered. The city would be designated by "your elders and your judges," a process that would ensure impartiality, since these officials would be from the entire region, not the individual city.

<span id="page-201-0"></span>21:3–4 Most laws in the ancient Near East required monetary payment to the victim's family in the case of murder, which would become the responsibility of the nearest city. In Israel, however, it was impossible to redeem a human life with money or any other sacrifice. Atonement or cleansing was made through ritual actions of the elders of the city. They were to take a heifer that had never worked a field and kill it by breaking its neck in a remote area that contained water but had never been worked for a crop. The significance of these stipulations is not explained, but some points are clear. This is not a sacrifice, since priests are not involved with the killing and since the blood plays no role in the death of the animal. Furthermore, it is not like the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement, which bears away guilt. Possibilities, which need not be mutually exclusive, are that it represents the execution of the murderer, the penalty borne by the elders of the city, or the act of the murder itself. The last possibility is supported by the fact that the heifer is to be killed in a remote area resembling the sort of place premeditated homicide would take place. The reason for its being near access to water is seen in the handwashing ceremony, which seems to be a declaration that the elders are free of any culpability for the death that has taken place.

<span id="page-201-1"></span>21:5–9 The priests are involved because of their role in the judicial system in dealing with cases of lawsuit and assault. No explicit role is given to them in this procedure, but their presence may have to do with the declaration of innocence that follows. This is not given in the form of an oath, but it may have been the equivalent of one. In any case the priests, as the officials responsible for maintaining the confessions of holiness and adherence to the covenant, are present to testify to the actions of the elders. The elders' washing their hands over the carcass of the animal cannot be transference of guilt to the animal, which would take place when the animal was alive. If the killing of the animal represents the act of the murderer, then the washing of the hands over the body of the animal would signify the innocence of the elders in relation to the murder. The psalmist could say, "All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence" (Ps. 73:13).

<span id="page-201-2"></span>The washing of hands is followed by a declaration of innocence and a prayer for absolution of guilt. As with all ritual, it is the prayer of faith that is effectual in removing bloodguilt from the land. The instructions conclude with a statement of absolution. The confession and prayer for absolution will purge the guilt of the murder. This provides for the safety of the entire nation, since keeping the covenant is both an individual and a collective responsibility. Nothing suggests that this ritual absolves the guilty party of the deed; if circumstances should change and the murder can be identified, the regulations of chapter 19 would still apply.

#### *Response*

The reality that God has given life means there must be accountability for every death. This is true even for animal life, for the hunter is required to pour the blood <span id="page-202-1"></span><span id="page-202-0"></span>on the ground to signify that he has taken a life he does not own (Lev. 17:13–14). The earth's covering the blood is an acknowledgment that the life belongs to God, who has provided the animal as food. Human life is of a different order, for humans are created as God's image, to represent him (Gen. 9:5–6). Earth cannot cover the blood of a human; thus God seeks accountability from the murderer. There is a time at which accountability will be demanded for every life taken, when the blood of the slain, which was intended to be hidden by the covering of earth, will be exposed. Isaiah speaks of this as a resurrection from the dead, when God goes forth to judge all the wickedness of the earth (Isa. 26:19–21).

<span id="page-202-6"></span><span id="page-202-4"></span><span id="page-202-3"></span>The blood of the innocent dead is the primary example of the way in which God will address all wrongs that have been done. This will be the day when God destroys Leviathan, the ancient representative of death and destruction (Isa. 27:1). John describes the day of a new heavens and a new earth, when there will be no more sea, the chaotic forces of death and destruction (Rev. 21:1–2). This will be true once the sea has given up all the dead it concealed and all the dead, small and great, will stand before the throne (Rev. 20:11–15). Death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire; this is the second death.

<span id="page-202-5"></span>Contemporary societies have a police force that is made responsible for every death that occurs. In every society, even the most advanced, many deaths are unresolved, remaining in a file among the records of the force. There are unfortunately too many innocent deaths created by the state because of wrongly decided convictions—sometimes in actual taking of the victim's life, but more often in stealing that life through incarceration. In some ways the system of Israel was superior. The requirement of a minimum of two witnesses made the possibility of false conviction as remote as possible. All unresolved cases required a public and community acknowledgment of liability and accountability. That would bring a consciousness of the sacredness of human life to everyone for every death that occurred in a region. Such deaths are never removed from consciousness like a dead file in legal folders is, forgotten by all but the few intimate persons left to grieve.

#### *Section Overview: Family Matters*

The regulations of the covenant for civil life given by Moses up to this point have dealt with matters involving public officials and their responsibility to the community in keeping the covenant. Beginning with domestic matters in this chapter, Moses turns his attention to individuals, addressing private matters within the family and relations with immediate neighbors.

In this Torah Moses directly addresses issues of power. All power belongs to God, but his rule is mediated through human agents, such as kings, judges, priests, elders, and tribal chiefs. These are ordained for the purpose of maintaining moral order. Leaders are to be respected, beginning with the honor children must give their parents, as declared in word five. The most immediate experience of power in the life of every individual is within the household. Heads of households are to view the family as an extension of their own life. Their own well-being depended on the orderly function of their household and on good relations with the households around them.

<span id="page-203-3"></span><span id="page-203-2"></span><span id="page-203-1"></span><span id="page-203-0"></span>Several regulations in the section on household matters (21:10–25:19) give special attention to the support and protection of women. These include a wife acquired through war (Deut. 21:10–14), the heritage of a wife who is less loved (21:15–17), the protection of a wife who is disliked (22:13–21), protection of a divorced woman and her possessions from the claims of a former husband (24:1–4), <span id="page-204-4"></span><span id="page-204-3"></span>protection of a new bride when her husband is summoned to war (24:5), and provision for a woman widowed before her children have come into their inheritance (25:5–10). These passages address generally the concerns of Moses to provide for those who are dependent, but these cases are specifically directed to the responsibility of fathers, who serve as rulers of their households. Fathers function in a role of authority in their families, which always presents the danger of acting in self-interest in the exercise of that authority to the neglect of one's corresponding responsibilities.

Family matters addressed in this chapter begin with procedures for a man who wishes to marry a woman taken captive in war. This is a natural location as a sequel to the section dealing with procedures for war. This section ends with the possibility of the woman being disliked as a wife, which forms a segue to the next section, dealing with the rights of a firstborn son of a wife who is disliked. The third section deals with the problem of a recalcitrant son who runs out of control. This topic is linked by the subject of the limits of the authority a father has over a child. The execution of a rebellious son is followed by the regulation on not delaying beyond the end of the day the disposal of the body of someone executed.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-204-2"></span><span id="page-204-1"></span>21:10–14 The subject of a woman taken in war is placed among the family matters because the instructions concern marriage, not the circumstances of war. Normally, persons taken captive in war become servants to their captors, as assumed in the previous chapter (20:14), but there could be a circumstance in which a man would wish to take a marriageable woman as his own wife. She would then hold a completely different status, as explained in these verses. She must be given time to mourn her loss and adjust to her new situation. If the marriage fails—a possibility, given the cultural differences that would necessarily create stress in the relationship—the woman cannot be treated as a slave or traded as property. She becomes a free woman, with the same cultural status as all other citizens. There is no procedure for conversion, which apparently was not expected—although, according to the provisions for redemption in Exodus 12:43–51, the woman would be entitled to enter the covenant if that was her desire.

<span id="page-204-0"></span>Certain rituals are prescribed to indicate the woman's change of status and introduction to a new way of life. There is no indication concerning these rituals' <span id="page-205-1"></span>significance, other than that the change of garment indicates she is no longer a captive. The trimming of the hair and nails and the change of garment is likely a way of facilitating a radical transition, which includes the woman's loss of her family and heritage. She is given a month to lament her losses and prepare for a new life. Establishing sexual relations during a time of emotional trauma is not appropriate. Thirty days was the normal time of mourning (Num. 20:29; Deut. 34:8). These regulations make clear that the marriage must be for the love of the woman and not merely for her beauty. Taking the woman as a wife means she must be supported rather than engaged in service, a reality that must be maintained even if the marriage does not last. The woman can no longer be sold for services.

<span id="page-205-7"></span><span id="page-205-2"></span>21:15–17 Equality within the family is a very subjective assessment, made more difficult because emotions and personal feelings are invariably influential in the decisions made. In the case of a man with more than one wife, invariably one will be more favored than the other, which is all that is meant by the Hebrew terms *'ahab* ("loved") and *sane'* ("unloved").56 Birthright was the practice of enabling a child to carry out extra responsibilities, such as managing the estate on behalf of survivors. This is especially necessary for minors, widows, or unmarried daughters and for provision for the burial of parents and responsibility for leadership in the family. This responsibility usually fell to the eldest son of the father, though this was never followed rigidly. The father determined the designated child, just as Jacob did in the choice of Ephraim (Gen. 48:12–14). The benefit was usually a double portion. If there were only two sons, this would mean two portions of three, which is the case envisioned in this regulation.

<span id="page-205-0"></span>This provision of Moses specifically addresses the motives of a father in the case of a favored wife. The first child of a favored wife, who might well also be the younger or at least the one more recently acquired, cannot be the basis of assigning the benefits of property when the time comes for assigning the succession of property. The firstborn of the father has a certain representative status as being the sign of the father's "strength" (Deut. 21:17)—in this context his virility and ability to carry on the family line.

<span id="page-205-6"></span><span id="page-205-5"></span><span id="page-205-4"></span><span id="page-205-3"></span>21:18–21 Amid the responsibilities and limits of a patriarchal decision, Moses moves to dealing with a rebellious son. In this case both parents are involved another limitation on the role of the father, whose decision is not exclusive. The parents of the rebellious son bring him to the leaders of his city (v. 19), an indication that the child is already an adult and acting independently. The son is described as a "glutton and . . . drunkard" (v. 20). This phrase is used in Proverbs 23:20–21 to warn against association with the profligate, those addicted to wine and food. Such people live in a state of stupor and soon find themselves dispossessed and clothed in rags. They represent the incorrigible, delinquent, and selfindulgent. The dilemma of the parents of such a child is a reminder of the limits of

<span id="page-205-10"></span><span id="page-205-9"></span><span id="page-205-8"></span><sup>56</sup> In practice, one is chosen over the other; Paul quotes Malachi 1:2–3 in using the terms "loved" and "hated" for God's choice of Jacob over Esau (Rom. 9:13).

parental influence. Parents cannot determine the behavior or character of a child. Despite parents' best efforts in discipline and instruction, children may go their own way and defy everything their parents represent. Once addictions get in the way, the possibility for reform, teaching, or correction may be passed.

<span id="page-206-1"></span>Responsibility regarding family is not always the ultimate responsibility of parents. There comes a point where the behavior of a child is disruptive and out of control to the danger of themselves and others. At this point the community leaders must become involved. Obedience to parents is the first order of personal subordination under the covenant. Violation of this requirement to the point of physical violence against parents is a crime penalized by death (Ex. 21:15). In cases in which the behavior of a child has not yet reached the point of such violence, the leaders of the city must assess the situation and the dangers involved. A hearing is to be conducted in the most public area of the city so that no voice or opinion is excluded. In the worst cases, the elders have the authority to remove the child from the community. The death penalty for a disruptive and recalcitrant son is the only way to purge the community of escalating violence and decadence.

<span id="page-206-2"></span>Capital punishment is prescribed only when human life has been taken or when certain actions will lead to the loss of human life. Such is the case with the insubordination of an individual who will not abide by the ruling of the judges and priests in cases that move beyond the local level (Deut. 17:12). In the case of a rebellious son, the city makes the decision concerning the death penalty and, accordingly, accepts responsibility for the execution. The parents, whose duty it was to report the case, do not participate. The actions taken are to serve as a deterrent to others who in danger of going the same way.

<span id="page-206-5"></span><span id="page-206-3"></span>21:22–23 The exposure of the body of an executed offender was used as a deterrent in ancient times. The famous murals of Sennacherib in his palace depict his siege of the mighty fortress of Lachish, with the bodies of three soldiers exposed on poles. The purpose was to deter resistance and instigate fear in order to drive inhabitants to accept the promise of the Assyrians that everyone would have his own vine and fig tree (2 Kings 18:31). Unlike the Egyptian practice, in which the exposed body was left to be eaten by scavenging birds (Gen. 40:19), the body of an executed person in Israel was to be buried before sunset. During the conquest the bodies of the defeated Canaanite kings were hung on poles in accordance with this ancient practice (Josh. 8:29; 10:26–27) but, following this regulation, were buried before nightfall.

<span id="page-206-4"></span><span id="page-206-0"></span>The exposed body is declared to be cursed of God, but this expression is ambiguous, leaving the sense uncertain. The ancient translations (Gk., Lat., and Aram.) vary between saying that one hanged is cursed by God and that one who curses God is to be hanged. Is the body cursed because it is hanging on a pole, or is the body of an executed criminal cursed and for that reason hung on a pole in order to be reviled? The instruction is emphatic regarding the defilement of a dead body: it must be buried on the day of death. A body left exposed defiles the land. The fact that a body is cursed does not change the requirement that it be buried immediately, within the day of death.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-207-0"></span>Family, in practical terms, is never simple. The goal is simple: one man and woman covenant for a lifetime, in which they establish a relationship that provides instruction and security for their children. Jesus affirms that this is the way it is to be (Matt. 19:4–6). This goal should never be qualified to suggest that other types of relationship may be pursued as marriage's equal. But it must be frankly admitted that humans very frequently are unable to achieve this goal, for multiple reasons. Sometimes the death of a spouse intervenes. In such instances it may be most advisable for the parent not to remain single, but remarriage frequently results in blended families. This complicates matters, in terms not only of relationships with children but of inheritance among the family. In this chapter Moses deals with a common reason for blended families, or children in situations of more than one mother, which was quite inevitable in his time. War was one of the reasons this happened, but it was not uncommon that a man might have more than one wife, as there no doubt were more women than men—again, often because of war.

The goal of the instructions of this chapter is to find ways to keep all relationships as harmonious and equitable as possible. In such life situations Moses never suggests that the individuals concerned should pursue the ideal goal of Genesis at the expense of all else. In such circumstances the ideal of Genesis is not really an option, since individuals need to be cared and provided for. In modern life, courts and public law enforcement are part of the equation. These are in themselves sometimes unjust, but the situation is always exacerbated when conflict becomes the determining factor. Conflict is not avoidable in family life, but every effort should be pursued to avoid making conflict the controlling factor.

In North America, children are granted independent legal status at age eighteen, at which time the state guarantees the freedom to make one's own decisions. In biblical covenant, honor of parents continued until the death of the parent. The will of parents was to be given consideration as long as they were alive. This passage is a reminder that children choose their own course of life regardless of good parental instruction. These choices are sometimes complete insubordination to anyone. Parents can learn from this passage that community involvement in troubled family affairs can be necessary and inevitable. Churches do provide such an environment, and its importance should never be minimized. But there are situations even before a child reaches the age of independence in which the state becomes involved, especially when matters of violation of law are concerned. This is a most painful situation, but it is one that has been part of family life since earliest times, sometimes with consequences that result in death. In the most important ways, nothing has really changed.

Care for a body is a sacred matter, regardless of the person concerned. In early biblical time, bodies were exposed to serve as a warning. In later Roman times this was extended to include a living body, making crucifixion a means of <span id="page-208-3"></span><span id="page-208-2"></span><span id="page-208-0"></span>execution. This was an abhorrent practice never done in the OT. It was, however, the means of execution of the Son of God, though great care was taken to be sure the body of Christ had a proper burial. The cross, however, *was* a curse, just as the exposure of a body was a curse (Deut. 21:23). Paul uses this verse in his exposition of the gospel to speak of the "curse of the law" (Gal. 3:13). While the words Paul uses conform to this instruction of Moses with reference to the crucifixion, their sense in Paul's context is to be associated with the curses of the covenant summarized in Deuteronomy 27:26. Paul is referring to Jesus' bearing the curse that comes because of the breaking of the covenant—what he calls the "curse of the law." Jesus is not hung on the tree because he is cursed. Jesus chooses to suffer the consequences of the curses, which in Roman times was execution by hanging on a tree. All human children are under what Paul calls this "curse of the law." God's people are redeemed because Christ chose to bear that curse in hanging on a tree.

#### *Section Overview: Holiness in Household Affairs*

It may seem that the instructions for living in these verses are random and arbitrary, but they are linked not only by relationship of topic but also by various verbal connections. Most importantly, they emphasize that covenant is all about holiness, being set apart in life to represent God in daily affairs.

<span id="page-209-9"></span><span id="page-209-2"></span><span id="page-209-1"></span>The customary Hebrew root for holiness is *qadash*. This is not a part of Deuteronomic vocabulary, but it is used for Sabbath (Deut. 5:12). The adjective is used to describe the nation as holy (7:6; 14:2, 21; 26:19). A rare and unusual occurrence is found in relation to planting in a vineyard in Deuteronomy 22:9. There *tiqdash* is translated "forfeited"—the vineyard becomes set apart to God, meaning the fruit cannot be eaten. Practicing holiness is more implicit in Deuteronomy, as indicated by these instructions.

<span id="page-209-0"></span>In the absolute sense, holiness belongs to God alone, since only he is independent of the common. People and things within the common have a derivative holiness when they represent God within the created world. Israel is to be holy (Lev. 19:2), which means they are separate from other people in representing the rule of their Great Suzerain. Ordinary daily activities are an important means of manifesting this holiness. Association of wool and linen, the sowing of different crops in the same field, and the wearing of tassels were all means of expressing and symbolizing proper order within the culture of Israel. They were no less important in expressing the rule and will of God than was returning lost animals to a neighbor, providing protection from danger, or showing respect for a bird hatching her young. These practices are all associated as daily encounters distinguishing those made in the image of God, representing his presence.

<span id="page-209-8"></span><span id="page-209-7"></span><span id="page-209-6"></span><span id="page-209-5"></span><span id="page-209-4"></span><span id="page-209-3"></span>The nine laws of this section have largely to do with property, but in several different aspects. The first has to do with returning lost animals (Deut. 22:1–3), which is related to problems of theft as well as care for an animal that has gone astray. This is related to assistance of an animal that has fallen under its load (v. 4). Clothing is included among lost items (v. 3), which may be associated with proper attire (v. 5). On the road (*derek*; vv. 4, 6) one may encounter lost or struggling domestic animals but also wild animals, like a bird nesting her eggs or her young (vv. 6–7). The theme of birds may be related to the regulation concerning a roof (v. 8), where birds may often be found nesting. The theme of clothes is continued in the regulations about what is holy, such as a vineyard planted with other crops (v. 9), the mixing of linen and wool in garments (v. 11), or the wearing of tassels (v. 12). Holiness in relation to items that are mixed is an issue *in* vineyards but also in the *working* of vineyards (v. 10). These varied matters do not lack logic. They have various mnemonic associations that assist in memorization, the way almost everyone would have learned the Torah.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-210-3"></span>22:1–3 Lost animals are a common problem; there are numerous biblical references to sheep or oxen going astray. Animals do not necessarily follow the restriction of fences when such intended restrictions are in place. Stray animals must not be ignored, for both the sake of the owner and the well-being of a dependent animal. The animal must be retained by the person who finds it until its owner learns of its location and claims it. If the animal has strayed a great distance this may take some time, in which case the finder will need to provide for it alongside his other animals. Exodus 23:4 further stipulates that even if the animal belongs to one's enemy, it is to be returned.

<span id="page-210-1"></span><span id="page-210-0"></span>Recovery of lost items can be a difficult issue, as may be observed from a related law in Exodus 22:8, in which both the finder and the loser claim property as their own, and there is no real evidence to identify the actual owner. The proscription of ignoring straying animals in these verses dictates that lost items cannot be ignored: animals or any other item must be held safely until the proper owner is found.

<span id="page-210-4"></span><span id="page-210-2"></span>22:4 The requirement to help a fallen animal finds a parallel in Exodus 23:5, in which it is made explicit that the animal has fallen under the weight of a heavy load. There the beast of burden belongs to an enemy, while here it belongs to a neighbor. The action is for the benefit of the brother, but the relief provided to the animal cannot be separated from the responsibility.

<span id="page-210-5"></span>22:5 The prohibition of this verse is not restricted to the wearing of garments across genders. The Hebrew *keli* ("garment") does not have specific reference to male clothing but refers to any artifact that belongs to a man, such as a tool, a weapon, or any other item associated with males. The point of the proscription is gender distinction. While the Bible has no direct prescription concerning specific male and female roles in the function of the home, it is clear on gender identification. This is a fundamental tenet of the creation account, in which procreation is made possible only through male and female, enabling the presence of a home and the function of dominion over creation. The abhorrence referenced in this verse is the deliberate obfuscation of this distinction necessary to created order. Confusion creates conflict and the absence of shalom. The anthropological study of Mary Douglas shows that every culture has its taboos that are based on a larger system of order and organization of ideas.57 In the law of Moses these are seen not only in regulations of diet but in various other prescriptions for identifying pollution and maintaining purity. Holiness means keeping distinct categories of creation, which involves correct definition and discrimination. Rules of all acceptable sexual relationships are a part of proper order. Holiness is a matter of separating what should be kept separate, which prohibits all manner of confusion, deceit, double-dealing, or contradiction.

<span id="page-211-5"></span>22:6–7 Respect for the life of animals is a consistent theme, recurring most frequently in the prohibition of consuming the blood of an animal because it represents life. Humans must respect the fact that, in supplying their own need for food to sustain life, they are also taking life that does not belong to them. Humans and animals share a dependency as part of the common, as expressed most eloquently is Psalm 104:29: "When you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust." For this reason when a person encounters a bird fostering her young, the life of the bird must be respected.

<span id="page-211-10"></span><span id="page-211-3"></span>Birth is the essential requirement to the continuance of life, mentioned several times in connection with respect for life. A similar prohibition is found in Leviticus 22:27: "When an ox or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the Lord." The same idea is likewise expressed in the prohibition of cooking a young goat in the milk of its mother (Ex. 23:19; Deut. 14:21). Some species of animals give up their own life in order to procreate. The cost of life coming into the world of the common is great for both humans and animals and is to be acknowledged.

<span id="page-211-6"></span><span id="page-211-1"></span>22:8 The roof of an ancient house was a living space, as was every other part of the building. It could be used for storage, socializing, or resting. It could be a cool place in the evening of a hot day or a warm place in the sun on a cool day. A parapet was a necessary for protection, since a fall might be not only injurious but fatal. This is the same kind of precaution as necessary when digging a hole in the ground (Ex. 21:33–34). Death from a fall from an unprotected roof was equivalent to homicide.

The Hebrew word *qodesh* is used for items dedicated to the support of the temple (Lev. 27:1–15). Such items are designated for a limited period, after which they return to common use. When a crop is planted between the rows of a vineyard, it is regarded as being dedicated to the temple. This is the reason the proscription of Deut. 22:9 states that, in planting in a vineyard, the owner dedicates (*tiqdash*, "be forfeited") both the crop that was sown and the yield of the vineyard to the temple. It is "forfeited" as far as profit for the farmer is concerned. That this is the correct interpretation is indicated by its association with the wearing of wool and linen in the same garment (v. 11). Only the priests wore garments of mixed fabrics. The ephod of the high priest and the turban were made of purple, violet, and scarlet linen woven

<span id="page-212-6"></span><span id="page-212-3"></span><span id="page-212-2"></span><span id="page-212-1"></span>tightly into patterns (Ex. 28:6; 39:29). The turban of the high priest was bound by a violet woolen cord called a *petil* (Ex. 28:37). The brilliantly dyed wool especially distinguished the priest's garments, which were referred to in tradition as *shaʻtnez* ("cloth"; Deut. 22:11). Aaron and his sons were ordained with the binding of a tunic on their head and girded with a sash composed of wool and linen (Ex. 29:9). Only the sash of the ordinary priest's vestments was composed of wool and linen, the materials that composed the garments of the high priest and the inner curtain of the tent of meeting. The ordinary Israelite is forbidden to wear such a mixture, since it belongs to the priesthood.

In these verses Moses brings together the cropping of a vineyard with the priestly vestments in order to indicate that both are dedicated to temple use and taken out of use in the common.58 Josephus confirms this interpretation in NT times: "Let not any one of you wear a garment made of woolen and linen, for that is appointed to be for the priests alone" (*Antiquities* 4.208). These traditions of later Judaism were not late elaborations on Mosaic law but were an interpretation based on ancient understanding.

<span id="page-212-4"></span>Moses prohibits the pairing of an ox and a donkey in plowing, while in Leviticus 19:19 the interbreeding of different animal species is forbidden. This prohibition has to do with holiness as it relates to created order. God had made everything after its kind, an order of creation that Israel was to cultivate and maintain as representatives of the divine rule. It may be that in Deuteronomy a humanitarian aspect is intended in the way in which the regulation is formulated. Using an ox and a donkey as a team makes them unequally yoked. A donkey cannot be expected to pull the same weight as an ox, which it would be required to do if yoked with an ox on a single implement.

<span id="page-212-7"></span><span id="page-212-5"></span>22:12 The requirement to wear tassels on the corners of a garment is related to the commands concerning the mixing of linen and wool in garments. The requirement is elaborated in Numbers 15:37–40, where its purpose is set out by a series of verbs: "look," "remember," and "do." These summarize the pedagogic technique of the ritual system of the Torah. Sight (sensual perception) combined with memory (intellectual apprehension) translates into proper action (good deeds). The reason the tassel serves this end is explained by its composition. The tassels were also woven of wool and linen. Traditionally the tassel consists of four white threads, one of which is longer than the others. The threads are inserted into holes at the corners of the garment, folded over, and tied with a double knot. A violet or a bluepurple cord is attached to the threads at each corner, forming a resemblance to the garments of the priest. Individual Israelites do not hold the status of a priest, but Israel is to be a nation of priests (Ex. 19:6). Remnants of white linen cords and dyed woolen cords were found in the Bar Kokhba caves, showing that this was the practice of the devoted during the final days of Jewish resistance against the Romans.

<span id="page-212-0"></span><sup>58</sup> For a full discussion cf. Jacob Milgrom, "Leviticus 8 & Exodus 29," in *Leviticus 1–16*, AB (New York: Doubleday, 1991) 545–549. Discussion of the tassels (Hb. *tsitsit*) may be found in Milgrom, "Excursus 38," in *Numbers*, 410–414.

Tassels express a gradation of holiness analogous to that of the temple and its Most Holy Place, the Holy Place, the court, and then the camp. The fabric of the innermost part of the temple and of the high priest was a mix of brilliant white linen and blue-purple wool. Beyond the high priest, only the sashes of the other priests were woven this way. For ordinary Israelites, only the fringes of the garments may be made with linen and dyed wool. The tassel is the exception to the prohibition of any ordinary Israelite's wearing cloth of a mixture of linen and wool. This is a constant reminder of the order of holiness in the world of the common and a testimony to the need for all Israel to strive for the highest level of holiness in living out the covenant life under the rule of their Most Holy Suzerain, who orders the common.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-213-2"></span>The concept of representing God through temple ritual is expressed in instructions to the priesthood in Leviticus 10:10–11. Its task is to separate between the holy and the common, the clean and the unclean, and to teach Israel the decrees God gave through Moses. The Israelites divided the world into four categories. Those items called clean may become holy through dedication, meaning they then function as part of the temple system in representing God. Items that are clean may become contaminated; they must first be purified before they can be dedicated as holy. Other items are in the category of unclean and do not qualify to be dedicated as part of the representative system of the temple. The concept of clean conforms most closely to the contemporary idea of normal, that which is in its most natural order, not blemished or injured in some way. In the temple system life is found in holiness, which affirms a relationship with the life-giver. This is particularly relevant to persons. The unclean move in a progression toward death. The clean hold the potential to move in a progression toward life. This progression is affirmed through ritual, a means of cleansing as well as dedication to be holy as the people of God.

<span id="page-213-3"></span><span id="page-213-1"></span><span id="page-213-0"></span>The Sinai covenant does not distinguish between holiness as it pertains to the symbolism of the temple and moral holiness in the conduct of the individual Israelite. There is no logic to such a distinction, because the concept of holiness is within a single system. Humans may be holy in the temple ritual if they qualify to be dedicated as priests. All humans hold potential to become holy by virtue of being made in the image of God. For this reason Israel is described as a holy nation, which they confess through the keeping of the Sabbath (Ex. 31:12–17; cf. Ex. 19:5–6). Any Israelite who has taken the vow of the covenant and kept it through confession and forgiveness belongs to the holy and represents God to the nations (e.g., Isa. 42:6). Ethical failure requires restitution, just as actions such as touching a dead body require purification to restore the status of holiness. Participation in ritual is important as a confession of faith. Apart from faith, the ritual has no merit. The effectual power of holiness is faith in God; the confessional means is participation in the covenant and its rituals. Association of what might be thought of as ritual with actions considered ethical is perfectly natural, as seen in this passage.

The Christian is in a different situation. The temple system itself has no relevance in representing God in the Christian era. Jesus Christ has become the presence of God in the world, and the church functions as his temple on earth. Relationship with Jesus Christ through faith establishes the position of being separated to God, so Christians are called saints. Holiness in the Christian life is manifest in conduct that conforms to the will of God. The process of learning that conduct is called sanctification. For the Christian, holiness is fundamentally a question of faith and morality.

Holiness in observing order within creation is relevant in the present time. Creation order has not changed, and it is the task of those who represent God to recognize and affirm it. Gender distinctions will always be the means of perpetuating human life and should be acknowledged as such. This is true biologically and socially, since the two cannot be separated. The concept of family remains as it was in the beginning, and it is the task of Christians to give confession to that reality as well as to practice it to the best of their ability. Confusion of this order in rights advocacy of varieties of gender identification will eventually come to be seen for the foolishness that it is. In a caption of a picture in the *National Post*, a young bull jumping over runners in the Spanish town of Pamplona is referred to a "heifer bull."59 It seems someone thinks that bulls in Pamplona identify themselves as heifers, but it is quite certain that these young bulls do not suffer from gender confusion. Such confusion is a human problem; young bulls are quite secure in their self-identity. Gender confusion among humans will only continue to multiply the complexity of asserting rights. "Gender-free" washrooms entitle a man to use a women's washroom, a fact well recognized by some advocates of feminism. The requirement in this chapter that a society maintain gender distinction has never had more practical relevance.

#### *Section Overview: Holiness in Marital Affairs*

<span id="page-215-0"></span>Instructions on how order is to be practiced in select situations is followed by regulations for maintaining family integrity. Violation of family integrity must be addressed in order to preserve created order. Holiness is seen in personal relationships just as in setting apart certain things or actions to give testimony to the presence and rule of God. Israel must be holy as God is holy (Lev. 19:2). This requirement includes matters such as exercising justice, loving one's neighbor as oneself, not wearing a garment made of two kinds of cloth, and exercising responsibility in sexual relations (Deut. 22:13–22). What we distinguish as moral issues are also a part of expressing divine holiness. Association between these items follows other patterns of the Torah.

<span id="page-215-1"></span>There are many threats to marriage and therefore to the stability of the home. Conflict is characteristic of human interaction, especially when the relationship involves almost every aspect of a person's life. In addition to the usual tensions of any relationship, sexual desire is a significant component of a marriage relationship. This section deals with various types of sexual accusations or encounters that must be resolved within the community. The first deals with the malicious accusation of a discontented husband, and it involves a garment. The question of appropriate use of garments in the previous section is the segue to another question in the matter of a garment that involves a sexual question. The question of a potentially violated marriage leads to other situations of infidelity that must be addressed.

<span id="page-216-1"></span><span id="page-216-0"></span>The procedure of entering marriage is never explicitly given, but certain aspects are apparent. Marriage begins when compensation is given to the family of the bride because its family member is transferring to another family. Once the financial arrangement is made, the woman is betrothed and regarded as married even though the woman continues to live in the house of her father. If her husband suspects adultery during this time, the accusation involves the woman's parents (22:13–21). When the marriage is independent of the father's house, a confirmed violation of sexual fidelity results in death (v. 22). Cases of known infidelity involving a betrothed woman are regarded as adultery (vv. 23–27). The situation of a man's having sexual relations with a single woman is a separate question (vv. 28– 29). The whole section concludes with a single statement on exclusive rights of marriage within a family, particularly the claims a child might make against the estate of his father through sexual engagement with a wife of his father.

#### *Comment*

22:13–21 The first situation envisaged by Moses is one in which a marriage has been consummated but a husband comes to dislike his wife and then begins to spread malicious rumors about her. Rumor is one of the most insidious threats to a relationship because it is an unsubstantiated accusation against a person's reputation. In this case the charge is laid against the woman's sexual integrity. The translation "evidence of virginity" is not as clear as implied by the English meaning

of "virgin." The linguistic question involves the sense of the Hebrew word *betulah*. This is a common word in Semitic languages but is not the exact equivalent of the English *virgin*, though it is frequently translated that way in the Akkadian languages as well as in Hebrew. The English word *virgin* always carries the technical meaning of virgo intacta, a woman who has never had sexual intercourse. In Akkadian as well as Hebrew this meaning must be separately expressed by saying something like "young girls who have not known man by lying with him" (Num. 31:18).

<span id="page-217-1"></span><span id="page-217-0"></span>A woman can be called a *betulah* even though she has had intercourse, such as with the members of a harem who spend a night with the king before officially becoming part of his harem (Est. 2:17–19). The "evidence of virginity" in this case is not likely the technical question of whether the bride has previously engaged in intercourse. Several arguments mitigate against such an understanding.60 Among these is the practical consideration that a bloodstained garment is not always the result of such instances. Further, the husband would have a good idea as to whether such a garment could be produced, either legitimately or faked by the parents. He is unlikely to risk a fine and the humiliation of what is probably a public flogging if he knows his case can be disproved. This must be a case in which the husband is in doubt, but time will eventually be the final indication, quite apart from any evidence the parents could manufacture.

Linguistic evidence indicates that a young woman is a *betulah* while she is still in the care of her parents, has passed the age of puberty, and is ostensibly of good reputation. Whether the woman has had sexual intercourse before being betrothed to the husband is not nearly so important as her conduct after the time she is promised in marriage and still in the care of her parents. This would be the reason the parents are incensed that their reputation is being ruined by insidious rumor. The evidence of her being a *betulah*, the tokens of virginity, refers to the blood stains of menstruation during the time the woman is engaged, which shows that she is past the age of puberty and is not pregnant. If she has become pregnant during the time of betrothal, evidence of menstruation could not be produced and charges equivalent to adultery might stand. This would explain her punishment, which is equivalent to that for adultery. The spiteful husband is apparently spreading rumors that the woman's first child is not his own, a case that would be particularly difficult if the birth of the first child were near to the time of a full gestation from the time the marriage was consummated. If the woman is innocent, the man is punished for the ruination of the reputation of a family. If the charges can be sustained, the woman is deemed guilty of adultery.

The text does not specifically say the guilty man is to be flogged. It uses the generic term for discipline to describe his punishment (*yasar*), which, when used of the discipline of a child, could include the use of a rod (Prov. 13:24;

<span id="page-217-2"></span><sup>60</sup> The meaning of this phrase is discussed fully in Gordon J. Wenham, "Betûlāh 'A Girl of Marriageable Age,'" *VT* 22/3 (January 1972): 330–336. In the whole article Wenham discusses the meaning of *betulah* in all the cognate literature as well as its significance in all its OT occurrences.

<span id="page-218-9"></span><span id="page-218-2"></span><span id="page-218-1"></span>23:13–14; 29:15). The situation bears some analogies to that of the recalcitrant son (Deut. 21:18), in which even the most compelling means of correction were ineffective. The punishment given to the dishonest man is not equal to that which would be afflicted on his victim, as required in the case of a false witness (19:18–19). Apparently the evidence is more circumstantial and the motives for the investigation quite genuine. It might seem that the evidence against the woman is also circumstantial, but the punishment assumes that guilt has been established beyond doubt.

<span id="page-218-6"></span><span id="page-218-3"></span>The punishment for the guilty woman also involves her family, since they are participants in dissembling regarding the conduct of their daughter. The penalty is carried out in the same manner as that of the disobedient son (21:21), with the public execution meant to serve as a deterrent to others. In this instance it is because the woman has done an "outrageous thing in Israel" by "whoring in her father's house." The former expression is common with despicable sexual misconduct, such as with Absalom in the rape of his sister Tamar (2 Sam. 13:12). The latter phrase has found two different interpretations in both the various Hebrew texts and the translations. The first interpretation is that she was guilty of infidelity while still in her father's house; the second is that she has brought shame to her father's house. The first is the meaning of the Masoretic Text and confirms the interpretation that the charge is that of marital infidelity during the time she was engaged and still living with her parents. As in the case of the rebellious son, it is a case of parents' not properly controlling the behavior of their children.

<span id="page-218-4"></span>22:22 The penalty for adultery is more severe than that for any other sexual sin. This is because of the seriousness of the violation, which threatens an economic union and the well-being of the children concerned. In this case there is a violation of two families. The matter is destructive not only for the woman concerned but also for the man. In wisdom the father gives a stern warning to his son concerning adultery (Prov. 6:20–35); the price of a harlot is only money, but the violation of the wife of another man will cost the guilty one his life (Prov. 6:26, 32–35). The father has in mind not the formal penalty of execution but the revenge of an angry man who will accept no compensation for the offense.

<span id="page-218-8"></span><span id="page-218-7"></span><span id="page-218-0"></span>Adultery is not just a sin against another marriage; it is a sin against God. In other ancient Near Eastern laws the penalty for adultery may be death, but there may be leniency depending on the will of the husband since the offense is against him. Biblical law makes no such provision, as seen from Leviticus 20:10. The laws of God are not arbitrary. The will of God is the strength of the family for good reason. Violation of the family is not just an offense against the family, because *God* created family.

<span id="page-218-5"></span>22:23–24 A further example of adultery is a case in which a betrothed woman engages in sexual intercourse with another man during the time of her betrothal. This case assumes witnesses to the offense who can give testimony to the violation of adultery. The offense not only has been observed but has been deemed consensual. One part of the evidence is that the woman had the opportunity to call for protection if she had chosen to do so.

<span id="page-219-3"></span>22:25–27 The case of a woman seized by a man outside the city is regarded as rape since she would be as vulnerable and helpless as a murder victim. In such a case the man alone is to be put to death. There is no suggestion that leniency might be shown if the man did not know the status of the woman.

<span id="page-219-4"></span><span id="page-219-1"></span>22:28–29 Sexual relation with an unengaged woman is not approved, but it is nevertheless not the violation of a marriage. The action results in the man's being responsible to accept the woman as his wife in order to provide for her, without the possibility of divorce. There is no indication of involvement of the father of the dependent woman other than that the dowry price must be paid. Exodus 22:16–17 deals with a similar case, but there the situation is that the woman has been seduced. In that case marriage requires the permission of the father, but if he refuses the dowry price still must be paid. Deuteronomy focuses on the security of the woman. The price paid is not likely the normal dowry price but includes a penalty for losses incurred by the father. The will of the woman is not mentioned. Marriage is primarily regarded as a family decision involving parents, property, and children as basic considerations. An illustration of this is the Genesis narrative of Lot's determining the marriage of his daughters to Jacob. Love was not the primary concern.

<span id="page-219-5"></span>22:30 Sexual relations with a wife of one's father would not include some of the usual concomitant violations of adultery, such as breaking up a family and its property. Such relations are less likely to be a case of sexual desire than a claim of status; however, this is still a sexual offense. A father might well have older sons comparable in age to one of his younger wives. The euphemism of the Hebrew in describing the sexual violation involves a removal of the father's garment, which is to expose him as naked. This is a standard expression regarding the violation of exclusive sexual relationships (e.g., Lev. 18:7–8). Such action here is an invasion of a sexual relationship exclusive to the father, or it may be regarded as the equivalent of sexual relations with the father.

<span id="page-219-7"></span><span id="page-219-6"></span><span id="page-219-2"></span><span id="page-219-0"></span>Sexual relations with the wife of a father involves family status and usually privilege in inheritance. This could occur while the father was still alive, as in the case of Reuben at the death of Rachel (Gen. 35:22). Reuben was attempting to prevent the concubine of Rachel from assuming his mother's position at the head of the family. He was attempting to prematurely lay claim to his inheritance and become the successor to his father. The Chronicler explains that this was the reason Reuben lost his status as the head of the family (1 Chron. 5:1–3). In laying claim to David's throne, Absalom engaged in sexual relations with David's concubines "in the sight of all Israel" (2 Sam. 16:20–23). Apart from the claims of family status or inheritance that might be made in such an engagement, this was a violation of the exclusiveness of marriage.

#### *Response*

Family stability is critical to order and peaceful function in every society. This is recognized by civil authorities, who make provision for well-being of the family a high priority. Education and moral character begin at the earliest stages of human growth, which begins in the home responsible for the birth of a child. The earliest stages are also the most influential in the life of a child.

The question of marriage has become highly contested in contemporary times. The controlling value in current family function is the power of choice for the individual. Gender choice has become the highest priority in some circles and some government legislations. This has led to redefinitions of marriage and family that are not to the benefit of family stability nor the welfare of children. Mainline churches especially have adopted these modern societal mores legitimated only by the demand of individual's supposed right to choose. The high ethical demand on the preservation of marriage between a man and a woman in this chapter does not allow for this kind of redefinition of family as a simple matter of personal preference. Creation order is a primary requirement. Willful violation of this order has grave consequences for the well-being of the home and the development of children. Churches should not simply conform to cultural shifts.

The greatest challenge for the church is not in the legislative shifts in definition of marriage and family. The most grave and sad cultural conformity is in the rate of divorce and remarriage among professing believers, which tends to be the same as it is in society outside the church. It is not that divorce is to be avoided at all costs. The provisions of Moses recognize as sometimes inevitable the failure of human covenants that ends marriage. Commitments genuinely made do break down and may create destructive environments. The counsel of Paul to the formerly married, which he refers to in Greek as *agamos* ("unmarried"), was to remain single as himself, but he recognized that this was not best for everyone (1 Cor. 7:8–17). His emphasis in the passage is that it is even better for a believer to remain married to an unbeliever for the sake of the family, if possible. Divorce is not a solution; it is a recognition of a last resort in dealing with a conflicted situation.

<span id="page-220-1"></span><span id="page-220-0"></span>The attitude Jesus encountered was that divorce is an entitlement, especially on the part of the husband. The discussion on conditions for divorce had more to do with providing for self-interest of the person seeking the divorce than with ethical or family concerns. Jesus called this attitude simple adultery; it amounted to nothing more than remarriage out of lust for another woman (e.g., Matt. 19:3–12). In practice it amounted to the very violations condemned by Moses in his teaching on marriage. The disciples found this hard to understand because, apparently in their time, conformity was rampant to a culture of divorce as entitlement without acknowledging that divorce is a concession to a harsh circumstance, as taught by Moses. Christians must ponder the seriousness of the marriage vow and its violation. Adultery is a serious threat to marriage and family. The economic and other consequences may not be of the same gravity as those in an agricultural setting, but the results for children may be worse. Vows are usually taken in the church

before the congregation. This involves a pledge on the part of the congregation as a group to support every new marriage in every way it can. Western culture breeds a tendency to make a wedding a great time of celebration with insufficient attention to the endurance of the marriage once the celebrations are past. Furthermore, divorce is often presented as a positive solution, which it can never be. It is a last resort in dealing with irreconcilable conflict.

#### *Section Overview: Holiness in Community Affairs*

The ordering of the material of this section does not display any observable sequence. As in other legal writings (codes) of the ancient Near East, this Torah appears to conclude with a collection of miscellaneous items governing conduct. These are not exhaustive, as is required in modern codes designed to enable authorities to coerce behavior according to all the stipulations they wish to control. These codes are samples that authorities can use for a whole variety of analogous situations. The similarity of diverse situations is at the discretion of the judge, who determines how each case shall proceed. The legal material of this section is part of a covenant code, setting out the ways in which Israel lives in the grace of their benevolent Suzerain.

<span id="page-222-3"></span><span id="page-222-2"></span><span id="page-222-1"></span><span id="page-222-0"></span>The assembly of Israel, the topic of the first eight verses, was formed by swearing loyalty to God according to the stipulations received by Moses. In Deuteronomy, the assembly (Hb. *qahal*) designates those gathered at the mountain to hear the words of the covenant and declare allegiance to Yahweh (4:10; 5:22; 9:10; 10:4). Elsewhere in the Pentateuch the gathering of Israel is referred to also as *ʻedah* (Ex. 12:3; 16:9–10), which can refer to all Israel, the adult males, or the national representatives. These terms never refer to subdivisions of the nation, such as tribe, clan, or city, though the term *ʻedah* can bear the more specialized meaning of tribal leaders. For example, the elders of Israel are responsible for the selection of the Passover lamb (Ex. 12:21). They are the ones meant when God commands the entire *ʻedah* to select a lamb (Ex. 12:3). This specialized term for tribal leaders is not found in Deuteronomy. The *qahal* of this chapter identifies the entire

<span id="page-223-0"></span>community as participating in the worship of the Lord. Other residents could join this community and become the same as a native, provided they formally enter the covenant (Ex. 12:48–49). Membership in the assembly depends not on birth but on allegiance. It is a sacred assembly, a holy nation; for this reason certain people are necessarily excluded, as explained in Deuteronomy 23:1–8. Viewed this way, the whole chapter continues the theme of how to live as a separate or holy people in the world of the common.

<span id="page-223-3"></span><span id="page-223-1"></span>The chapter continues with regulations concerning purity, a concept closely related to holiness. According to Leviticus 10:10, the task of the sons of Aaron is to distinguish between the holy and the common, the clean and the unclean. In practical terms, "clean" may be considered the normal state of the common so that it can be dedicated to serve as sacred. The role of the priests is to teach Israel the regulations of the Torah so that it knows how to serve God. Deuteronomy 23:9–14 instructs Israel how to conduct itself as a holy camp in time of war. These instructions ensure cleanliness in matters of bodily functions involving exposure or nakedness.

<span id="page-223-4"></span>Related to the matter of war is that of slaves. Taking captives in war was a common method of enslavement. Slavery is not a normal state for a human, so Israel is instructed to protect escaped slaves. Another type of dominated individual is the temple prostitute, either male or female. Prostitution is not usually voluntary but is driven by some external circumstance. All promiscuity is also an unclean function of the gift of sex.

The text then turns to other matters related to life work. It is expected that a person enjoys the benefits of his or her work. While loans may enable a person to gain work, interest on debts readily becomes oppressive, robbing of individuals of the fruits of their labor. Petitions for divine assistance often took the form of vows of dedication to divine service. Such dedications are a life commitment; vows are binding, as they are made with an oath to God. Such vows must be fulfilled, both in being honest in the words spoken and in carrying out the commitment made to God. Often these were gifts made at the temple (Deut. 12:6).

<span id="page-223-2"></span>Finally, a farmer is entitled to the crop he has grown. Land that is farmed is no longer public property. But this does not preclude its being used as food for the needy. It is legitimate to satisfy hunger by eating from a mature crop; however, harvesting portions of it is theft. These regulations are all aspects of living together as a holy community under the sovereignty of God.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-224-2"></span>23:1–2 The first stipulation excludes an emasculated individual from participation in the covenant community. Two usual methods of sterilization are referred to here, one involving the destroying of testes and the second involving another form of castration. Intentional emasculation is forbidden to anyone wishing to belong to the assembly. The text does not specify whether the same regulation applies to those born with the condition. Voluntary emasculation, usually done for religious reasons, is forbidden in 14:1. In the cultures surrounding Israel, royal officials were sometimes made eunuchs, readily identifiable on inscriptions, but this was forbidden to Israel. In the ancient Near East, castration was also a form of punishment.

<span id="page-224-1"></span><span id="page-224-0"></span>Bodily mutilation violates the concept of cleanness, namely, that which is normal and can be sanctified. This would be reason enough for exclusion, but there may be an additional practical consideration. All members of the assembly share in a perpetual family inheritance (Num. 26:52–56). The maintenance of the boundaries of this inheritance is the responsibility of the assembly (Mic. 2:5), but this could not be maintained for those who could not father children. Inability to bear children is always a painful and problematic situation.

<span id="page-224-5"></span><span id="page-224-3"></span>Those "born of a forbidden union" (Hb. *mamzer*) are also prohibited from membership in the assembly. The tenth generation is a way of saying they may never be a part of the assembly, as is explained by the gloss in verse 3. There is no indication that the rare Hebrew word *mamzer* means "one born out of wedlock" ("bastard"). Judging by the context, these are likely marriages outside the covenant. The term might refer particularly to one permanently excluded, such as a Moabite or Ammonite. If one parent is not part of the covenant, the family does not share in allegiance to God or in the land God has given as a gift.

<span id="page-224-4"></span>23:3–6 The prohibition against Moabites and Ammonites as part of the assembly is first stated, then the explanation given. The reasons are historical—facts well known to the generation of Israel about to enter the Promised Land. The Moabites and Ammonites in these verses are those living as residents among the Israelites. Such a prohibition would not apply to an individual such as Ruth, who married into an Israelite family while in Moab and then migrated with her husband's mother, Naomi, as a family member. Ruth comes into the inheritance of the family of Naomi through her marriage to Boaz and is the means of preserving the family property for future generations. Israelite law does not forbid foreigners' becoming a part of the covenant and the assembly. Those forbidden are residents who have opposed Israel and the covenant from the time God gave them the land.

<span id="page-225-2"></span><span id="page-225-1"></span>The lands of Moab and Ammon were forbidden to Israel (Deut. 2:9, 19); there was to be no conflict with these peoples. The text is very cryptic concerning the actual events. Ammon did not assist Israel with provisions. Moab did supply Israel with food and water (2:28–29), but their encounter with Israel was not friendly. The actions of Balak, king of Moab, in hiring Balaam to curse Israel are evidence of Moab's attitude. Although the account of Balaam includes no indication of the direct involvement of Ammon in seeking to curse Israel, they were at least complicit in the affair. The attempt to curse Israel was reversed, and the curse fell upon those who attempted to turn God against Israel. The curse is experienced in Israel's perpetually not seeking the welfare (Hb. *shalom*) or prosperity of Moabites and Ammonites in their territory. The word *shalom* is the most inclusive sense of wellbeing. It involves the absence of conflict in all areas of life, which could include health, finances, or neighborly relations. God's reversal of the attempted curse of Balaam was no credit to the merits of Israel. Israel's blessing was dependent on her acceptance of the love of God in the covenant.

<span id="page-225-4"></span>23:7–8 Edomites and Egyptians hold a different status than Ammonites and Moabites. They are permitted membership in the assembly in the third generation after taking up residence in Israel. Their desire for allegiance after that period would be demonstrated as genuine. The sentiment of this stipulation is quite the opposite of the later kingdom period in the day of Obadiah and Isaiah, prophets with strong condemnation of Edom and consistent warnings against reliance on Egypt.

<span id="page-225-5"></span>23:9–14 In Deuteronomy God is generally depicted as the Holy One, whose presence is seen as a fire in the middle of the heavens. But God is immediately present among his people, a truth particularly to be remembered in the case of war. The wars of Israel are holy in the sense that they can be successful only when God is fighting on their behalf and granting them victory. Therefore, confessions of holiness must be rigorously observed by following all of the rituals of cleanliness. The concept of cleanliness can be understood only in reference to holiness, as represented by the temple, a structure never directly named in Deuteronomy but clearly assumed. Cleanliness is expressed in foods acceptable for consumption, as directed in chapter 14, but also in other activities and bodily functions. This is a system of categorization that distinguishes that which may be conceived of as contrary to life and order and therefore belonging to the realm of death and disorder. Bodily emissions and contact with a corpse are obvious examples of circumstances that require the ritual of cleansing in order for one to express the proper order of life and holiness.

<span id="page-225-6"></span><span id="page-225-3"></span><span id="page-225-0"></span>Two examples of the need for cleanliness are given, one in relation to the purity of the body and one regarding purity of space. The first concerns unspecified bodily emissions, which conceivably could be various secretions. "Nocturnal emission" is drawn from Leviticus 15:16, where the emission is specific, but the language of Deuteronomy 23:10 is more generic. Excrement must always remain outside the camp and must be covered. This might seem a practical requirement for a military encampment, but the requirement here holds deeper significance, as

<span id="page-226-8"></span><span id="page-226-3"></span><span id="page-226-0"></span>it gives testimony to consciousness of the source of life (v. 14). God must be present in Israel's midst. "Anything indecent" refers to bodily exposure or nakedness, matters in which ritual cleanliness is particularly observed. Bodily exposure to others is generally inappropriate (Gen. 9:22) and may constitute a reason a husband disapproves of his wife (Deut. 24:1). These are but samples of "every evil thing" (23:9), which could be interpreted broadly. The War Scroll at Qumran excluded all those with permanent bodily defects or skin eruptions. The Temple Scroll included every type of sexual sin or impurity.

<span id="page-226-5"></span><span id="page-226-4"></span><span id="page-226-2"></span><span id="page-226-1"></span>23:15–16 The requirement to provide asylum to a slave provides that this person will settle in Israel in a place of his own choosing (v. 16). The obvious implication is that the slave has come to seek refuge in Israel from foreign control. This is not relevant to the laws of forgiveness of debts and release of slaves in the seventh year (15:12–18). These people have voluntarily entered the service of another as a means of paying debt they owe. One of the most common circumstances of slavery was from being taken as a prisoner of war. There is no comparable regulation for an Israelite slave who might escape to a foreign country, such as the slaves of Shimei (1 Kings 2:39–40). The stipulation is part of the humanitarian character of Deuteronomy, which is contrary to the practice of all other ancient Near Eastern law. The Law of Hammurabi is characteristic: "If a seignior has harbored in his house either a fugitive male or female slave belonging to the state or to a private citizen and has not brought him forth at the summons of the police, that householder shall be put to death."61 In the ancient Near East, property had priority over life. The regulations of the Torah are the converse.

<span id="page-226-9"></span><span id="page-226-7"></span>23:17–18 Although the general prohibition of sacred prostitution is obvious, the specific interpretation of the practices referred to here must be inferred from the meaning of the Hebrew terms *qedeshah* and *qadesh* ("cult prostitute") in extrabiblical literature. There is no doubt that these are women and men dedicated to the service of a temple, but there is no specific evidence that this service involved prostitution as part of a cultic ritual to increase fecundity and fertility. Herodotus, a fifth-century-BC Greek historian, says that every Babylonian woman had to prostitute herself at least once in her life in the precincts of the Ishtar temple (*Histories* 1.199). The accuracy of this information is doubted, and in any case the significance of the requirement does not suggest a fertility cult.62 Many references to the use of proceeds from prostitution as temple revenue or for paying vows can be found in both the Bible and other literature. This appears to be one of the practices prohibited in this section.

<span id="page-226-6"></span>The following interpretation assumes that verse 17 and 18 belong together and that the second proscription should be understood as an expansion of the first. Verse 17 prohibits any woman or man from serving in the cult of a foreign

<sup>61</sup> *ANET*, 167. These well-known laws are readily consulted; a good reliable source is *ANET*.

<sup>62</sup> A discussion of the topic and related bibliography is provided by Karel van der Toorn, "Cultic Prostitution," *ADB* 5:510–513. For a discussion of the sexual activity at Baal-Peor cf. Milgrom, "Excursus 61: The Apostacy of Baal-Peor," 476–480.

<span id="page-227-7"></span><span id="page-227-4"></span>temple. Verse 18 prohibits the use of any proceeds from such service as temple revenue or for paying a vow. Various biblical texts refer to the use in the temple of the revenues of a prostitute. Micah speaks of Samaria's shrines that had been built through the proceeds of a prostitute (Mic. 1:7), the same word used in Deut. 23:18. The woman seeking to seduce the young man in Proverbs 7:14–20 must pay her vows with a bag of money when her husband has gone off on a distant journey. References to the proceeds of a prostitute may help to explain "the wages of a dog." If the word for dog (*keleb*) is being used metaphorically, its referent is a servant. The root *klb* is used widely in the ancient Near East as an equivalent to "faithful servant."63 This verse would be a prohibition against using the wages of foreign cults in exchange for temple obligations.

<span id="page-227-5"></span>The presence of such temple servants is mentioned four times in Kings (1 Kings 14:24; 15:12; 22:46; 2 Kings 23:7). They are introduced under Rehoboam, then removed by Asa and Jehoshaphat, but then have their own special rooms in the temple during the time of Manasseh, which are later removed by Josiah. Raising revenue for the temple was probably a part of all these activities, which would have included prostitution. Hosea condemns the drinking, sexual promiscuity, and adultery that were part of Israel's worship festivities, some of which involved temple personnel's (*qedeshot*) participation in sacrifice (Hos. 4:11–14). Festivities, usually involving some cult ritual, were always times of increased sexual activity, as at the scene of the golden calf (Ex. 32:6).

<span id="page-227-6"></span><span id="page-227-3"></span><span id="page-227-1"></span>Sexual seduction by the women of Moab led to the idolatry of Israel at Baalpeor just before Israel was to enter the Promised Land (Num. 25:1–15). During the time the Israelites were in the plains of Moab, many of the Israelites, including a chieftain, were lured into sacrificial feasts by the Moabite and Midianite women. In time this chieftain attempted to introduce a Midianite woman, a daughter of a chief, to his family, probably with the intent of marriage. As part of the ritual a special chamber was erected at the door of the tent of meeting in the presence of the entire assembly. The purpose of the sexual act between the son and daughter of official leaders is not specified, but it was not merely for pleasure; it belonged to the practice of the Moabite cult. This was Israel's introduction to the religions of Canaan, exposing the moral dangers they posed.

<span id="page-227-2"></span><span id="page-227-0"></span>23:19–20 Exodus 22:25 and Leviticus 25:35–37 require loans without interest to be made in order to help the poor, whether of money or goods in kind. These verses in Deuteronomy are a similar regulation, even though they do not specify that the loans are given because of poverty. Borrowing for commercial purposes was not customary, if it existed at all, so it is probable that the same situation is envisaged here. In the ancient Near East, interest rates of over 25 percent for silver and up to 50 percent for grain are known. Interest of any kind is not helpful for a person who has become poor because his revenues are simply too low. The gratitude of

<sup>63</sup> Examples in Akkadian are listed in *AHw*, "*kalbu*," 424. The term is also used for a temple servant in a Phoenician inscription from Kition listing expenses of a temple and its personnel; cf. Herbert Donner and Wolfgang Röllig, *Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften* (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1966), no. 37.

<span id="page-228-5"></span>the poor person and the approval of God are reason to loan money to someone in need (Pss. 15:5; 37:26). As part of community equilibrium, every seven years the loans themselves are forgiven and indebted individuals are set free, as required in Deuteronomy 15:1–11. Money loaned to a foreigner does not fall under this regulation because it is part of regular commercial business.

<span id="page-228-6"></span><span id="page-228-4"></span><span id="page-228-1"></span><span id="page-228-0"></span>23:21–23 Commitments are easier to make when the time to fulfill them is in the future. Vows are a way of setting apart a portion of one's life to God. That which has been so dedicated is therefore sanctified and holy, even if the fulfillment is still future. Vows are a voluntary way of exercising the discipline to do what one wants to do, which is to be a part of the work of God in his world. The passing of time may change the sentiments of the person who has freely made a vow. This may be true especially if the vow was made in time of duress, when life was in danger, as was often the case (e.g., Ps. 22:25–26). Further, financial fortunes sometimes do not materialize as expected. But the repayment of a vow could be something as emotional as the giving up of a child, as with Hannah (1 Sam. 1:11, 26–28). Vows carry with them a time commitment. In the case of Hannah, the set time was the weaning of her child. Her dedication of Samuel was more demanding than she could have known once she had shared the life of her only child for a couple of years. More often the time frame would be the crop cycle of a field or the timing of festivals such as a jubilee, the time being determined by the circumstances of the vow. Delays are already a denial of the intent of the vow. Vows are a matter of integrity in a life lived for God. Failure to carry out promises made is an offense of being untrue to one's word.

<span id="page-228-3"></span><span id="page-228-2"></span>23:24–25 Tensions arise between property owners who have invested considerable work and time in a crop and those who live within their own environment without boundaries. The oppression of Gideon's day was when herdsmen came along and helped themselves to the crop of the Israelite farmers with no sense of obligation (Judg. 6:3–6). Nomads are always looking for ways to feed their herds, and the Midianites had found a very convenient source of pasture because they knew when Israelite seeding time came. They were numerous enough that they could not be stopped. But ordinary travels would often take a person through someone else's field or vineyard. There was no prohibition against satisfying hunger as one walked along. The Gospels record just such an activity with Jesus and his disciples (Matt. 12:1–8). This law apparently applies to travelers; it does not suggest that townspeople can regularly have their fill of another person's crop. Traveling, however, is a different matter, which is why the expectations of hospitality are so important. The fruit of a field for a meal is a way for hospitality to be shown, and it is therefore an obligation.

Holiness is the continuous task of recognizing that life is a gift that comes from God, who is to be represented in the world by those created to be his image. For <span id="page-229-2"></span><span id="page-229-0"></span>this, every Israelite was required to give constant attention to being clean, that is, to take care to represent order and life. Such order was defined in the covenant and in relation to the temple as the holy place God would choose. Christians of the new covenant are the temple of God in the world, collectively as the church built as a holy temple (Eph. 2:21) and individually in the way they conduct life in their bodies (1 Cor. 6:15–20). The instructions of Moses are a pertinent reminder that every part of the life of the Christian is significant in relation to holiness. The first verses of the chapter deal with keeping the body whole and pure, especially in relation to procreation. This is directly relevant in being the temple of God but also logically extends to care for the whole body. The less common extreme is to abuse the body in too much exercise, usually in competition. The almost universal failure is to abuse the body in too little exercise and too much indulgence in drink and food. These are spiritual issues and should be regarded as profoundly significant. They are at the same time an individual evaluation for which there can be no specific regulation, unlike with some of the items in this chapter.

Association is as important in holiness as individual care of the body is. The regulation regarding "forbidden unions" is directly relevant. It is applicable in demanding that those who are part of the church, the equivalent of the Israelite assembly, make confession of the covenant. This further requires that the life of church members not be a flagrant disregard of conduct expected of a Christian. It does not mean that there may never be such a thing as a mixed marriage, as a spouse cannot make decisions for a partner (e.g., 1 Cor. 7:12–17). But there are those who disqualify themselves from belonging to the church covenant because of other associations, equivalent to the Moabite or an Ammonite. Christian relationship with others is also a part of holiness.

<span id="page-229-1"></span>The matters of how slaves seeking refuge are to be treated and the charging of interest must be followed in the intent of providing for the needs of others. This has become a very difficult question in contemporary time, especially in countries in which the number of refugees is enormous. People movements have never been greater, often for very good reasons. This is the responsibility of the state in relation to residency and provision, but it is a matter for the Christian church to assist in ways that it reasonably can.

An important area of holiness that must not be minimized is in dealing with vows. In these instructions Moses deals specifically with vows relating to money. Such vows are an important spiritual discipline; they are a way of enabling Christians to do what is right and what they desire to do. The challenge is in keeping the vow made, but this can never be regarded as a matter of choice. The choice is in making the vow, not in keeping it. Keeping vows is one of the most effective ways of showing the integrity of character that should be true for every Christian.

24"When a man takes a wife and marries her, if then she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, and she departs out of his house, **<sup>2</sup>** and if she goes and becomes another man's wife, **<sup>3</sup>** and the latter man hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter man dies, who took her to be his wife, **<sup>4</sup>** then her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination before the Lord.

<span id="page-231-1"></span><span id="page-231-0"></span>Although exhortation is characteristic of Deuteronomy, in this chapter it becomes a refrain that joins otherwise disparate laws. Israel must be careful to observe all the provisions of the covenant (24:8–9, 18, 22). The first law on divorce ends with the reminder that they must not commit sin against the land the Lord has given them (v. 4). The motivation for this exhortation is a common theme in Deuteronomy: they have been redeemed from Egypt, where they were slaves. The common requirement is care for the weak and vulnerable, remembering that this was their lot in Egypt. The regulations of this chapter range around a variety of usual situations, but all of them have in common a concern for the material protection of the defenseless.

The first regulation is material protection and security for a divorced wife. It requires a husband who divorces his wife to provide her with a divorce certificate. It guarantees the right of the woman to remarry and protects her property from any further claim by the divorcing husband. This remarkable provision for women does not derive from any other culture, though in other ways Israel shares similar practices of marriage and divorce as those of its neighbors.64 A related law is that of the newlywed husband, who is exempted from any obligation to military duty. This is particularly critical to the woman, because she does not yet have a secure or financially established home. The absence of her husband puts great stress on her—it makes her responsible for the care of the fields. Should her husband be injured or die in battle, she is left without children or many resources.

<span id="page-231-2"></span>The laws pertaining to collateral for loans and the protection of the life of the vulnerable share the same humanitarian concern. They are related in that property or financial interest must not take priority over the value of a human life. The chapter concludes with a stipulation that some of the harvest be left as food for the needy (vv. 19–21). The mandate for the poor is introduced and concluded with the exhortation to remember that the Israelites were slaves in the land of Egypt. Care for the poor is their spiritual responsibility as a redeemed people.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-232-2"></span><span id="page-232-1"></span><span id="page-232-0"></span>24:1–4 Although divorce is rarely encountered in the OT, it probably was as common in Israel as it was among other nations. Few regulations are given concerning the procedures of divorce, with this passage being the most specific. The only OT mentions of grounds for divorce are the failure of a husband to provide food, clothing, or conjugal relations (Ex. 21:10–11) and the "some indecency" mentioned in Deuteronomy 24:1. Differences between Scripture and the laws of other ancient nations include the rights of a woman to remain married and to remarry. The one absolute distinction of Israel was the woman's right to a divorce certificate, which affirmed she was free to remarry. The question of interpretation in the stipulation stated here concerns the conditions of the divorce that lead to the documentation given to the wife and that prevent the husband from ever marrying her again and therefore having access to her property.

The divorce law is formulated as a conditional sentence, a common form in legal material of ancient Near Eastern cultures. These have been called casuistic or case law because they first state a condition or circumstance in which the law applies. When the offense has been stated, along with associated matters (the protasis, or "if" clause), the response clause enunciates the legal pronouncement (the apodosis, or "then" clause). The lengthy protasis of this case constitutes seven distinct criteria that must be present: marriage of the woman, charge of indecency of the wife, divorce by the man, woman's remarriage, second husband's rejection, second husband's divorce (or death), and first husband's attempt to marry her again. In such a circumstance the remarriage is forbidden. The more usual cases of divorce involve simply a husband's hating his wife and divorcing her. In such a case the husband is required to repay the dowry to his wife and possibly provide other compensation, as stated everywhere in ancient Near Eastern law. But if a husband has a case for divorce, repayment of the dowry is not required. It is also possible that the husband could seek to marry the woman again, potentially for the financial benefit. In the case given by Moses in this example, the first husband is apparently seeking to divorce his wife with a minimum of financial penalty, using this charge against her to reduce his responsibilities.

In the course of time, it could be discovered that the claims made by the first husband were not valid, or they might be discounted, given the new circumstances of his former wife. She now would have considerably more wealth because of the intervening marriage, and he would want to marry her again if the opportunity arose. This is forbidden, because the husband would benefit twice. If he was able to divorce while paying the minimum penalty, a remarriage would further benefit him because she would come with her dowry and inheritance from her second husband. Denying the grounds of the original divorce for financial benefit is an abomination.

<span id="page-233-3"></span><span id="page-233-2"></span><span id="page-233-1"></span>Two lexical questions must be addressed in clarifying the prohibition of the remarriage of the divorced woman to her first husband. The first is the charge of "some indecency (v. 1)," and the second is the consequence of her being "defiled" (v. 4). The first is the rare Hebrew word *'erwat*, the same word used in relation to bodily exposures involving any kind of secretion that might defile the army camp (23:14). The second is *huttamma'ah*, found only here in the passive form. It carries the sense that she has been required to declare herself unclean, probably with reference to the charge of her first husband. The sense of *'erwat* must have something to do with sexuality; if the previous usage is a guide, it would also have to do with bodily secretions. It is probable that it has to do with menstruation, possibly a situation in which the woman has a continuous flow of blood, as in the case of the woman seeking help from Jesus (Mark 5:25–34).65 A problem of this nature would make her continuously unclean and therefore forbid her from intercourse. It might also prevent her from ever having children. The husband might have learned of this only after he married her and, instead of having compassion, divorce her in his own interests.

<span id="page-233-5"></span>Other similar interpretations have been proposed for this passage and fall within the semantic meaning of the stipulations of this law. As with other casuistic laws, this case is meant to be exemplary and may be intentionally ambiguous so as to include a variety of similar circumstances. By requiring a certificate of divorce and forbidding remarriage to the person who gave it, the law guarantees a woman's protection on two counts. She is assured of the right to remarry without fear of further interference from her first husband or any claims from him. She achieves financial independence and is perpetually free to remarry anyone else. Remarriage to her first husband would be a denial of the original reason for the divorce and a compromise of the freedoms she had received. Denial of the protection given in the divorce certificate is abhorrent to the Lord and brings wrong on the land the Lord is giving them.

The argument that the remarriage constitutes the woman as unclean is a fundamental contradiction to the purpose of the certificate. If the remarriage made her unclean, it would amount to adultery and would be forbidden outright. The protasis asserts the opposite: the certificate of divorce guarantees her right to remarry without penalty.

<span id="page-233-4"></span><span id="page-233-0"></span>24:5 Armies were summoned from the citizenry in time of need. These are wars for the citizenry: the people go out to war (Deut. 20:1). Small standing armies

<sup>65</sup> The linguistic case for this meaning has been made by John Walton, "The Place of the *hutqaṭṭēl* within the D-Stem Group and Its Implications in Deuteronomy 24:4," *HS* 32 (1991): 14–15.

supported Saul and David, while organized military warfare grew under Solomon. In general, however, men were summoned to battle as the need arose. Those newly establishing a home were exempt for the sake of their home and to meet the expectations of their new bride. This is another law with the well-being of women in mind, since the causative form of the verb does not merely mean "to be happy with his wife." Rather, the husband is to bring joy to his wife. The woman's expectations in marriage include much more than sexual satisfaction. Though the text is not explicit, the usual circumstance would be a first marriage for both the man and the woman.

<span id="page-234-4"></span><span id="page-234-3"></span>24:6–7 Loans could not be given at interest (23:19), but the creditor could have a type of lien on the debtor's property to ensure repayment. It is not specified that this is determined in advance. It might become a decision of the creditor when a loan is defaulted. But a creditor is limited in his claims for collateral until the loan is paid. He cannot claim an essential item such as a mill or a portion of it, which is present in every household for the purpose of making daily bread.

<span id="page-234-6"></span><span id="page-234-0"></span>The regulation on kidnapping is found with the same stipulations in Exodus 21:16, though Deuteronomy specifies the victim as an Israelite. It is likely that the same penalty would apply for a non-Israelite, as stated in Exodus. It may be that Moses is emphasizing the more egregious case of an Israelite who might take a human life as pledge for a loan. One of the crimes of the rich was to take the children of the poor in pledge for a loan (Job 24:9). This was not the same as a man's volunteering his services to work off a debt. Kidnapping, though no doubt rationalized legally, falls in the category of property and human life, which is an appropriate sequel to the laws on marriage and loans. However, the action of stealing a person for slavery reduces human life to property, the most egregious manner of violating life in the interests of material gain. It is particularly opprobrious and therefore subject to the same penalty as actually killing another person.

<span id="page-234-5"></span><span id="page-234-1"></span>24:8–9 The laws concerning leprosy are assumed to be well known. The command to observe them carefully is linked with the requirement to follow the teaching of the Levites in observance of the covenant that the Lord gave Israel when bringing them out of Egypt. The example of Miriam in Numbers 12:9–13 serves as a warning of the importance of observing all the commandments. Aaron compares the situation of Miriam to the curse of death (Num. 12:12), which may be why this law is singled out as an example of the necessity of observing the entire covenant. In this sense it is analogous to the kidnapped slave or the poor person left without a means to provide for his own food.

<span id="page-234-2"></span>A "leprous disease" is a good way of indicating that the Hebrew term refers to a wide variety of conditions that do not fall under the modern category of Hansen's disease. It affected many aspects of daily life in Israel and so was an appropriate example to use for the exhortation to faithfulness, which both concludes the previous section and introduces the following commands, which deal with the importance of not taking advantage of the poor.

<span id="page-235-2"></span>24:10–13 Money is always a contentious subject. Unpaid debts have always been a major problem for anyone engaging in commerce, even if it is simple peasant-level farming. Various kinds of pressure are used to collect on defaulted loans, including the confiscation of property. The stipulations of these verses set two limits on actions that can be taken to collect a loan. The first is that confiscation of property against a loan must be voluntary on the part of the debtor. The second is that the item confiscated must not endanger health or well-being. If a garment is used as a blanket at night, it must be returned each evening.

<span id="page-235-1"></span><span id="page-235-0"></span>Two different terms are used for the giving of an item in pledge as security for a loan. In Deuteronomy 24:6, 17 the Hebrew term is *habal*; in verses 10, 12 the term is *'abat.* The first term has the sense of seizing something as a pledge; the second refers to obtaining a deposit as collateral or making a loan against a deposit. The difference in the first case is that the pledge is taken after failure to pay the loan, while in the second the loan is made using a pledge as security. These are to be distinguished from *'arab*, which means to act as a guarantor of a loan for someone else. This is warned against in Proverbs repeatedly (e.g., Prov. 6:1; 11:15), as it carries the risk of total loss. One may be obligated to cover for a bad debt with no hope of any kind of recompense. The difference is comparable to the distinction between cosigning for the purchase of a property and acting as guarantor for a loan. In the case of cosigning, both parties hold title until the debt is fully paid. This provides a measure of collateral in case of default of payments.

<span id="page-235-5"></span><span id="page-235-3"></span>24:14–15 Laborers are dependent each day for payment, as they are landless and have no other resources. Delay of pay is a threat to their well-being and to their families. This is unacceptable conduct irrespective of whether the worker is a fellow Israelite. The admonition concludes with the warning that such conduct will bring judgment. The case of kindness in relation to pledges gives promise of blessing for the consideration given. All laborers deserve consideration and respect. They have a powerful recourse in being able to call out to a God of compassion.

<span id="page-235-4"></span>24:16 This law is an example of general requirements of justice in protecting human life. In biblical covenant code, human life always takes precedence. Justice is repayment of loss incurred and is never revenge. Such considerations were not the case with other codes. In contrast to the stipulation of this verse, the Code of Hammurabi addresses cases in which a builder is responsible for the collapse of a house, causing death or injury. In one such clause we read, "If it has caused the death of a son of the owner of the house, they shall put the son of that builder to death."66 The translation "Each one shall be put to death for his own sin" is not to be read as a theological statement referring to offenses against God. In the context of law, the word translated "sin" (Hb. *heteh*) refers to a legal offense or crime. It refers to missing the mark as stated in legal requirement.

<span id="page-236-11"></span><span id="page-236-3"></span>24:17–18 The admonitions to be careful not to exploit the weak and defenseless conclude with a general statement found frequently in the prophets. Isaiah singles out exactly this topic in his condemnation of the leaders of Israel for breaking the covenant (e.g., Isa. 1:16–17). Confiscating (Hb. *habal*, "take") an essential garment to collect on a debt recalls and concludes the previous examples. The whole section ends with a reminder of the mercy Israel has received.

<span id="page-236-4"></span><span id="page-236-1"></span>24:19–22 The whole chapter concludes with a final provision for the welfare of widows, aliens, and orphans. Farmers are not to be stingy in gathering up every last sheaf, olive, or grape in their harvest. The landless should also share in the harvest. The practice is illustrated in the book of Ruth, in which a widowed Moabite harvests in the fields of Boaz, a man who specifically orders consideration be given to her. This complements the tithe of every third year (Deut. 14:28–29), by which a tenth of the crop is given to the Levite and the poor of the land. The practice is mandatory, but in doing this the Israelites acknowledge that the land is a gift of God graciously given to them.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-236-5"></span><span id="page-236-2"></span>Chapter 24 provides specific examples that answer the question of the liturgies celebrated in Psalms 15 and 24. Psalm 24 begins with a confession concerning the Creator:

 The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers. (24:1–2)

<span id="page-236-10"></span><span id="page-236-9"></span><span id="page-236-8"></span><span id="page-236-6"></span><span id="page-236-0"></span>Following this confession, which is a poetic declaration of the account of Genesis 1:1–2, those coming to worship are faced with the question "Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place?" (Ps. 24:3) The answer is those who keep their oath of the covenant, who have not taken the name of the Lord in vain, who have not sworn deceitfully (Ps. 24:4). This question is also the introduction of Psalm 15, and Psalm 15:2 provides essentially the same answer: those who live with integrity and do what is right. Moses is leading Israel in a renewal of the covenant when they enter the Promised Land. As he comes to conclude this Torah, Moses brings together the very practical, ordinary considerations of qualifying for worship at the place the Lord will choose.

<span id="page-236-7"></span>In Israel, worship at the temple was never separate from questions of faith and life. Psalm 15 provides a detailed answer to the question of integrity in the life of the covenant. It begins with speech. The words of worshipers are trustworthy: they do not speak ill of their neighbor; they never bring disgrace upon those around them. There is an acknowledged division within the people of Israel. On one side are those that are rejected (Ps. 15:4a) because they do not keep covenant. These are held in low regard, but those who fear the Lord are honored. Another issue of the psalm is money. The righteous do not loan money for gain nor accept a bribe against the innocent. Words and money are the two aspects of common life that are part of the activity of every day. Integrity with words and money is the qualification for worship because it is a manifestation of faithfulness.

Every visitor to Zion is asked to give a declaration of loyalty. Is the life of the covenant as taught by Moses in this chapter characteristic of your conduct? These simple sample activities are the measure of a righteous person. The gift of salvation in OT faith is not a magic center of power dispensed in impersonal fullness at temple festivals. Salvation is for those who come to the temple living the way of the covenant. They stand on the Rock that cannot be shaken. That Rock is the God of the temple built upon Mount Zion.

<span id="page-237-5"></span><span id="page-237-4"></span><span id="page-237-3"></span>These truths have an eschatological aspect for the Christian. Christ has become our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ is the fullness of everything the covenant demands of the righteous person. Membership in the new covenant is to belong to Christ. Those in Christ have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, the festive assembly of myriads of angels, to the Judge who is God of all, to the spirits of the righteous who are perfected, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant whose blood speaks of better things than that of Abel (Heb. 12:22–24). The "spirits of the righteous made perfect" (Heb. 12:23) can be none other than those of faith who followed in the teaching of Moses. The blood of Abel cried out from the ground for justice, but the blood of Christ brings cleansing and redemption. Those of the church of the firstborn, which must refer to all those in the new covenant, are called to manifest their faith in their works (James 2:14–17). What does it profit if the person of faith says be warmed and filled to the person who is naked and has no food? The practice of faith for those coming to Mount Zion is also that of those who have come to the heavenly Jerusalem.

<span id="page-237-6"></span><span id="page-237-2"></span><span id="page-237-1"></span><span id="page-237-0"></span>Chapter 24 begins with the problem of marriage breakdown, referred to frequently because it is quoted by Jesus in response to a question concerning a right to divorce (Matt. 19:1–10). Jesus responds by saying divorce is not a right and that the only reference to divorce proceedings should not turn on questions of grounds establishing such a right. Moses avoids giving any grounds for divorce via the ambiguity of the first statement of the premise. The provision of Moses is about protecting a family in the covenant of Israel when marriage breaks down. Jesus does not extend the interpretation of this passage with grounds for remarriage. There are no grounds for remarriage, which is not to say it should never happen (cf. the Response section on 22:13–30 for a discussion on marriage). Divorce is a failure requiring forgiveness and restoration as far as it is possible. Such penitent persons do qualify for worship in the holy temple of the church.

### <span id="page-238-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 25:1–19

25"If there is a dispute between men and they come into court and the judges decide between them, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty, **<sup>2</sup>** then if the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall cause him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with a number of stripes in proportion to his offense. **3**Forty stripes may be given him, but not more, lest, if one should go on to beat him with more stripes than these, your brother be degraded in your sight.

#### *Section Overview: Order in the Community*

<span id="page-239-0"></span>As Moses brings his exposition of the Torah to a conclusion, he returns to regulations that pertain to the whole community. This is fitting, since the fourth topic of the exposition deals with domestic and civil regulations. The covenant community was defined by regulatory confessions that distinguished it as holy, belonging to God. These included items as disparate as the requirement to wear tassels (Deut. 22:12) and to exclude Moabites and Ammonites from the assembly (23:3–6). The concluding reference to Amalek at the very end of the fourth topic of civil regulations returns to the theme of the distinction of the Israelite community as belonging to God (25:17–19). Defining Israel as a holy community is not an assumption of moral superiority or any innate virtue. It declares the commitment of Israel to live according to the covenant under the sovereignty of the Suzerain who had redeemed them.

<span id="page-239-5"></span><span id="page-239-4"></span><span id="page-239-3"></span><span id="page-239-2"></span><span id="page-239-1"></span>Within such a community there would still be need of officials to settle the damages of private quarrels (25:1–3). In a physical conflict there might be serious injury from third-party intervention, requiring civil investigation and punishment (vv. 11–12). Death would raise problems in providing for the succession of the ownership of family property, requiring effective legislation for such a circumstance (vv. 5–10). There was always danger of economic violation in ordinary commerce through use of variable weights or measures (vv. 13–16). These disparate community regulations for order are arranged by certain catchwords not represented in translation, as will be noted in the exposition. This seems to be a common technique of scribes in the transmission of ancient texts, a vestige of techniques used in memorization and oral instruction. Until the invention of the printing press, most of community life functioned on oral transmission and mnemonic retention of detail. What appears to be arbitrary in a literary document might be quite logical in a life situation—what literary form critics labelled *Sitz im Leben*, a German phrase meaning "setting in life."

#### *Comment*

25:1–3 The section begins with a regulation concerning judicial procedure in determining sentences, one that sets limits on the punishment that can be administered. It is similar in form to the law forbidding the transference of penalty within <span id="page-240-3"></span>families in 24:16. Individuals involved in a fight might go to court so that what began as a private dispute then becomes a public case. A plurality of judges hears the case and determines punishment. If the offense is so egregious as to require physical punishment, the judges determine the actual number of strokes to be administered. The procedure is supervised by one of the judges, who counts the strokes as they are given. The maximum number is forty. The reason for this limit is that offenders are still citizens, part of the family; whatever their misdemeanor, they are not to be humiliated. Correction and deterrence are not effective if they are humiliating.

<span id="page-240-2"></span><span id="page-240-1"></span>Flogging is likely the punishment for the man who maligns his bride (22:18), the only actual case given in Scripture. In that case a fine is administered in addition to the flogging. The application in a civil context is an extension of punishment carried out in a domestic context, as expressed in the case of parents' bringing a son to civil attention (21:18–21). Its purpose is to be instructive and preventative, as is indicated by the nuance of the verb in 21:18. The Hebrew verb *yasar* always carries the sense of instruction. Punishment is never to be an exacting of revenge.

<span id="page-240-7"></span><span id="page-240-5"></span><span id="page-240-0"></span>25:4 If mnemonic devices are in part responsible for the way Deuteronomy has been transcribed, the position of the law concerning oxen is determined by the reference to beating. "Treading out the grain" renders the Hebrew root *dwsh*, which describes a method of beating the kernels from the head of the stalk. This might be done with a stick; Gideon was "beating" (*hobet*) the stalks of grain in a wine vat so as not to be seen by the Midianites (Judg. 6:11). Harvesting of olives was done by beating the branches to knock the fruit to the ground (Deut. 24:20). A labor-saving means of threshing (*dwsh*) wheat was to spread the grain on a rock and, with an ox, pull a weighted board fixed with iron or stones over the stalks (cf. the threshing sledge of Amos 1:3).

<span id="page-240-9"></span><span id="page-240-4"></span>Animals doing draught work normally eat as they pull. The farmer might object because it distracts the animal from working, and in this case the ox would be consuming valuable crop. The ox will not be much interested in dried straw; it will be aiming to lick up the kernels. This is another of the Deuteronomic laws that demands the respect of animals as living creatures in the world of the common. As expressed in Proverbs 12:10, a righteous man understands the desires of an animal.

<span id="page-240-8"></span><span id="page-240-6"></span>25:5–10 Levirate marriage accommodates the integrity of family and the order of community in the case of the death of a son who does not yet have children to become heirs. It provides for the marriage of his widow within the family. In that way, it is related to the general topic of the chapter. In terms of mnemonic devices, there may be an association here with references to parts of the body: punishment takes place before the face of a judge, the mouth of the oxen must not be muzzled, the widow refused marriage shames the man by drawing the sandal from his foot, and the injury in the intervention of the following section involves grasping the genitals.

The requirement has been given the name "levirate marriage" from the Latin *levir* ("husband's brother"). When a woman marries, she leaves her parental home and her right to the family property. The compensation for her inheritance is the dowry she takes with her. The assumption is that she is now entitled to live on the property of her husband's family. The law begins with the condition that two brothers live together. This is a statement to the effect that the brothers are interdependent. The implication is that they have married but have not yet attained independence in their share of the family inheritance. They are still living under the protection and provision of their parents. If one of the husbands dies, his wife is the responsibility of the family. She must not be left without property or the legacy of her husband. This law requires a man to manage the property of his brother and to provide eventual heirs for that property.

<span id="page-241-0"></span>This requirement was not advantageous to the surviving brother. It involved significant investment in a property that would eventually become part of another family independent of his own. The significance of this cost caused Onan, son of Judah, to prevent the pregnancy of his brother's wife, Tamar (Gen. 38:8–10). The consequence of avoiding this obligation were grave: Onan died as a judgment from God. Judah kept Tamar as part of his household but out of fear did not fulfill the further obligation of giving her in marriage to his second son. Another example of this law is in the story of the widow Ruth. Ruth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi, who held property at Bethlehem. The nearest of kin declined to take on the obligation of caring for an additional family (Ruth 4:6)—it would endanger his own properties. Boaz then purchased the property as a redeemer, which is not the same as marrying the brother of the deceased. Each of these stories is a variation on the law given in Deuteronomy, probably indicative of variation of practice over time. Laws like this were common in the ancient Near East, though they may have functioned in variant ways.

<span id="page-241-6"></span><span id="page-241-5"></span><span id="page-241-1"></span>The reason for the law is to prevent a man's name from being blotted out (Deut. 25:6), that is, to prevent a person from losing his inheritance. The import of continuing the name is expressed by Jacob in adopting Ephraim and Manasseh in Genesis 48:4–6. Jacob adopts the sons of Joseph as his own, and they receive their inheritance in Canaan. Jacob justifies this authority based on the recognition that the divine promise of the land of Canaan is an inheritance to his sons. Later sons of Joseph would receive an inheritance in the name of their older brothers. In the same way the sons of a levirate marriage would take the name of their deceased "father." Preserving the name for the sake of inheritance was important. If a man only had daughters, they would receive the inheritance and become the means of perpetuating his name (Num. 27:1–11). The children may have retained the name of their mother's father.

<span id="page-241-4"></span><span id="page-241-3"></span><span id="page-241-2"></span>This is an exceptional circumstance of marriage that stands in contradiction to the general prohibition of sexual relations with a brother's wife (Lev. 18:16; 20:21). The importance of this responsibility is indicated by the consequences of refusing to accept it. It involves a public ceremony of removing a sandal from the <span id="page-242-1"></span>foot of the brother and spitting in his face. The reputation of the family remains tarnished forever via a pejorative epithet. In the book of Ruth, the relative who transfers to Boaz the right of purchasing the property of Elimelek takes off his sandal and hands it over to Boaz. In Deuteronomy 25:9 the widow removes the sandal without handing it over, which may mean that she has now seceded from the family, which has no further claim on her. This would mean the deceased brother would simply disappear from the family. Whether she spit directly in the face of the brother or on the ground in front of him, this would be a defiant and hostile gesture, expressing the humiliation felt by the widow and the emotion of her being excluded from her husband's family.

<span id="page-242-2"></span>25:11–12 The law prescribing a penalty of mutilation for injury caused to genitals may be related to the previous regulation regarding marriage, in light of the gravity in both cases of endangering the prospect of posterity. This law is remarkable in singling out a woman for inflicting this specific injury. The motives for the woman's intervention are laudable, which makes the penalty particularly harsh. But the seriousness of the woman's action must not be minimized. Genital injury is not only extremely painful but can be fatal.67 It is surprising that the punishment is mutilation, since this is nowhere else a penalty in biblical law. It caused great discussion among the rabbis; it may be that some of their inferences are correct. The usual punishment for bodily injury is a fine; the amount of which is stated in terms of the nature of the injury inflicted, as expressed in Exodus 21:22–25. The rabbis inferred that a fine is also meant in this instance (*Sifre Deuteronomy*  §292). Since this injury cannot be inflicted on a woman, the fine is expressed in terms of the hand that caused the injury. The Hebrew term for hand (*yad*) is used also to refer to male genitals, so it is sometimes suggested that this is the female equivalent in expressing the penalty to be imposed.

<span id="page-242-3"></span><span id="page-242-0"></span>25:13–16 Integrity in weights and measures pertains to every individual, not only merchants. This is the last legal requirement in the exposition of the law, and it is applicable to all Israelites. Its climactic position indicates that honesty in all transactions is critical in the maintenance of social order. Before the time of currency, money was measured by weight via a balance scale. A stone was the common means of determining the amount of silver paid (the most common metal of currency). A temptation would be the use of a lighter stone when buying and a heavier one when selling. The same would hold for measures of volume; the measure given is an ephah, a common amount that would be traded for grain equal to a tenth of a homer, a term derived from the weight a donkey could carry (c. 200 pounds [90 kg], four bushels of barley in modern weight). In volume an ephah was about three-fifths of a bushel. The standard measure of an ephah varied over time, so the temptation would be to use the standard advantageous in a transaction. The prophet Amos condemns the merchants of Israel who sell with a small ephah

<sup>67</sup> This commentator's great-grandfather died because of just such an injury inflicted by his father-in-law. The consequences were severe, resulting in a complication of marriages and eventual emigration from Poland.

<span id="page-243-6"></span>and a heavy shekel (Amos 8:5). When standard measures were not very precise, it was easier to be fraudulent. Amos specifies this practice (Amos 8:5) as one of the injustices that brings an end to the kingdom of Israel after Jeroboam II.

<span id="page-243-2"></span><span id="page-243-1"></span><span id="page-243-0"></span>25:17–19 The attack of the Amalekites is described in Exodus 17:8–16. Amalek is the thirteenth descendant of Esau in Genesis 36. He was born to Timna, a Horite, a people indigenous to Mount Seir. The Edomites largely displaced them, making them nomads in the Sinai Peninsula. The sudden appearance of the Israelites in the Sinai was a threat to Amalekite control of oases and trade routes. They attacked Israel at a most vulnerable time. According to Psalm 83:4–9 they were among other nations who plotted to destroy Israel. They rank with the Canaanites as perpetual enemies of Israel.

<span id="page-243-4"></span>The command to remember is characteristic of Deuteronomy and an appropriate close to this section on the life of the community of Israel. The name of Amalek is to be blotted out so that the Amalekites lose all rights to their territory. This command concludes a key topic of the chapter, the entitlement of property expressed by not blotting out someone's name. The first attempt to eliminate the Amalekites was assigned to Saul (1 Samuel 15), but their removal from the territory was accomplished by David.

Conflict within families and societies is a problem that sometimes requires coercive intervention, as recognized by the stipulations of this chapter. The provisions of Moses are practical and effective in providing security and stability. They are a means by which communities could control crime within their midst in a way that is the least disruptive and as positively corrective as possible. Executions are limited to extreme cases. The goal is to enable citizens to live free and independent lives as much as possible, which requires being responsible for those who come into difficult situations.

<span id="page-243-5"></span>The modern convention of prison as a means of controlling offenders was impossible in ancient times. Confinement was limited and temporary. People were restrained as captives in war or as political enemies. Samson was a prisoner-of-war bound by the Philistines and made a slave. Sometimes prisoners were kept in custody rather than killed, as in the case of Jeremiah (Jer. 37:15–16). Other confined persons might be debtors working off obligations. For ancient societies, confinement as punishment was inconceivable for controlling violence and corruption. Not only were prisons too expensive to maintain but families relied on detained persons to provide for them. This is not true in most parts of the world today, where families must provide not only for themselves but for the person confined.

Control of violence in modern Western societies is less stark than the public executions and torture practiced in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Public resistance to these extremes led to the growth of a modern prison system that could be defended as a deterrent and a correction. Prisons were established

as an opportunity for instruction and moral reform, but their development has been in the opposite direction. People of like mind are grouped together and learn from each other how to carry out their nefarious work more effectively. In time many prisoners find prison to be the best home for them—a place where they are secure and can function.

Modern prison systems are part of a legal system that claims to deliver justice. Legislation is enacted by governments as codes. These codes are enforced by courts that administer punishment, which has two essential forms: a monetary fine or prison. Justice is conceived as the right of the state to inflict penalty for violation of the state legal code. A problem with this conception of justice is that the victim of an offense is left out of the equation. A further problem is that punishment for the most part generates anger, as punishment alone does not correct. Often the connection between offense and punishment is remote and arbitrary, such as in confining nonviolent people for economic crimes. The penal system called justice is in many cases not only unjust but also ineffective and expensive.

<span id="page-244-1"></span><span id="page-244-0"></span>The biblical system of justice operates on a different principle. Justice is always a matter of paying for damages done to the victim. It is a matter of caring for the poor and the needy (e.g., Isa. 1:16–17). The responsibility of the community was to protect the victim and provide for its dependent members. This did not preclude the possibility of corrective measures, as may be seen in the first regulation of Deuteronomy 25. Administration of physical beating was intended for correction, with a stipulation that limited the punishment so that it did not turn into humiliation. Cases of imprisonment had nothing to do with justice or correction of moral conduct. In the biblical system punishment and correction are distinct concepts. Punishment is administered for threats against the state, as in the outbreak of war or political revolution.

<span id="page-244-2"></span>Some matters of justice remain unchanged, such as honesty in using weights and measures. The means of theft and fraud change with technology, but the need to control such schemes is the same. One of the biggest problems in Scripture is state complicity in economic corruption, as in the days of Ahaz (e.g., Mic. 6:9–12). The whole court system was controlled by corruption supported by the political power of Judah. A few became wealthy at the expense of the poor and dependent. The world has not changed in this respect. Christians must seek to live in their own situation with as much as justice and integrity as is possible. This begins with understanding clearly the distinct concepts of justice and punishment, a difference nonexistent in modern penal systems.

#### *Section Overview: Offerings of Firstfruits and Tithes*

<span id="page-246-7"></span><span id="page-246-5"></span><span id="page-246-4"></span>This chapter brings the exposition of this Torah back to its opening theme of making confession at the place the Lord will choose (Deut. 12:1–31). The Torah required every representative to appear at the place of divine choosing three times a year (16:16–17). Two additional ceremonies are prescribed as Moses concludes the regulations of the covenant. The first is the presentation of a symbolic gift of the first of the harvest, given to the priest at the place God will choose (26:1–11). The second is the completion of the tithe of the third year in each city (26:12–15). The time of each is determined by the harvest. The first takes place as soon as the harvest has begun; the second when all the harvest is complete, enabling the amount of the tithe to be calculated. These ceremonies emphasize not the ritual detail but rather the confession that accompanies them. The first is testimony to divine redemption. The second is an assertion that the responsibility to care for the poor and vulnerable has been fully and properly carried out.

<span id="page-246-8"></span><span id="page-246-3"></span>All of the ceremonies prescribed by Moses are a part of worship that is intimately connected to the agricultural cycle. This is not an accident. The dictum of Deuteronomy is that mortals do not live by bread alone (8:3). The gift of food is no less a daily miracle than the gift of life. All mortals must know that the life-giving Word of God is the means of life. It is fatal self-deception to believe that in some way those who are made by God as his image can live independently from him. Israel was an agrarian society that lived directly off the land, providing a regular reminder that the source of life is the one who has given them the covenant.

<span id="page-246-6"></span><span id="page-246-1"></span><span id="page-246-0"></span>The chapter concludes with the mandate of the great Shema as given in 6:4–5. Israel's devotion to serving God must be with all their heart and all their soul (26:16). The closing verses of chapter 26 form an inclusio with the entire second speech of Moses, which began with the exhortation to learn to fear the Lord God (6:2). Moses reminds Israel again that God has led them to make the great confession that they are a treasured people distinct from all nations because of God's love for them (26:18–19). Their distinction as a holy people (v. 19) recalls what Moses said at 7:6 and 14:2. Israel was not just another nation among the common. Their function was to represent God in the world, and they had a sacred duty to declare the majestic name of God continually, as expressed in Psalm 8.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-247-7"></span><span id="page-247-6"></span>26:1–4 The ceremony of the firstfruits is to take place when Israel has settled in the land, when families have received their allotted land and are able to harvest crops. Although the description requires the ceremony upon first entering the land, the intent of the instruction is for it to be observed every year. The formulation of the instruction makes clear that it must obeyed at the very first harvest. The firstfruits must be brought from each crop (v. 2). Since crops mature at different times, those at a distance from the temple would probably make a single journey with all the different firstfruits alongside others from their community. They might make the pilgrimage in connection with one of the three regular festivals (Passover, Weeks, and Tabernacles), since each of these was also set around harvest times for various crops. The amount offered was not critical, as it was representative of the whole crop.

The procedure is stated cryptically, so the sequence of the ceremony is ambiguous. The implied order is that the farmer hands his basket to the priest at the entrance of the court, declaring that this is the evidence that God has fulfilled his promise to bring the people to the land. The priest takes the basket to the altar in the court and sets it down. The farmer then makes confession of God's redemption to the priest and picks up the basket beside the altar (v. 10), declaring that he has fulfilled the obligation of the firstfruits. Both the priest and the farmer are involved in these actions.

<span id="page-247-3"></span><span id="page-247-2"></span><span id="page-247-1"></span><span id="page-247-0"></span>26:5–11 The confession at the giving of the firstfruits recounts the story of Israel, beginning with Jacob, who went to Egypt near the end of his life, at the age of 130. He described all his years as few and full of trouble (Gen. 47:9). All this is summarized by saying that Jacob was a "wandering [or "perishing"; *'obed*] Aramean" (Deut. 26:5). The ambiguity of the word *'obed* appropriately describes the life of Jacob. His life was one of wandering, as he was driven to his uncle Laban in the land of Paddan-aram to escape the fury of his brother. He lived much of his life in light of the deception of his sons, who led him to believe the child of his beloved Rachel was dead. Only as he was dying did his family come to be reunited, and even then in a foreign land. His wanderings extended from Paddan-aram to Egypt, most of them in sorrow and the shadow of death. But the farmer now makes triumphant declaration of how the mercy of God has prevailed. Jacob has become a great nation, and the slavery of Egypt has turned into the opportunity of a land oozing with milk and honey. This is therefore a time of joy and celebration for everyone, including those who do not have actual property in the land but can enjoy all its benefits.

<span id="page-247-5"></span><span id="page-247-4"></span>26:12–15 The tithe of the third year is holy (v. 13). This is no longer like the food that was eaten every day, just as the bread and wine on the communion table

are not just bread and wine any longer. As long as the bread and wine are on the communion table, they are not to be eaten as ordinary food. Every third year in each settlement, one tenth of the entire crop took on the same sacred character. The farmer made a vow that he had purged his storehouses entirely of that tenth, which belonged to God. It would of course be eaten, but not as the food that is eaten every day. It was another of means by which God provided for the Levite and the settler that did not have land, as well as those who had suffered the loss of a provider for the family.

The tithe was further declared holy in that it was kept pure from any ceremonial contamination, which would be offensive to the confession that God is holy and the giver of all that sustains life. "Unclean" is in some way representative of death. Partaking of the tithe while in mourning or after touching a dead body would be a direct contradiction of the purpose of the tithe. Giving of the tithe to the dead is likely a reference to some other worship. All idols are regarded as dead since they have no substance. The celebration of the life God gives through the food he provides must not be compromised.

<span id="page-248-3"></span><span id="page-248-2"></span><span id="page-248-1"></span><span id="page-248-0"></span>26:16–19 These verses hold a double function: they conclude the two major sections of the second speech of Moses, namely, the prologue and the stipulations, and they transition to the blessings and curses that conclude the instruction of Moses. The emphasis is on "this day" (v. 16), the time Moses is speaking to the Israelites on the plains of Moab. This thought is continued in 28:1, where Moses begins with the need to remember "today" that the Lord has set the Israelites apart from the nations. The transition to the blessings and curses concludes with the declaration that they are a holy people (26:19). The divine declaration is not just illocutionary, as suggested by the translation "the Lord has declared today that you are a people for his treasured possession." The verb is causative in Hebrew, meaning that God has brought the people to the place where they are able to declare the words of the oath. They have been empowered by the mercy of God to make the statement that they are a treasured people, set apart to God as holy.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-248-4"></span>The responsibility to make a confession of thanksgiving and to fulfill the tithe in caring for the poor is one of the ways Israel distinguishes itself as a holy people. These activities are an integral part of what it means to be spiritual. The apostle Paul says as much in describing the apostate condition of mankind in Romans 1:18–21. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all those who hold the truth in unrighteousness. The invisible nature of God is clearly known from creation through the things made, even his power and divine nature. Knowing God, rebellious humans did not glorify him as God, neither were they thankful. This is understandable: those who deny God believe in some sense that they are autonomous and self-sufficient, on par with god, and therefore that there is no reason to give thanks. This tends to be characteristic of our world, which has many demands of entitlements but feels no need to give thanks for anything. What is not understandable is the attitude of those who believe life and its provisions are a gift from God but are not thankful, or at least never declare their thanks in a public way.

The importance of thanksgiving must not be minimized. Those who believe that humans do not live by bread alone should be particularly thoughtful about giving thanks for food. The logical time to do so is when participating in a meal. A particularly significant time to do so is when participating in a meal in a public setting. This is the most powerful way to give testimony to faith. In Israel this was to be done immediately at the beginning of harvest. Apart from the ceremony of this chapter, which is specifically a declaration of thanksgiving, declaring the provision of God was a part of the beginning of the harvest at Passover, the end of the grain harvest at the Feast of Weeks, and the completion of all harvesting at Tabernacles. In the same way Christians need to make thanksgiving a regular part of worship.

<span id="page-249-3"></span>An important concept is that tithes that belong to God are holy, which means they function in the world of the common to represent the creator of the world, who provides all things. Malachi has it right when he declares the people to be under a curse because they have robbed God in tithes and offerings (Mal. 3:8–9). Malachi is referring to a specific obligation pertaining to his time. His readers would be expected to know what amount was required in their circumstance and would be readily able to calculate their shortfall. Their failure brought them under judgment.

<span id="page-249-2"></span><span id="page-249-0"></span>The OT contains various instructions concerning the practice of the tithe. The different instructions for the tithe appear to pertain to changing circumstances. Differences include both the collection of the tithe and its distribution. In Leviticus and Numbers the tithe is specified for the Levites and priests in support of their work of the place of meeting (Num. 18:20–32; cf. Lev. 27:30–33). Deuteronomy 26:12–15 refers to one specific tithe, that of the poor calculated in the third year. The amount is the gross income of the crop when harvested. Tithing under the covenant of Moses pertains both to the support of temple personnel and to support for the poor. Deuteronomy says the tithe is to be taken to the central place, where it is eaten by both the poor and the Levites (12:5–19). Deuteronomy 14:22–29 further states that the tithe can be converted to money when food could be purchased at the proper place. The tithe of the third year is in a different category altogether. These regulations are not harmonized with those found in Leviticus and Numbers.

<span id="page-249-5"></span><span id="page-249-1"></span>Christians live in a different situation, in which they have a primary obligation to the church and its work, which includes help for the poor. Paul says Christians should work to be able to give more (Eph. 4:28). The goal of life is to be as generous as possible in all circumstances.68 Governments of advanced economies levy many kinds of taxes, which may amount to about half of personal earnings.69 Money

<span id="page-249-4"></span><sup>68</sup> For understanding grace in Christian giving (2 Cor. 8:7) an excellent resource is Iain Duguid, *Should Christians Tithe? Excelling in the Grace of Giving*, (Glenside: PA: St. Colme's, 2018), e-book.

<sup>69</sup> According the Fraser Institute, Tax Freedom Day in Canada in 2019, the time in the year by which the average worker had worked long enough to pay that year's tax burden, was June 14.

<span id="page-250-0"></span>that is taxed is owed to the government; it falls outside of discretionary income from which donations may be made. Governments may allow some of its taxes to be deducted by virtue of a donation receipt, which is a way to channel some extra giving. Christians must be able to say, "I have removed the sacred portion out of my house, and moreover, I have given it to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all your commandment that you have commanded me" (Deut. 26:13). Great joy is found in exercising such spirituality, and great blessing is promised to those engaging in this holy act.

### <span id="page-250-1"></span>DEUTERONOMY 27:1–26

27 Now Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, "Keep the whole commandment that I command you today. **<sup>2</sup>**And on the day you cross over the Jordan to the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall set up large stones and plaster them with plaster. **3**And you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you cross over to enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised you. **4**And when you have crossed over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, concerning which I command you today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster. **5**And there you shall build an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones.

**<sup>9</sup>**Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, "Keep silence and hear, O Israel: this day you have become the people of the Lord your God. **<sup>10</sup>**You shall therefore obey the voice of the Lord your God, keeping his commandments and his statutes, which I command you today."

**<sup>11</sup>**That day Moses charged the people, saying, **<sup>12</sup>** "When you have crossed over the Jordan, these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. **13**And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. **14**And the Levites shall declare to all the men of Israel in a loud voice:

#### *Section Overview: Covenant Ceremony at Shechem*

<span id="page-251-4"></span><span id="page-251-3"></span><span id="page-251-2"></span>Chapter 26 concludes by declaring, "He will set you in praise and in fame and in honor high above all nations that he has made" (v. 19). Chapter 28 resumes the sermon with the words "The Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth" (28:1). The covenant words of the second sermon conclude with the blessings and curses in chapter 28, as is typical of covenant form. Chapter 27 interrupts the covenant words with instructions for the enactment of the ceremony in Shechem. When scribes inserted relevant material into a narrative text, the beginning and the end of the insertion are marked by what has been termed a resumptive repetition. The scribes used this technique to set apart intervening material. Another obvious example of this is the insertion of the genealogy of Moses and Aaron in the exodus account (Ex. 6:14–26). No conclusions can be drawn about when these instructions were included within the covenant. These instructions may have come from Moses, just as the genealogy in Exodus might have been from Moses, or they may have come from another source. The goal was to include them in the teaching of Moses in Moab. This was the logical place to insert them within the words of the covenant, as the insertion pertains to how the act of affirming the blessings and curses will be carried out.

<span id="page-251-6"></span><span id="page-251-5"></span><span id="page-251-0"></span>Chapter 27 is an abrupt shift in form to instructions for the ceremony that will eventually be enacted for enforcing the covenant given in Deuteronomy. The form reverts to the third person, describing what Moses commanded the people, the same form found in the epilogue beginning in chapter 29. This ceremony was carried out by Joshua, as narrated in Joshua 8:30–35 and repeated in Joshua 24. The instruction of Moses for the ceremony at Moab shifts to the blessings and

<span id="page-252-2"></span><span id="page-252-0"></span>curses by recalling the words God had spoken at Sinai, setting Israel apart as a nation (Ex. 19:5–6). The assembly was led by God to declare that they were his treasured possession (Deut. 26:18). At Sinai Israel became a holy people, not just one nation among others. The covenant words are resumed after the description of the ceremony itself.

<span id="page-252-6"></span><span id="page-252-4"></span>The crossing of the Jordan is mentioned twice (27:2, 4), each time followed by the dictate to set up stones on which the commandments are to be written. Are the commandments written on the stones of the altar, which must be rough and natural, or are they written on stones that have been appropriately prepared for engraving? Although the question is vigorously debated, the text makes clear that the commandments are engraved for perpetuity and proper burnt offerings and community offerings are made on the altar. The stones in verse 8 should not be understood as the altar stones; they are the stones of verses 2–4. The inscription of the Torah is made upon these stones. The altar ceremony is included as a part of the rite for inscribing the stones. The scribes have inserted it within the account so that verses 4 and 8 are an inclusio around the altar description. The altar sacrifice is a separate event from the act of inscribing the Torah on pitched stone. Altars are not the place for inscriptions.

<span id="page-252-8"></span><span id="page-252-7"></span><span id="page-252-5"></span>Procedures for the ceremony at Ebal and Gerizim describe the making of a covenant in which blessings and curses are declared (vv. 9–13). Nothing is said about the content of these blessings and curses. The curses that follow in verses 14–26 are a part of a third ceremony in which anyone breaking the covenant that has been sworn is anathematized. This is carried out by the Levites; the assembly responds only with an "Amen" of affirmation. These two sections should not be read as part of the same ceremony.

<span id="page-252-1"></span>The ceremonies at Shechem are one with the teaching of Moses in Moab. The chapter is a bridge within the teaching of the covenant, which ends with this theme in chapter 26 and takes it up at the beginning of chapter 28. It is likely that all three ceremonies—the altar sacrifices, the declaration of the Torah, and the anathema—took place on the occasion when Israel established the altar at Shechem.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-252-3"></span>27:1–3 The enactment of the covenant is ambiguous regarding various questions. As is evident in translation, the stones are to be set up on the day when the people cross the Jordan. It is impossible to travel from Gilgal, the point where Israel enters the land, to Shechem in one day. Joshua carries out the ceremony after the conquest of Jericho and Ai, which must be the intended sense, despite the way the account reads.

"All the words of this law" includes everything that is part of the second sermon of Moses. Inscribing in stone the words that are to endure as public reference was a common way of permanently publicizing a text. The use of plaster would be much less durable, giving the impression that this law is a temporary provision for consulting the words of the teaching of Moses once they enter the land. It may be assumed that upon entry of the land Israel would not have the luxury afforded established empires to publicize documents engraved in stone.

<span id="page-253-4"></span><span id="page-253-3"></span><span id="page-253-1"></span>27:4–8 The altar at Shechem is a contradiction to the requirement of Deuteronomy that worship be at the one place God will choose, but it is interpreted as a temporary provision before the establishment of the tabernacle at Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). Shiloh is the location where the land is allocated once it is subdued (Josh. 18:8–10). Just as there is some time between the entrance to the land and the covenant ceremony at Shechem, more time will be required before a more permanent place can be found for the tabernacle. The altar at Shechem is the immediate but temporary location of worship.

Mount Ebal is on the north side of the valley above Shechem. It is the highest mountain in the vicinity, with a height of over 3,000 feet (900 m), providing a commanding view of the Promised Land: Hermon to the north, Jordan and Gilead to the east, the hills of Jerusalem to the south, and the Mediterranean to the west. This may be what makes it ideal for a ceremony celebrating Israel's arrival in the land. The altar built there follows the requirements of Sinai given in Exodus 20:24–26. Altars made for God must have no appearance of the craft of idolatry. The peace offering celebrates the well-being of the community. It is the only offering consumed largely by those making the offering and thus is most appropriate for celebration.

<span id="page-253-2"></span><span id="page-253-0"></span>27:9–13 The division of tribes in the covenant ceremony places the central tribes of Judah and the northern hill country on Mount Gerizim; the more peripheral tribes of Galilee and those across the Jordan are stationed on Mount Ebal. The expressions used for the blessing and the curse are significantly different from each other. The tribes on Gerizim proclaim a blessing for the people or make a declaration blessing the people. The tribes on Ebal stand as supervisors or observers of the curse. To "stand . . . for the curse" is a circumlocution to avoid the sense that someone is being cursed. The import of the actions is not expressly given. Perhaps each group acts only as an audience for the other, or they may be acting on behalf of everyone. The intent may be that the group on Gerizim pronounces a blessing on the assembly while the group on Ebal stands as representatives for the curse. The blessings and curses are the divinely imposed consequences of obedience or rebellion, life or death.

<span id="page-254-0"></span>Nothing is said about the actual contents of the blessings and the curses, but Deuteronomy 11:27–29 states that these are circumstantial descriptions of reward and punishment. They declare the results of obedience or disobedience of the covenant stipulations in specified situations, as is typical of covenant ceremonies.

<span id="page-254-3"></span>27:14 This verse introduces the Levites who will speak to all the assembly of Israel in a loud voice. This stands in contrast to the division of tribes on Gerizim and Ebal, in which six tribes speak a blessing and the other six a curse. The Levites are not said to have a distinguished role in those proceedings. In this ceremony the Levites do the speaking and the people make a one-word response. There is no reference to blessings in this ceremony, and no actual curses are laid on anyone. Various actions are interdicted. An oath or imprecation against a person guilty of these actions is declared with the response of "Amen."

<span id="page-254-5"></span>27:15–26 Twelve common prohibitions are given in this list. All but the twelfth comprehensive statement are found in the commandments elsewhere. The first and the last are distinguished in form, though this is obscured in translation. They read "cursed be anyone who . . ." (AT), while the others simply say "cursed be." As the introduction and conclusion, they deal with the sins emphasized the most, namely, idolatry, which violates fundamental allegiance to the holy, and subversion of the teaching that the Holy One has given.

<span id="page-254-4"></span>The ceremony is designed to prevent these offenses and to declare divine punishment for violations. An anathema is pronounced upon anyone who commits them. The response of "Amen" is a commitment by those hearing the words spoken that they will not do these things. All the offenses listed take place in secret and therefore are impossible to detect and punish. The word "secret" is specified in the case of making an idol (v. 15) and striking a fellow citizen (v. 24). The most sinister of idolatries and assaults are done clandestinely; these are the ones intended here. The other crimes are also secret in nature: cursing parents, moving a boundary, misleading the blind, subverting justice, engaging in sexual sin, and taking a bribe to cover up murder. This is an appropriate warning and oath once the people have entered the land. There can be no thought of feigning allegiance to the sovereign God who has shown such mercy and granted them the privilege of land.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-254-2"></span><span id="page-254-1"></span>The ceremonies at Shechem are set in the context of Israel's pondering its role as the people who belong to God (27:9–10). The events at Shechem establish the profound significance of what has happened in Moab. "Keep silence" translates a word used only in verse 9 and is otherwise found only in the Akkadian word *sakātu*. The command is significant not only to Israel but to the church. The distinction of Israel as the nation of priests informs the identity and calling of the church. This is a sacred responsibility that must be remembered every hour and minute.

Deuteronomy makes the establishment of the identity of the people of God central to its message. The teaching of the Ten Words and the exhortation to love <span id="page-255-1"></span>and fear God were concluded with the directive that Israel would carry out the covenant ceremony at Shechem (11:29–30). Chapter 27 returns to more detailed information concerning this covenant ceremony as the exposition of this Torah concludes. The inclusion of the ceremony at Shechem binds together the terms of the covenant as a cohesive unit. It joins the prologue of the covenant (chs. 5–11) to the exposition (chs. 12–26), and it points forward to the time in the Promised Land at which Israel will take the vow of obedience.

<span id="page-255-2"></span><span id="page-255-0"></span>The three ceremonies prescribed in this chapter are critical to the spiritual life of Israel. The burnt offerings are a declaration of giving to God the life he has given to them. Such sacrifices provide no personal benefit to anyone. The peace offerings are communal. They are holy in that they belong to God, but they are eaten as a communal meal in drawing the assembly together in unity and equality. The taking of a vow over the written commandments is a declaration of commitment to doing the will of God as a holy people. The ceremony of anathema is a warning to remember that there is no escaping the consequences of the breaking of the covenant. Choosing to reject God does not mean that he will no longer be involved in the life of the disobedient person. God is with his people in either the blessing or the curse.

<span id="page-255-5"></span>The church as the people of God performs all of these same functions. Sacrifices for the Christian are expressed in praise (Heb. 13:15–16). These sacrifices are the confession of our lips and the sharing of good deeds, sacrifices that are well-pleasing to God. True worship, according to James, is to care for the orphans and the widows (James 1:27), but this does not displace the good confession (1 Tim. 3:15– 16). The church is a pillar of truth, the unshakeable work of God (Gk, *hedraiōma*, "buttress"; 1 Tim. 3:15). Great is the confession of the mystery of godliness:

<span id="page-255-4"></span><span id="page-255-3"></span> He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.

An early Christian song such as this has its continuation in modern hymns that declare the same mystery of faith. Ponder the words of Michael Perry:

 Then hear, O gracious Saviour, accept the love we bring, that we who know your favour may serve you as our king; and whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill, we'll triumph through our sorrows and rise to bless you still:

 to marvel at your beauty and glory in your ways, and make a joyful duty our sacrifice of praise.70

The sacrifices made to sing these profound words are no less worthy than all those associated with the making of the vows of the covenant at Shechem.

<span id="page-256-0"></span>The church also has its anathemas. Paul offers a stern warning for the Galatians. If anyone should declare a gospel contrary to what they have received, even if it be a messenger from heaven, "Let him be accursed [*anathema*]" (Gal. 1:8, 9). Paul concludes his first letter to the Corinthians in his own hand with the words, "If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed [*anathema*]" (1 Cor. 16:21–22). But it is not only denial of the truth that leads to anathema. In 1 Corinthians 5:11 Paul writes instructions not to associate with anyone called a brother who is a fornicator, a drunkard, or a swindler, or who is greedy, idolatrous, or abusive; the Corinthians are not even to eat with such a person. The church must distinguish between those who claim membership in its ranks just as Israel did. Conduct contrary to the covenant is a denial of the covenant.

#### *Section Overview: Covenant Blessings and Curses*

<span id="page-258-3"></span><span id="page-258-2"></span><span id="page-258-1"></span>The blessings and curses of this chapter are typical of those found in other treaties. The list of blessings is short in comparison to the curses. The blessings and curses of the first section of the chapter (28:1–44) are deliberately arranged. The chapter begins with a resumption of the declaration of the covenant in Moab (v. 1) and then declares three pairs of comprehensive blessings (vv. 2–6). The second pair is amplified with explanation. These are the kind of pronouncements that might be made by an official. They have corresponding declarative curses (vv. 15–19). The blessings are followed by promises of prosperity (vv. 7–14). The corresponding list of threats is considerably amplified (vv. 20–44). The threats are extended with two further sections, which conclude with a reversal of Israel's situation. Instead of living in the land, they will be in exile.

<span id="page-258-10"></span><span id="page-258-8"></span><span id="page-258-6"></span><span id="page-258-5"></span><span id="page-258-4"></span>The long list of curses in this chapter breaks down into three sections: blessings countered by amplification of corresponding curses (vv. 1–44), horrors of siege warfare (vv. 45–57), and despair of exile (vv. 58–68). All of these evils are assured if the oath of the covenant is not kept; the oath is broken if the people place faith in some other god than Yahweh. Faithfulness in the covenant relationship will make them a people holy to God (v. 9), those called by the name of the Lord (v. 10). The way of trust will not be easy; the danger of turning to something else will always be present (v. 14). As Moses warned in chapter 6, both riches (28:10–15) and poverty (vv. 16–19) can be temptations, either to trust in one's own strength or to test God. The force of these anathemas and gruesome description of consequences is to generate vigilance against the deception of forgetting the oath taken.

<span id="page-258-9"></span><span id="page-258-7"></span><span id="page-258-0"></span>Many scholars believe that the general sequence of the threats in 28:23–37 and some of the verbal similarity to the vassal treaty of Esarhaddon indicate that the scribes of these curses had access to a copy of that treaty and made use of it in developing the curses of the covenant in Deuteronomy. Paragraphs 63–64 of Esarhaddon's treaty ask the gods to "shrink the ground to the size of a brick for you. May they make your ground like iron so that nothing sprouts from it. Just as rain does not fall from a

sky of bronze, so may rain and dew not visit your fields and meadows. Instead of rain, may charcoal fall on your land."71 While such verbal similarity cannot demonstrate scribal dependence on this treaty, it does show that the curses of Deuteronomy are a common literary form in ancient Near Eastern culture. This genre would be familiar at virtually any period of Israel's history and would have communicated forcefully.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-259-2"></span><span id="page-259-1"></span><span id="page-259-0"></span>28:1 This verse resumes the sermon in Moab in which Moses is teaching Israel about its covenant with Yahweh. This is a repetition of 26:18–19; those verses were the conclusion of a transition in the sermon from an exposition of the stipulations to the announcement of consequences (26:16–19). In transitioning to the consequences of keeping the covenant, Moses reminds the assembly of its special calling as a treasured people.

<span id="page-259-3"></span>28:2 The pronouncement of blessings is stated in the form of agency: "all these blessings shall come upon you" (v. 2). This is not full personification, since it is evident that God is the agent bringing about these actions. But this does emphasize the result of knowing and following the will of God.

<span id="page-259-4"></span>28:3–6 The blessings are stated in three pairs that are a type of merism; that is, they include everything in their scope. The first is stated in terms of location: city and field; the second in terms of fecundity: animals and crops; the third in terms of activity: when you come and when you go. The middle pair is expanded by

<sup>71</sup> A translation of the treaty with helpful commentary and notes may be consulted in Jacob Lauinger, *COS*, 4.36. The treaty consists of about 670 lines and is sealed with three divine seals of the Assyrian national god Assur, not just the usual seals of the vassal taking the oath.

describing the fertility of the two main agricultural animals (bovine and sheep: calving and lambing) and the gathering and preparation of food (basket and kneading bowl). Both will be in abundance. The last pair is a generic expression inclusive of all activity, domestic and public, individual and collective. The blessings are inclusive in every way.

<span id="page-260-2"></span>28:7–8 The concisely stated blessings are elaborated by divine promises. The blessings do not come as a kind of natural consequence but are the direct result of divine action. One kind of coming and going encompasses war and the necessity of self-defense against the enemy that rises against them. God will provide for their protection. The second promise elaborates God's provision in the country and the city. Storage for food will be abundant; the generic word for storage indicates every kind of crop. God will bless "all that you undertake" (v. 8). God will not only give them the land but bless them in it.

<span id="page-260-4"></span><span id="page-260-3"></span>28:9–10 These verses return to the motif that introduces the blessings and curses. To be a holy people involves a dedicated calling that sets Israel apart from the life of all other nations in the common. The name of the Lord is known through these people. To be the means of knowing the name of the Lord is not a part of ordinary activity in the world; it is a high calling that extends the significance of their world to that which is *outside* the world, to the one who has given life to them and to all things in the world.

<span id="page-260-5"></span>28:11–13a The Lord will grant Israel a surplus from their animals and fields. Life and the food that sustains it come from another dimension, here called "the heavens." There is no such thing as "Mother Nature." Such an expression is the hubris of a culture that presumes human autonomy. The nation that knows its dependence on God will be the one that lends to others. They will be the ones who take the lead since their destiny is sure.

<span id="page-260-6"></span>28:13b–14 The condition of blessing is mutable. Loyalty to God cannot be compromised. This is both complex and profound. As the curses anticipate, the profundity of such loyalty is beyond the ability of Israel to grasp, both intellectually and volitionally. Israel will find ways to rationalize fatal compromise of this requirement. The blessings begin and end with virtually the same words (cf. vv. 1, 13b). Such words are another way of stating the agency of the blessings; they are in no sense a natural consequence, and they cannot be manipulated in any way.

<span id="page-260-7"></span><span id="page-260-1"></span><span id="page-260-0"></span>28:15–19 These lines are the converse of the opening (vv. 2–5). They employ the same expression in saying that the curses will "overtake" the people. The intended effect of the curses is seen in the response of King Josiah in hearing the content of the Torah (2 Kings 22:11, 19): he tears his garments and repents.

<span id="page-260-9"></span><span id="page-260-8"></span>28:20–24 The evils sent by Yahweh are introduced with a triad of terms that are alliterative in Hebrew, describing the effect on the people: curse, panic, and futility. These are a natural sequence. The noun "curse" (*me'erah*) is from the root of the verbal form "cursed" (*'arur*). Living under the curse leads to turmoil, a confusion of mind, and an inability to know what to do. This is what happens in war or the breakdown of social order. Inability to plan any sensible course of action leads to futility and frustration. Every option is a bad one, and there is no way forward for improvement. Such a condition extends to everything the hand may touch, the same expression used in verse 8. The result is complete annihilation.

<span id="page-261-1"></span>The pestilence that will not leave them is described with seven terms. There are no exact referents for these terms, nor is it even possible to know if they all refer to human ailments or if the last four pertain to crops, as interpreted by the ESV. The Masoretic Text reads "sword" (*hereb*) for "drought" (*hareb*), a meaning for the lexeme *hrb* that seems unlikely in this list, though war is the subject following drought (vv. 25–26). If all seven terms are interpreted as human afflictions, the last four terms would refer to illnesses of fever, heat, sallowness (yellowish skin), and jaundice. The ESV assumes a transition to drought, which is the result of a sky of bronze that rains dust.

<span id="page-261-7"></span><span id="page-261-3"></span><span id="page-261-2"></span>28:25–26 The threat of defeat in battle is the reverse of Israel's victory in battle (cf. v. 7). Corpses left on the battlefield for the consumption of wild animals is a stock motif in military rhetoric (1 Sam. 17:43–46). It is an appalling image to think of scavengers' tearing at human bodies the way one observes vultures at roadkill. Deuteronomy 28:26 is identical to Jeremiah 7:33; this curse is found six times in the prose sermons of Jeremiah. Jeremiah 7 is known as the temple sermon, in which Jeremiah uses covenant formulations drawn from Deuteronomy to warn Judah of the coming end of Jerusalem.

<span id="page-261-9"></span><span id="page-261-4"></span><span id="page-261-0"></span>28:27–29 Seven human sicknesses are named in these verses; four have to do with skin rash or eruption while three describe a mental disorder. The first is a skin inflammation referred to in the plagues (Ex. 9:9). The second is vocalized (read in the synagogue) as hemorrhoids, which is the way it is interpreted in the LXX. Itch and scab are a type of skin disease (dermatitis).

<span id="page-261-10"></span><span id="page-261-8"></span>The three terms for madness are found in Zechariah 12:4, where the curse against Israel is turned on her enemies. Madness is the term that describes David in feigning insanity while seeking to avoid the wrath of Achish, king of Gath (1 Sam. 21:13–16). Bewilderment or confusion describes the horses in Zechariah. Blindness in these contexts is to be taken metaphorically; it describes people unable to think logically because they cannot see what is right. The image is of Israel groping to find its way even in the light of noon, like a blind man or a person in the dark. The horrors of chronic disease and war leave their victims robbed and abused, deprived of sense and bewildered, unable to see light regardless of how they try to plan.

<span id="page-261-6"></span><span id="page-261-5"></span>28:30–34 A theme of helplessness characterizes the content of these threats. Social order will break down as marriage is violated (Deut. 28:30); the plunder of war will disrupt the establishment of a new home (v. 30). Victims will be powerless

<span id="page-262-5"></span><span id="page-262-4"></span><span id="page-262-3"></span>when their children are taken in captivity (v. 32); they will be abused and crushed as others consume their harvest (v. 33) until they are driven to madness (v. 34), as stated in the list of illnesses (v. 28). Even those essential life events that could exempt a soldier from battle will be desecrated (cf. 20:5–7). The loss of children in war is indescribable; eyes are exhausted in tears.

<span id="page-262-9"></span><span id="page-262-6"></span><span id="page-262-0"></span>28:35–37 Debilitating skin disease and exile are in store for those who do not keep faith. The effect of this disease is like that suffered by Job (Job 2:7). It is chronic, if not fatal, and affects the whole body. The description is like that of small pox, an extremely contagious and deadly viral disease. Since the time of ancient Egypt, small pox has been one of the deadliest diseases among humans. Fever and pain are followed by a rash that develops into abscesses filled with pus, leaving scars.

Four Israelite kings are eventually exiled: Hoshea to Assyria, Jehoahaz to Egypt, and Jehoiachin and Zedekiah to Babylon. Beginning with the exile of northern Israel to areas of the Tigris, Israelites come to be in exile everywhere from southern Egypt to Persia. The demise of Israel will be an example known and taunted among the nations.

<span id="page-262-7"></span><span id="page-262-1"></span>28:38–42 One pair of blessings was fertility, the fruit of the womb and of the land (Deut. 28:4). This blessing was expanded to describe the fecundity of animals and harvest. It is utterly negated in these verses. The land will become a possession of crickets. Only insects will survive the devastation.

<span id="page-262-8"></span><span id="page-262-2"></span>28:43–44 These curses and threats reverse the state of the blessing given in verses 12–13. Israel will fall into perpetual need, always needing to borrow. The settlers in their place will be the ones who are prosperous.

#### *Response*

Blessings and curses as found at the conclusion of the covenant are strange to the contemporary reader, but this would be an expected format for about a millennium beginning before Moses and extending to the end of the Assyrian period. This reality of covenant would have been familiar to Israel from Moses until the exile. It may also seem strange that the blessings are so few and general in comparison to the curses. This feature would also not be surprising. The main benefit of keeping the treaty was to avoid the punishment. In many ancient Near Eastern treaties, blessings are omitted. But a lengthy list is always included of curses invoked upon violation of the treaty. These are inflictions of the gods outside the control of the lord making the treaty—the essence of a curse.

One example is the first curse by Barga'yah, king of a territory near Aleppo, against the king of Arpad: "(seven rams shall tup) a ewe, but let her not conceive."72 The curses invariably declare the utter destruction of the unfaithful party, with

<sup>72</sup> Sefire I (a treaty between two eighth-century kings in Syria written in old Aramaic), line 21. Cf. John C. L. Gibson, *Textbook of Syrian Semitic Inscriptions*, vol. 2, *Aramaic InscriptionsIncluding Inscriptions in the Dialect of Zenjirli*  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), 29. A helpful commentary on this treaty is found in Gibson, 18–56. This treaty contains only curses.

great pain and distress. As Barga'yah warns, "Just as this piece of wax is burned with fire, so shall Arpad and [her daughter cities] be utterly burned."73 The purpose of curses is intimidation. The gods of ancient times are always unpredictable. The god of the suzerain may abandon him, in which case the curses would be impotent. This could be viewed as an occasion to rebel. Deuteronomy must be read in a theological context. Israel has experienced the frightful presence of Yahweh; Moses has reminded the nation of its fear at the mountain. The people must love and fear God always. The curses of this book are inevitable if the covenant is not obeyed.

A treaty known all over the world of the late Assyrian Empire was promulgated by Esarhaddon in 672 BC. This treaty was to ensure that Esarhaddon's son Assurbanipal would be his successor, even though he was a younger son. Copies of this treaty were made with vassal states throughout Esarhaddon's empire. Archaeological excavation in the Syrian temple at Tell Taʻyinat shows that a copy of the treaty was placed vertically in the throne room of the god so that it could be read by walking around it. The date of the treaty was during the time of Manasseh. Given the idolatries of that king, it is likely that this treaty was also placed in the temple in Jerusalem at the demand of Esarhaddon. It may have displaced the ark and the covenant words of Deuteronomy contained in it. The treaty text is notable for its length and state of preservation. A further notable feature is that copies of the treaty like that found at Tell Taʻyinat are officially inscribed with seals declaring it to be the national god Assur's "Seal of Destinies."74 This seal made the stipulations of the treaty the immutable destiny of the person taking the oath. If Esarhaddon's treaty was one of the items purged from the temple during Josiah's cleansing described in 2 Kings 22:8–20, the reader can only imagine the consternation caused when king, priest, and people realized that God had made just such a treaty with Moses, which they had broken. The form of Deuteronomy was significant in its impact long after its being inscribed on prepared stones at Shechem.

<span id="page-263-1"></span><span id="page-263-0"></span>The last warning of Scripture concludes with a curse derived from the words of Deuteronomy. John bears testimony against all who read the words of his prophecy written in his book (Rev. 22:18–20). If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues written in the book. These plagues include not only the last judgment in the lake of fire but also the inflictions incurred by the ungodly throughout the time prior to that judgment. The warning is primarily directed not to those *outside* the church community but specifically *to* the church community, just as the curses of Deuteronomy were directed toward Israel. Those who do not heed the warnings may profess to be Christians, but their deeds show that their allegiance is not to Christ. They not only suffer the loss of their inheritance but also experience the suffering of all those that follow the beast.

**<sup>45</sup>** "All these curses shall come upon you and pursue you and overtake you till you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you. **46**They shall be a sign and a wonder against you and your offspring forever. **47**Because you did not serve the Lord your God with joyfulness and gladness of heart, because of the abundance of all things, **<sup>48</sup>** therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the Lord will send against you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness, and lacking everything.

#### *Section Overview: War and Exile*

<span id="page-265-2"></span>The threats that will reduce Israel to being the least of all nations are further developed in a sequence of events that will reverse the entrance to the land now underway. Through war and plagues Israel will return the way they have come. They will be in exile as they were in Egypt. Two transitional verses divide this section into two topics. Deuteronomy 28:45 is a transitional recapitulation of verse 15, forming an inclusio around the curses. Proof of the disobedience of Israel will be evident through invasion and siege warfare. The horrors of such warfare are graphically described. Verse 58 repeats the condition of obedience and transitions to the decimation of Israel and its ultimate exile.

<span id="page-265-6"></span><span id="page-265-5"></span><span id="page-265-4"></span><span id="page-265-3"></span><span id="page-265-1"></span><span id="page-265-0"></span>The threats of this section are given in terms reminiscent of Israel's experience in the bondage of Egypt. The plagues that led to the liberation of Israel were to be a proof of the presence of Yahweh forever, which they would perpetually tell their children in the celebration of the Passover and redemption from Egypt (Ex. 10:1–2). In contrast, the proof of disobeying the Torah will be seen by all nations in Israel's decimation, a perpetual testimony to their descendants (Deut. 28:46). Israel will once again enter bondage in service to its enemies (v. 48), and all the diseases of Egypt will come upon them (v. 60). Instead of being as numerous as the stars of heaven, they will be few in number, as when they entered Egypt. Finally, they will be taken back to Egypt, where they will sell themselves into

<span id="page-266-10"></span>slavery (v. 68). Failure to keep the Torah will be the reversal of the blessing of receiving this Torah.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-266-5"></span><span id="page-266-4"></span><span id="page-266-0"></span>28:45–48 Curses will overtake Israel—the last clause of verse 15 becomes the first clause of verse 45. The structure is almost poetic. Verse 45 serves as a conclusion to the preceding threats and an introduction to the signs and proofs to follow. Signs and proofs are the terms used for the ten plagues (4:34; 6:22). These disasters will be proofs of the disobedience of Israel, a warning that it is impossible to escape the consequences of failure to uphold loyalty to God.

The yoke is a picture of an animal in service pulling a load. Usually yokes were made of wood, but this one is of iron. The iron yoke amplifies the harshness of the servitude and the inability to escape from it.

<span id="page-266-6"></span>28:49–51 War will descend like the swoop of an eagle. The speed and power of the attack will capture Israel as a victim, just as the prey of an eagle. War is ruthless; there is no respect for its victims, whether young or old. It brings devastation. Produce of land and animals will be lost. The terminology repeats that of the blessings (vv. 4–5), though it does not include the fruit of the womb. In the gruesome description of the famine of siege (vv. 54–57), cannibalism produces food that will not be shared.

<span id="page-266-9"></span><span id="page-266-8"></span><span id="page-266-7"></span><span id="page-266-2"></span><span id="page-266-1"></span>28:52–57 Trust in high walls is a fatal failure (v. 52). Trust in military strength is among the warnings issued to the future king (17:16). The very walls in which Israel trusts under siege become a prison that forces the people of the city into starvation.

The desperation of starvation during time of siege is described in horrifying detail. All respect for humanity and natural affection of family are subordinated to a desperate quest for survival. People are reduced to cannibalism; husbands and wives turn against each other; the most pampered of women turn to the most disgusting of foods. The desperation of cannibalism is described in the siege of Samaria, in which a woman complains to the king that she has shared her child

<span id="page-267-4"></span><span id="page-267-3"></span>with a neighbor, but now that neighbor has hid her child and will not share it (2 Kings 6:28–29). The natural appetite of the invader (Deut. 28:51) and the extreme desperate behavior of Israel (v. 53) make for a drastic contrast. But Israel must never be mistaken about the cause of this desperate distress. These enemies do not act independently of the sovereignty of Yahweh, who has sent them from a distant land. Israel has not been abandoned by God; rather, this is a sign that God remembers his oath.

<span id="page-267-5"></span>28:58 The reference to "this book" anticipates that Moses will write down all of these instructions, which will be ever present to teach Israel. The purpose of this book, which contains all these warnings, is to generate fear. Israel must fear the name, which is a way of saying that they must fear God himself. Fear of God is a good thing, for it will be the way in which Israel learns to love God and keep his commandments.

<span id="page-267-6"></span>28:59–62 Israel will be decimated by disease. This is a consequence of siege, in which people are confined without food or space. Decaying corpses allow rodents and disease-carrying pests to multiply. The diseases of Egypt are just a sample of the suffering that will come to Israel. The inclusion of things not written is a stock motif in ancient writing.

<span id="page-267-8"></span><span id="page-267-7"></span><span id="page-267-1"></span>28:63–68 The "delight" of the Lord is a euphemism used to express the resolve of the divine will—that which is determined by the purpose and character of God. The expression is meant to connote not a feeling of joy but a purpose of mind. Israel's turning to other gods will result in exile to a distant land, where they will be compelled to serve other gods. Instead of coming into a land that will be its resting place (3:20; 12:10), Israel will be in a foreign land, where it can never find a place of rest (v. 65). Israel will be brought to a place of longing, despondency, and agitation (v. 65). The lives of the people will be suspended (Hb. *tala'*; "shall hang"); they will never know from one day to another what their future may be. By day they will long for the rest of night, but the agitation and worry of a sleepless night will make them long for the morning. Just as it was the resolve of God to bring his people to the Promised Land, so also is the curse of their removal from it certain if they do not love and fear him.

<span id="page-267-0"></span>In the final reversal of the history, Israel will return to Egypt and sell themselves as slaves. They will return to the place where God had said they would never go again (Ex. 14:13). Israel does not return as slaves; instead they journey to Egypt by ship and, once there, offer themselves up as slaves. The final indignity is that there will be no one to buy them. This is the ultimate irony: the nation that once refused to let Israel go is now so indifferent that it will not even accept Israel as slaves so that its poverty can be relieved.

<span id="page-267-9"></span><span id="page-267-2"></span>29:1 "These are the words of the covenant" must refer to the words of this Torah, including Deuteronomy 5:6–26:19 and 28:1–68. The words that follow are not the words of a covenant but rather describe the act of making the covenant and <span id="page-268-2"></span><span id="page-268-1"></span><span id="page-268-0"></span>the consequences. This verse restates where the words were spoken and makes clear that said words are expected to become part of a covenant relationship. They form a conclusion to 1:1–5. This verse may be compared to Exodus 31:18, which constitutes a conclusion to Exodus 24:18, where Moses goes up into the mountain to receive words from God. According to Deuteronomy 4:13; 5:2–19, the words of the covenant consisted of the words written on the two tablets of stone. But the words concerning the structure and function of the tabernacle in Exodus and these words in Deuteronomy are also a part of the covenant words Moses received on the mountain. Deuteronomy 29:1 brings the two covenants together, distinguishing them only in time and place. The words of each covenant are of equal standing and are virtually identical. The words at Moab have a covenant relationship as their expected outcome.

<span id="page-268-3"></span>This verse is also transitional to the next section, which anticipates Moses as the covenant mediator. The text of the covenant is found in the previous words of Moses, but the ritual of making the covenant is alluded to in the remainder of the discourse, though it is not actually described. The Hebrew Masoretic Text accordingly makes 29:2 the beginning of the next chapter. The other versions are divided on the break in the text.

#### <span id="page-268-4"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-268-6"></span><span id="page-268-5"></span>The story of Israel was one of covenant disobedience, and so the end of Israel occurred precisely as described in these verses. The city of Jerusalem came under a three-year siege, by which time terrible famine had occurred. The city collapsed and its leaders fled but were captured (2 Kings 25:1–7). The Babylonian king appointed Gedaliah (a member of a noble family of Judah) to rule in Judah (2 Kings 25:22–26). Hatred of the Babylonians resulted in the assassination of Gedaliah. Ishmael (a member of the royal family) and other Judahites had escaped from Jerusalem before the siege began. Ishmael killed numerous other people, including eighty men who had come from Shechem and Shiloh to bring offerings as a rite of mourning (Jer. 41:1–7). The people of Judah, fearful of Babylonian revenge, fled to Egypt and forced Jeremiah and Baruch to go with them (Jer. 43:4–7). All of this was contrary to the word of the Lord as declared by Jeremiah. Even when under the curse of the covenant, the people preferred their own way rather than listening to the word of a prophet. The words of Moses were prophetic in declaring the word of the Lord. The path of disobedience left no doubt that the future of Jerusalem would end in famine and exile.

<span id="page-268-8"></span><span id="page-268-7"></span>The gruesome nature of famine is not exaggerated in these curses, nor is it limited to the methods of ancient warfare. Modern warfare has created the same horrors, except in numbers inconceivable in ancient times. Perhaps the worst of all time was the Soviet-inflicted genocide estimated to have killed up to ten million Ukrainians in 1932–1933, known as Holodomor. The word *holod* means "hunger," and *mor* means "plague"; the expression *moryty holodom* means to "inflict death by hunger." The story of this terror-famine has been documented again with great precision by Anne Applebaum in her book *Red Famine*. 75 Applebaum cites descriptions of this error: "People with swollen legs, covered in sores, could not sit. 'When such a person sat down, the skin broke, liquid began to run down their legs, the smell was awful, and they felt unbearable pain.'"76 Elsewhere she writes, "One woman remembered a girl who was so emaciated that 'one could see how her heart was beating beneath the skin.'"77 Starvation causes the heart to fail, sometimes suddenly and without warning. A child would die while sitting at a school desk. What Applebaum provides that are not found in Deuteronomy are beautiful and ugly plates of numerous scenes of state confiscation and starvation of peasants (farmers). It will not do to attempt to avoid such realities by not talking about them. The truth of Deuteronomy will continue to be repeated because of human pride, pursuit of power, and denial of God, just as in Deuteronomy.

### <span id="page-269-0"></span>DEUTERONOMY 29:2–29

#### *Section Overview: Covenant Responsibility*

The third address of Moses consists of two chapters that warn of the consequences of the curses and give assurance of restoration. A new narrative sequence begins in the third person, telling us how Moses assembles all of Israel. In the structure of Deuteronomy, the sermon begins with a recapitulation of the covenant that prepares for the acceptance of the oath in the following chapter.78 The first chapter of the third address is largely a recapitulation, including a review of the history of Israel with Yahweh (vv. 2–9), the oath of the covenant (vv. 10–15), and finally

<span id="page-271-8"></span>the warnings of disobedience (vv. 16–29). The warnings begin with the individual who might think that disregard of the covenant stipulations will not affect him. The consequence of such disobedience is the astonishment of the nations, as they contemplate what offense could have caused the God of the covenant to leave his people in such total ruin.

<span id="page-271-1"></span><span id="page-271-0"></span>As is typical of covenants, the suzerain making the covenant reminds the people he is summoning to be mindful of the great saving deeds he has exercised on their behalf. For Israel this is a recollection of the exodus, in which they were to learn the meaning of the name Yahweh, which they had not known previously (Ex. 6:3). The name Yahweh had been used since the days of Seth and Enosh (Gen. 4:26), but the person of Yahweh was not known as being with them in the manner of this covenant. Such knowledge would be gained through God's work among the nations, as God told Moses in explaining why Pharaoh would not let the people go (Ex. 7:3–5). Through God's dealings with Pharaoh and the other nations Israel would come to know Yahweh as the God present with and merciful to them. This chapter is a reminder of what Israel has learned.

God brought the people through "great trials" (Deut. 29:3), such as at Mount Sinai (Ex. 20:20). The test at Mount Sinai was followed by those in the wilderness (Deut. 8:2). These were lessons in learning to fear and love God, but they were also feats of God's accomplishment, signs and marvels, exploits of God over the nations and the fearsome wilderness. The problem was that Israel saw only miracles. Seeing only miracles, they came to demand miracles at every encounter of hardship, as occurred immediately at Rephidim, before they even arrived at Sinai (Ex. 17:1–7). Situations in which God overcame adversity for Israel became occasions on which they would test God. God brought Israel through the tests of deliverance at the Red Sea and the provision of manna when they had no ability to provide for food. Israel, failing to learn that they did not live by bread alone,

could not learn to love and fear God. Rather than fear God, they tested him at every turn. Israel needed a "heart to understand." The name Yahweh designated a God who was with them, not a God standing by to rescue them every time they faced a challenge. Instead of a heart to understand God, Israel was governed by its own insecurities. A heart to understand God is a gift from God for those willing to submit to God and trust him. It is not achieved merely because the proofs of God's sovereign work are immediately present.

The heart to understand God had not been given "to this day (Hb. *'ad hayyom hazzeh*). Israel now does have that heart, which is why Moses is prepared to lead them in renewal of the covenant. This is not to their credit; they are not wiser than the previous generation or somehow superior in perception. Yahweh has *brought* them to this place, to the humility to love and fear him. This had not been possible for the previous generation; judgment had come upon them, which determined that they would die in the wilderness.

<span id="page-272-2"></span><span id="page-272-1"></span><span id="page-272-0"></span>29:5–9 The wilderness wandering has had a specific purpose: "That you may know that I am the Lord your God" (Deut. 29:6). This is the very phrase that explains why Pharaoh does not let the people go (Ex. 7:5). God speaks in the first person, so the words conform precisely to those in Exodus. Israel has already begun to inherit the land. The lessons learned by this generation are the basis of hope, that they may "keep the words of this covenant" (Deut. 29:9). Recapitulation of the covenant words is intended to impress on those about to take the oath the importance of not taking the name in vain.

<span id="page-272-8"></span><span id="page-272-5"></span><span id="page-272-4"></span><span id="page-272-3"></span>29:10–15 Covenants were constituted through the taking of an oath, paraphrased as a "sworn covenant" (v. 12). In Hebrew this is the covenant (*berit*) and its curse (*'alah*). The curses of a covenant are punishment levied against the person who fails to observe its terms (e.g., 2 Chron. 34:24). A curse is a punishment carried out by God. This declaration of punishment involves the use of the divine name since the oath is declared before Yahweh. The use of the name in taking the oath of the covenant must not be insincere, and the name must not be taken in vain.

The participants in the oath are inclusive: the leaders and those doing the most menial of tasks; men, women, and children; those of Israel and all those living among them, both those present and those future. The result of the oath is a sworn relationship, not unlike that of a marriage, the most common picture of the relationship of God and Israel. Israel is to God a people; Yahweh is to Israel a God (Deut 29:13)—the standard definition of covenant found repeatedly in the Law and the Prophets. The commitments made in the taking of the oath are binding not only for those present but for all future generations.

<span id="page-272-7"></span><span id="page-272-6"></span>29:16–17 Passing through Moab and the experience of Baal-peor was a very recent reminder of the mortal danger of other religions and the futility of following gods that could be represented by wood and stone. Derogatory terms are used for these other gods; they are "detestable" (Hb. *shakketz*) and something that <span id="page-273-7"></span>is spurned. "Idols" (*gillulim*) is not a neutral designation.79 It is used to convey a sense of disgust and revulsion.

<span id="page-273-2"></span><span id="page-273-1"></span>29:18–21 The taking of an oath is a personal matter and is not a case of representation. This is expressed in the inclusion of both genders. Moses describes the man or woman who thinks he or she can participate in this covenant but still go his or her own way in the stubbornness and willful independence of his or her mind (v. 18). The reflexive translation of the Hebrew verb *barak* ("bless") as "blesses himself" cannot fully express the sense of the tense used. Grammarians describe this as an "estimative-declarative" use of the verb, a construction used to express what a person is thinking.80 This is a particularly appropriate way to express the violation of covenant. Such persons think they will be blessed even though they break the covenant. Instead of the curse (*'alah*), they presume prosperity (*shalom*). The assumption is that God will not notice one offender.

<span id="page-273-10"></span>Such a person is a root that grows poison and bitterness. Disobedience affects not only the individual sinner; sin is like yeast because it also affects all those around the one committing it. "Moist and dry" (v. 19) is a merism indicating totality. The analogy is ambiguous; it may be related to the metaphor of the cursed and blessed man in Jeremiah 17:5–8. The cursed man is a dried tamarisk in the desert, while the blessed man is a tree planted by streams of water. The terminology of this metaphor fits the covenant context. The merism, then, would refer to the destruction of the entire tribe or nation, those cursed and blessed. The disobedience of one person will not escape notice among everyone else in the tribe, as this person seems to think. The Lord will single that person out for punishment (Deut. 29:21). All the curses written here will come upon the disobedient person, but the end will be the sweeping away of all (v. 19), as the rest of the passage bears out. The disobedience of one is a root that bears poison that kills all.

<span id="page-273-8"></span><span id="page-273-5"></span><span id="page-273-4"></span><span id="page-273-3"></span>29:22–24 Sodom and Gomorrah are the prototypical example of divine judgment on a people; Isaiah uses the same metaphor for Jerusalem (Isa. 1:7–8). The result of God's judgment is infertility of soil, a land that cannot grow food or sustain a people, like the cities near the Dead Sea. Two groups of people will see the devastation God brings upon Israel, namely, a later generation and other nations. Both will ask the same question: what could so provoke the Lord that he would bring such utter destruction upon his people and his land?

<span id="page-273-9"></span>29:25–28 It seems that those who ask the question are the ones able to answer it, based on what Moses has written here. They worship gods outside their own

<span id="page-273-11"></span><span id="page-273-0"></span><sup>79</sup> The Hebrew word *gillulim* appears only in the OT or Jewish literature. It is used primarily by Ezekiel, several times in Deuteronomy and Kings, and once in Leviticus 26:30. It is apparently derived from the lexeme "to roll" and, as such, can refer to excrement. It is associated with defilement. Lexical discussion is provided by H. D. Press, "*gillûtîm*," *TDOT*, 3:1–5.

<span id="page-273-6"></span><sup>80</sup> For a discussion on this cf. Bruce Waltke and M. O'Conner, *An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax* (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1990), 26.2ff. With certain verbs this usage expresses a state intended or imagined without necessarily being true. An example is found in 2 Samuel 13:5, in which Jonadab tells Absalom to pretend to be sick.

experience, ones they do not know, gods never given to them for worship. They understand the curses written in this book and the reasons for exile.

<span id="page-274-0"></span>29:29 These words can be applied in more than one way, and each of them may be relevant. The way in which God brings his people to himself so that they will be in covenant relationship with him remains a mystery. The operation of divine grace cannot be explained. But the will of God is not a mystery. The words of the covenant are known; they are for mortals. People do have knowledge of the will of God.

These words may be applied to the history of the nation. Why was it that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC? Why was that the time at which God's mercy prevailed no longer? If mercy pertained in the days of Hezekiah and the attack of Sennacherib, why should the leaders of Jerusalem not believe such a deliverance would be repeated when the Babylonian armies surrounded Jerusalem? These ways of God remain a mystery. What is known is acted on by Hezekiah and Josiah. Both of these kings could lead the nation in covenant renewal, in a commitment to be loyal to God, but neither could determine the future of Jerusalem.

Targum Pseudo-Jonathan interprets this in a personal way. Concealed sins are known only to God, and he will punish them. Overt sins that violate the words of the covenant are the responsibility of those who take the covenant oath. The community must act accordingly.

The lesson of these words is relevant within the community and for the future of the people. God's work is hidden; the future is unknown. The present is known, and our task is to do the will of God immediately. But some things about the future *are* known, namely, that God will act according to his revealed will. Although no individual knows what this may mean in the future, it is enough to know what is right in the present.

#### *Response*

Another generation and other nations will see the desolation of the people of the covenant and their land, left as Sodom and Gomorrah, and ask, "Why this great rage?" The answer comes from Jeremiah and Ezekiel, two of the prophets of the exile. Both declared their messages unequivocally during the process of time that Jerusalem came under siege until it was destroyed. The ministry of Jeremiah began sometime after the death of Josiah in 609 BC, when the Egyptians set a ruler on the throne of Judah. Ezekiel was taken into captivity with the exiles of 598 BC. Both preach warnings of the judgment to come until the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Both testify to the intractable mindset of a people that could not recognize their doom during the twenty-year period in which it was already underway.

<span id="page-274-1"></span>The apostle Paul understands this mentality to have continued until his time. His burden is the question of the salvation of Israel in Romans 9–11.81 This is an inevitable question as the apostle provides an exposition of salvation from

<span id="page-275-4"></span><span id="page-275-0"></span>the Scriptures in his letter to the Romans. "Has God rejected his people? By no means!" (Rom. 11:1). Proof of this is the apostle himself, an Israelite from the tribe of Benjamin. Jews of Paul's time knew their lineage; they were not lost genealogically no matter their tribe. Jews such as Paul might be as few as the remnant in Elijah's day during the terror of Jezebel, but they were not eliminated. In Romans 11:8 the apostle refers to Deuteronomy 29:4, in which Moses says God has not given the Israelites a heart to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear "to this day." Humans do not come to know God through what they see or hear. Faith is a gift of mercy. Israel is proof of that truth. Paul, however, expresses the reality of Israel in a manner that is direct and harsh. God has given them a "spirit of deep sleep," a phrase found in Isaiah 29:10. The present state of Israel is part of the plan of God no less than the creation of Israel was God's divine plan of redemption.

<span id="page-275-6"></span><span id="page-275-5"></span><span id="page-275-3"></span><span id="page-275-2"></span>This explains why Paul is in such a minority. This rejection of the saving mercy of God continues "to this day." This day is as true in the time of Paul as it was at any other time Deuteronomy was read. But the punishment of the exile was not the end of the hardness of Israel; the time of mercy will come to Israel as well. According to Isaiah 59:20 a redeemer will come from Israel who will remove the transgression of Jacob and restore the covenant (cf. Rom. 11:26–27). The mercy of God is irrevocable. "All Israel" (Rom. 11:16) will be saved. Paul views the salvation of Israel as a future eschatological event that fulfills the promises to the fathers.

#### *Section Overview: The Way of Life and Death*

<span id="page-276-11"></span><span id="page-276-8"></span><span id="page-276-4"></span><span id="page-276-3"></span>Chapters 29–30 are marked as a unit by the introduction of 29:2, in which Moses assembles the people, and the introduction in 31:1, in which the narrator says that Moses spoke "these words to all Israel." The summary character of the call to choose life in 30:15–20 forms a conclusion to the purpose of Moses in assembling the people in 29:2. The anticipation of the covenant in 29:10–15 is concluded by the call to accept the covenant in 30:15–20. This chapter is a renewed call to love the Lord your God (30:6, 16, 20). This call is an obvious echo of the chief imperative of the main section of this Torah, which summarized the covenant requirement with a call to love at the beginning (6:5) and the conclusion of the exhortation (11:1). The people's need is a circumcised heart (10:16; 30:6). The external sign of the covenant has no significance apart from an internal commitment to obedience.

<span id="page-276-6"></span><span id="page-276-5"></span><span id="page-276-2"></span><span id="page-276-1"></span>The dire situation of exile is reversed by God's restoring and renewing his people (30:1–10). Experience of the curse is not the end of the covenant. Although the people find themselves in exile, restoration is possible. This hope was held out by Moses in concluding his first sermon in 4:29–31. Those words are substantially repeated here, binding together the book.

<span id="page-276-7"></span><span id="page-276-0"></span>The requirement of restoration is unchanged: it is the necessity of love for God. The responsibilities of love are not far removed or hard to understand (30:11–14). <span id="page-277-10"></span>When the words of the Torah are in the people's mind, it is possible for them to carry out the duty of love. The choice, however, is stark: life or death (vv. 15–20). There is no such thing as a partial love for God. If Israel understands and fears God, they will have life. If they serve any other god, they do not understand God at all. Knowing Yahweh excludes the possibility of other gods. The result of seeking such gods is death. Moses concludes his sermon with the only logical option: choose life.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-277-3"></span><span id="page-277-1"></span>30:1–10 The passage begins with a long conditional sentence comprising the first three verses. The first two verses state the condition: in the future, Israel will have experienced the blessing and the curse. The thought returns to the covenant at Moab as given in chapter 28. Once Israel has experienced the curse of exile, she will turn to God as she lives among all the nations, regardless of where she has been scattered. This brings about the apodosis: then God will restore Israel's fortunes, show mercy, and gather her back to her land. The protasis and apodosis play on the Hebrew word *shub*, which simply means to turn. When in exile Israel will turn to God (30:2). Once it has met this condition, God will then "restore [its] fortunes" (*shab weshebut*), literally "turn their turnings" (v. 3). The condition of the protasis is a repetition of words found in the key summary of the covenant found in 6:5: the people turn to the Lord with all their mind and all their desire. The possibility of mercy is not past, even though they are in exile.

<span id="page-277-7"></span><span id="page-277-6"></span><span id="page-277-5"></span><span id="page-277-4"></span><span id="page-277-2"></span><span id="page-277-0"></span>The passage is structured around the central requirement of a circumcised heart (30:6). The blessing is expressed in variations of the Hebrew word for good (*tob*). If Israel in exile turns to the Lord with all its heart (vv. 1, 2), God will show mercy and make the people prosperous (*hetibeka*) so that they become more numerous than their fathers (v. 5). When they love God with a circumcised heart (v. 6), God will make their land fertile for prosperity (*letobah*), and the Lord will "take delight" in making them prosperous (*letob*), with a delight like he had for their fathers (v. 9). The requirement is that Israel must hear the voice of the Lord according to everything written in this book of the Torah (v. 10). The effect of this structure is to make the circumcised mind the central point of emphasis:

- <span id="page-277-9"></span><span id="page-277-8"></span>(A) "Obey his voice in all that I command you." (v. 2)
	- (B) "He will make you more prosperous and numerous." (v. 5)
		- (C) "The Lord your God will circumcise your heart." (v. 6)
- (B') "The Lord your God will circumcise your heart. . . . The Lord will again take delight in prospering you." (v. 9)
- (A') "Obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep his commandments." (v. 10)

<span id="page-278-2"></span><span id="page-278-1"></span><span id="page-278-0"></span>In 10:16 God exhorted Israel to circumcise their hearts. In this passage God promises to circumcise their minds once they have turned to him. Unlike the Greek language, Hebrew does not have a word that means "mind." The two words commonly used for mind are *leb* ("heart") and *ruakh* (spirit). In Deuteronomy the emphasis of keeping the covenant is on the mind (6:5). Israel must remember how God tested them to know their mind (8:2), and they must know with their mind that God has instructed them as a father teaches a child. Remembering, learning, and knowing are all functions of the mind (*leb*). The Ten Words end on the activity of the mind, the command not to covet. In the new covenant the Torah will be written on the mind (Jer. 31:33), and there will no longer be any need to teach the other to know the Lord, because they will all know him.

<span id="page-278-13"></span><span id="page-278-10"></span><span id="page-278-9"></span><span id="page-278-8"></span><span id="page-278-7"></span><span id="page-278-3"></span>30:11–14 The will of God is not unintelligible or inaccessible. His teaching has been given to Israel, and they know everything necessary to have life. Knowledge for Israel is not access to the mysteries of the universe. Job 28, the powerful poem on wisdom, twice asks the question of where wisdom may be found (Job 28:12, 20). The answer is that only God knows the way to the mysteries of the universe. His instructions for mortals are to fear God and turn from evil (Job 28:28). Life is not to be found in trying to probe the mysteries of life's origins. The psalmist confesses freely concerning the subject of embryogeny (the beginnings of animate existence): "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain it" (Ps. 139:6). Job, who sought to know the mysteries of the universe, is forced to concede, "Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful [*niphla'ot*] for me, which I did not know" (Job 42:3). In contrast, Moses declares that God's teaching is not too wonderful (*niphle't*; "hard") for them; it is not far off. Knowledge of God's will is "in your mouth," an idiom that means it can be recited by memory (cf. Deut. 31:19). The will of God is well understood and can be obeyed.

<span id="page-278-12"></span><span id="page-278-11"></span><span id="page-278-6"></span><span id="page-278-4"></span>30:15–20 To set life and death before Israel is more than an invitation to accept the covenant. It is a reminder that rejection of the covenant has a certain consequence. Israel took the oath at Mount Sinai and will take it again in the Promised Land at Shechem. The covenant given at Moab is the content of that oath that will be written on the stones at Shechem when Israel renews its commitment to God.

<span id="page-278-5"></span>Witnesses are a part of every covenant. God calls such witnesses to give testimony to the oath that Israel is taking (v. 19). In ancient covenants the witnesses were gods that carried out the curses. The heavens do withhold the rain and the earth does become like stone, but in Deuteronomy they are not independent <span id="page-279-6"></span>agents. The heavens and earth are the material or common representation of the presence of God that will forever give testimony to the words spoken. The prophet Isaiah will use this testimony to reveal the way in which the leaders of Jerusalem have utterly violated the word and will of God (Isa. 1:2). It is part of a literary form in which the truth of the covenant can be brought to bear on a specific situation.

<span id="page-279-5"></span><span id="page-279-4"></span><span id="page-279-3"></span>The call to life begins and ends with the imperative of love (Deut. 30:15–16, 19–20), which is to walk in all God's ways and to hear his voice and cling to him. Knowledge essential to all mortals is that "he is your life" (v. 20). If this knowledge is forfeited, no other knowledge will matter.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-279-7"></span>One of the enigmas of the fulfillment of salvation is the defiance of the Jews in response to the teaching of Jesus and the proclamation of the gospel. Gentiles not familiar with the promises to Israel or the covenant with God respond in great numbers. The evangelism at Antioch is so successful that it raises the attention of the church at Jerusalem. They send Barnabas to investigate (Acts 11:20–26). Seeing the size of the response, Barnabas seeks out Saul from Tarsus, who gathers the believers in such numbers that they soon become distinguished as a movement and identified as Christians. They are no longer just another sect of the Jews. On the other hand, Jews across the Roman Empire resist and hate these people. In his letter to the Romans Paul turns to the third speech of Moses in the book of Deuteronomy in order to address this dilemma. Paul feels so strongly about the rejection of his people that he would consider himself anathema on their behalf (Rom. 9:1–3). This is not possible, but the message of Moses convinces Paul that redemption for his people will be found in Christ.

<span id="page-279-13"></span><span id="page-279-12"></span><span id="page-279-11"></span><span id="page-279-10"></span><span id="page-279-9"></span><span id="page-279-8"></span><span id="page-279-2"></span><span id="page-279-1"></span><span id="page-279-0"></span>Paul assesses the situation of the Jewish people in Romans 9:30–10:21. His answer comes in two parts. Paul discusses the nature of the gospel (Rom. 9:32–10:13) then God's relationship to Israel through the gospel (Rom. 10:14– 21). Israel has stumbled at the stone of scandal in pursuing a righteousness of works. They do not understand that Christ is the goal of the Torah (10:4). Paul discusses covenant renewal for Israel in 10:6–11. He reads Deuteronomy 30 as an announcement of covenant renewal following the judgment and exile described in Deuteronomy 29. The exile of Deuteronomy had continued until the time of the Messiah. With Jesus renewal becomes possible. The means of covenant renewal is found in Deuteronomy 30:11–14. Paul applies what is said of the Torah to the Messiah. He has come down, so when the word about him is accepted by faith, the work of the new covenant has taken place. Deuteronomy thus offers a fresh vision for the fulfillment of the covenant. Paul sees this vision as performed by Christ and fulfilled in the Christian by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:5–8). Confessing faith in Christ is the surprising and paradoxical fulfilling of the Torah taught by Moses (Rom. 10:5). Righteousness is reckoned by faith in Christ; it is not by faith in fulfilling the law, as taught at Qumran, a view found in a document called 4QMMT (Miqṣat Maʻaśê ha-Torah).82 Faith in Christ is the sign of covenant membership.

<span id="page-280-2"></span><span id="page-280-1"></span>The stumbling of Israel is not outside of divine providence (Rom. 10:14–21). God's method is to provoke Israel to jealousy through a nation that does not understand (Rom. 9:19; cf. Deut. 32:21). The gospel has been offensive to Israel, while Gentiles believe in order to make Israel jealous so that God may reach out to the people he foreknew.

31 So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel. **2**And he said to them, "I am 120 years old today. I am no longer able to go out and come in. The Lord has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.' **3**The Lord your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, so that you shall dispossess them, and Joshua will go over at your head, as the Lord has spoken. **4**And the Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them. **5**And the Lord will give them over to you, and you shall do to them according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you. **6**Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you."

**<sup>7</sup>**Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land that the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall put them in possession of it. **<sup>8</sup>** It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed."

**<sup>9</sup>**Then Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. **10**And Moses commanded them, "At the end of every seven years, at the set time in the year of release, at the Feast of Booths, **11**when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. **12**Assemble the people, men, women, and little ones, and the sojourner within your towns, that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, and be careful to do all the words of this law, **<sup>13</sup>** and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as you live in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess."

**<sup>14</sup>**And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, the days approach when you must die. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." And Moses and Joshua went and presented

themselves in the tent of meeting. **15**And the Lord appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud. And the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the tent.

**<sup>16</sup>**And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise and whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering, and they will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them. **17**Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide my face from them, and they will be devoured. And many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, 'Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?' **18**And I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil that they have done, because they have turned to other gods.

**<sup>19</sup>** "Now therefore write this song and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel. **20**For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten and are full and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, and despise me and break my covenant. **21**And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give." **<sup>22</sup>** So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel.

**<sup>23</sup>**And the Lord*<sup>1</sup>* commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to give them. I will be with you."

**<sup>24</sup>**When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book to the very end, **25**Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, **<sup>26</sup>** "Take this Book of the Law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against you. **27**For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are.

And in the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger through the work of your hands."

**<sup>30</sup>**Then Moses spoke the words of this song until they were finished, in the ears of all the assembly of Israel:

#### *Section Overview: Provisions for Covenant Continuity*

The epilogue shifts from reported speech to narrative action that includes instructions and poems. Covenant making and law giving give way to provisions for the future. The words spoken by Moses have been given. The narrator turns to reporting the events that conclude not only Deuteronomy but the entire Torah. They describe the steps taken by Moses to prepare Israel for the future in his absence. The death of Moses and the provision to transfer leadership to Joshua set the scene (vv. 1–8). The appointment of Joshua as successor, the deposition of the written Torah, and the memorization of the song are the repeated topics.

<span id="page-282-1"></span>Chapter 31 does not relate the closing events in sequence. The rabbis referred to this phenomenon as "nothing early and nothing late," their way of expressing the observation that material in the Torah is given topically. Continuity of the covenant is the burden of the epilogue. Israel is told repeatedly that future generations will not be obedient (e.g., vv. 16, 20, 27). This truth makes the reading of the Torah and the memorization of the song under the new leadership of Joshua an urgent concern.

<span id="page-282-8"></span><span id="page-282-7"></span><span id="page-282-6"></span><span id="page-282-5"></span><span id="page-282-3"></span>The actions of Moses could not have taken place in the sequence reported in the narration. Moses speaks to Israel about his death and then to Joshua before all Israel to designate him as successor (vv. 1–8). Joshua and Moses are stationed at the entrance to the tabernacle (vv. 14–15). Moses is given instructions to write the song and teach it to the people (vv. 16–22). After the song is taught to the assembly, Yahweh appoints Joshua as successor to Moses at the tabernacle, saying, "I will be with you" (v. 23). The divine anointing of Joshua is interrupted with the teaching of the song. The deposition of the Torah is repeated in two separate sections. The arrangement makes the giving of the written Torah and the teaching of the song the emphasis of the chapter. The chapter is arranged as a chiasm to place the giving of the Torah at the beginning and the end, with the teaching of the song in the very center:

- <span id="page-282-4"></span>(A) Moses writes the Torah and gives it to the priests. (vv. 9–13)
	- (B) Joshua and Moses are stationed at the entrance to the tabernacle. (vv. 14–15)
		- (C) Moses writes the song and teaches it to all the people. (vv. 16–22)
	- (B') Yahweh commissions Joshua at the tabernacle. (v. 23)
- <span id="page-282-9"></span>(A') Moses gives the written Torah to the Levites who place it in the ark. (vv. 24–26)

This technique inextricably binds together the song with the reading of the Torah, which is the intent of the epilogue.

<span id="page-282-10"></span><span id="page-282-2"></span><span id="page-282-0"></span>The narration of the epilogue continues with Moses' issuing a directive to assemble all the leaders of Israel so that they may learn the words of the song. It will be their responsibility to teach it. The reporting of the speech of Moses begun at 31:1 is concluded in 32:44–47 after the giving of the words of the song. The song is introduced with calling the heavens and earth to act as witness (31:28–30), just as they did in the taking of the vow (30:19). In the main Masoretic Text (Leningrad Codex and Aleppo Codex) the introduction to the song is purposefully distinguished by separating each word with dots (31:28–30). The song itself is set in parallel lines. The epilogue is constructed so that both the written Torah and the Song of Moses act as an eternal witness to God's relationship with his people.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-283-4"></span><span id="page-283-3"></span>31:1–6 "Moses continued to speak" to all Israel is a paraphrase of either "Moses went [*wylk*] and spoke" (MT) to all Israel or "Moses finished speaking [*wykl*]" (1QDeutb II, 4 [Dead Sea Scrolls])83 to all Israel. The difference is a common scribal error called metathesis, the interchange of the last two letters of the word. It is impossible to tell which direction the error occurred, but the reading of the Qumran manuscript and the Greek is more natural as a transition. The narrator is saying that the words of Moses as reported beginning at 29:2 are now complete. The same phrase is used at the end of the song in 32:45: "Moses had finished speaking" to all Israel. All the words of Moses have been faithfully reported. The narrator now brings the book to a conclusion, reporting the last words and actions of Moses in biographical style. The first key topic immediately taken up is the designation of Joshua as the successor to Moses. The whole section will end with the account of the death of Moses on Mount Nebo.

<span id="page-283-5"></span><span id="page-283-2"></span><span id="page-283-1"></span><span id="page-283-0"></span>Moses was eighty years old at the time of the exodus (Ex. 7:7), and since that time forty years have transpired in the desert (Deut. 1:3). In biblical representation, three generations would be one hundred twenty years, a concept reflected already in Genesis 6:3 at the time of the flood. There are individuals who live one hundred twenty years, but this may not be the import of the statement concerning the age of Moses. Moses is telling the people that he has lived through three generations: the times of slavery in Egypt, of exile in Midian, and of wandering in the desert. This is now a change of era for Israel.

The first point of importance is to remember that the battle belongs to the Lord, the one going before them. This is the only basis for the exhortation to "be strong

<span id="page-284-12"></span>and courageous," words that will be given to Joshua and that Joshua in turn will give to the people (Josh. 1:6–9). Yahweh has shown repeatedly that he does not fail.

<span id="page-284-2"></span><span id="page-284-1"></span>31:7–8 The formal commissioning of Joshua is described in Numbers 27:18–23. There Moses lays hands on Joshua in the presence of Eleazar the priest and all Israel, imparting to him the divine authority and power he himself had received. This event is described as taking place in Deuteronomy 34:9. In these verses Joshua is designated as the one who will lead the people to inherit the land.

<span id="page-284-11"></span><span id="page-284-3"></span>31:9–13 These verses are descriptive of the earliest formation of Scripture. The words are written down, as in other cultures, and deposited in the care of the religious and civil leaders. They in turn are responsible to make these words known to the people. One of the means to do so is aural; every seven years at the fall festival the Torah is to be read to the entire assembly that has gathered at the central place. This event exhibits a democratic emphasis—it must include women, children, and all those who live within the territory of Israel. The Torah affects the entire community, since its requirements are relevant to every person.

<span id="page-284-5"></span><span id="page-284-4"></span>31:14–15 The tent of meeting is the covered portion of the tabernacle; it is given this name because it is the place that represents the presence of God as he meets with the people. Verse 15 seems somewhat inconsistent, suggesting that God appears inside the tent rather than at the door, the usual place he is seen. The Greek version is clear: the cloud remains at the door of the meeting place. It may be that the preposition in verse 15a should not be pressed. The cloud encompasses the tent as it did when glory descended upon it at its completion (Ex. 40:34). Joshua and Moses remain at the entrance.

<span id="page-284-8"></span><span id="page-284-7"></span><span id="page-284-6"></span><span id="page-284-0"></span>31:16–22 Israel will be disobedient and will suffer the many evils of the curses of the covenant. It is not clear whether the people will recognize that this is because they have abandoned the Lord God or because the gods they have served are not with them (Deut. 31:17). The Hebrew term *'elohim* ("God" or gods) is not qualified, suggesting a double error. They have followed false gods and do not understand that their problem is that not only the gods they followed but also Yahweh has hidden his face from them.

<span id="page-284-9"></span>Moses is to put this song "in their mouths" (v. 19), and Israel must learn the song by memory. They must be able to recite it. These words will stand as an eternal testimony so that the people will always know that their trials are entirely just on the part of their merciful God. It is a sad irony that divine provision of plenty becomes the very reason God is abandoned. This is no surprise to God, who already knows their thinking. This song, always in the minds of the people and their descendants, will confront them with the reality of the results of serving other gods.

<span id="page-284-10"></span>31:23 God appoints Joshua as leader. This is the completion of the action begun in verses 14–15. It is the first time God speaks directly to Joshua.

<span id="page-285-4"></span>31:24–27 The Levites are responsible to preserve the document. Ancient documents were typically kept in the sacred shrine of the sanctuary. It is an eternal testimony to the fact that Israel has accepted the terms and conditions of the covenant. Moses knows well the behavior of the Israelites; they have not been able to keep the terms of their oath while he has been alive, and will be even less able to do so after his death.

<span id="page-285-6"></span><span id="page-285-5"></span>31:28–30 The transition to the poem is logical, as it will also be a testimony ever present in their memory. The heavens and the earth are divine agents, in both giving testimony to the oath and carrying out its curses. "In the days to come" (v. 29) is "the latter days," but this does not have the significance of the last days as in the Prophets (e.g., Isa. 2:2). Here it simply means times like those of the judges, when Israel constantly turns away from God.

#### <span id="page-285-8"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-285-3"></span><span id="page-285-0"></span>The epilogue returns to the themes of the historical prologue that introduce the book (cf. Introduction: Genre and Literary Features). The time is after Sihon and Og have been defeated in Transjordan (Deut. 31:4). Moses will not cross the Jordan (31:2; cf. 3:23–26), but Joshua will be his successor (31:3; cf. 3:28). Moses will die in Mount Nebo, the high point of the Pisgah range (32:49–50), as stated in the prologue (3:27). The epilogue brings closure to covenant renewal, the vital component to choosing life.

<span id="page-285-7"></span><span id="page-285-2"></span><span id="page-285-1"></span>The warnings of the epilogue make crystal clear that there are only two options in life. Humans created to represent God may abandon him, but God will never abandon them. Abandonment of God does not provide an escape from him. The intention of just one individual to ignore the requirements of the divine relationship will not escape divine notice (29:18–20). The curse of covenant violation will be lurking for that individual; there will be no escape. Failure to observe the requirements of a relationship with God will occur. This is different from turning away to follow other gods, mostly represented in the wood, stone, and molded metal of earthly pursuits.

Faithfulness is impossible apart from discipline, especially discipline of the mind. The instruction of God demands regular repetition. Focus of the mind requires words that are known and can be repeated. A technological age leads to a tendency to minimize memorization and to assume that things can be looked up rather than learned. But technology cannot be exchanged for the spiritual work Moses demands in this epilogue. Learning and retaining instruction is never finished. It takes the presence of spontaneous words to have clear vision, the hearing of the covenant responsibilities, and the words of instructive song.

#### *Section Overview: Song of Moses*

Songs are among the most important means of communicating and retaining theology, especially in a time when access to writing is limited to a small number of people. As is typical of Hebrew poetry, this song is characterized by parallel lines (rhythmic units) that complement each other. Unlike narrative, poems are not structured by sentences in grammatical sequence. Thoughts are incorporated within lines or in combinations of lines. In the oldest Masoretic manuscripts, lines of this song are separated. There is repetition but not redundancy. Verse 24 may be taken as an example, given a somewhat over-literal equivalent:

<span id="page-289-0"></span>Ravaging famine Consuming plague Raging pestilence Fangs of beasts I will send against them With venomous creepers in dust. (AT)

The staccato lines create the effect of sensing the sequence of sudden disasters that come without warning. The subject and verb of the sentence are left to the penultimate line, where they have a higher impact. All this occurs because God is with them. He is the one advancing these disasters, because he has given them a covenant. This Israel agreed to when they took the oath.

As most poems, the song has unusual vocabulary and succinct memorable expressions. In the lines quoted above, the words for "plague" (Hb. *reshef*) and raging (*qeteb*; "pestilence") are the names of spirit gods (demons) here used metaphorically, the first along the lines of storm or destruction and the second of burning or flashes of lightning. In some ways it is impossible to translate metaphors; even if an equivalent referent can be given, the sense that goes with the expression is lost. The reader must be aware of the limitations to translating any poem from another culture or language. The power of the poem would have a greater impact on an Israelite in the circumstance of Moab than can be rendered in translation.

<span id="page-290-6"></span><span id="page-290-5"></span><span id="page-290-4"></span><span id="page-290-2"></span>The poem is a eulogy to the redeemer of Israel. He is their Rock, not in the sense of being a refuge but in his constant and unmovable care and presence. Heaven and earth are called on to be witnesses to the divine Word (32:1). The Rock is introduced as faithful but is betrayed by the children he has begotten, who are non-children (vv. 2–6). Creation imagery comes to mind as God finds Israel in the howling wilderness and hovers over them as an eagle guarding its young (vv. 10–11). God's loving care for Israel is rewarded with rebellion; they kick back like an overfed animal (vv. 15–18). God in turn will light a fire that burns to the depths of death (vv. 19–25). He does not utterly consume Israel, because the nations would misunderstand (vv. 26–31). The pride of the nations is avenged by God, who alone has such a prerogative (v. 35). The Lord takes an oath by himself that he will sharpen his sword and bring about vindication (vv. 40–41). The song ends with a coda of praise (v. 43). In reciting this song Israel will understand its place among the nations.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-290-12"></span><span id="page-290-3"></span><span id="page-290-1"></span><span id="page-290-0"></span>32:1–6 The first three verses are a prologue or exordium, given in the first person to a universal audience. They are similar to Psalm 49:1–4, which appeals to all people everywhere to hear the psalmist's testimony of coming to understand the ways of God. The Song of Moses is a covenant setting that begins with the motif of the heavens and earth as bearing witness (cf. Deut. 30:19; 31:28). These words are like life-giving water. The song is a doxology (v. 3), giving praise to the wonderful works of Yahweh. His deeds are flawless, and he is always faithful. This is a contrast to Israel, who is corrupt, perverse, and foolish.

<span id="page-291-8"></span><span id="page-291-7"></span><span id="page-291-6"></span><span id="page-291-4"></span>Verse 5 is challenging in structure, but when understood correctly it is a commanding poetic line. The key term is *non-children* ("no longer his children"), which has its parallel to *non-gods* in verse 17, *non-faithfulness* in verse 20, and *non-gods* and *non-people* in verse 21. These non-children are the subject of the verb "dealt corruptly." The line is succinct and compelling: "His non-sons, their blemish, have behaved corruptly toward him" (AT). Those God has created to be his children have disowned their pedigree.

<span id="page-291-5"></span><span id="page-291-0"></span>The rhetorical questions of verse 6 establish the key theological premise of the poem. The Rock is the Father and creator of Israel. The metaphor of fatherhood conveys the concept of procreation, as does the verb "create" (Hb. *qanah*). This word is used in Genesis 4:1 as the name of the firstborn son of Adam and Eve. As she says, "I have gotten [*qaniti* ] a man with the help of the Lord," so she named him *qayin*  ("Cain"). Every child is a creation of God. Israel was created, made, and secured by God. This is what it meant for him to choose Israel, as Isaiah says repeatedly (Isa. 43:1; 44:1–2). Israel is not distinguished from other nations in being more special than they in her own right. Rather, her relationship to God is much more fundamental. Her very existence is by divine choice. It is a bitter irony that Israel could be so foolish as to repay their progenitor and sole provider with perverse rebellion.

<span id="page-291-13"></span><span id="page-291-9"></span><span id="page-291-1"></span>32:7–14 These verses develop the theological premise that Israel holds a distinct role among the nations. It begins with an imperative to remember Israel's origins. God assigned the territorial, familial, and national divisions of the entire human race, as explained in Genesis 10. The peoples listed number precisely seventy, representing all nations on earth. Genesis does not provide the enumeration, but the symbolism is clear. Seventy signifies the total of human families, all under the dominion of Yahweh. This number corresponds to the number of the "sons of Israel" (Deut. 32:8 MT; cf. ESV mg.). The sons of Jacob are counted as seventy when each of the names is counted (Gen. 46:27; Ex. 1:5; Deut. 10:22). God made the seventy sons of Israel his own possession. Israel has become the special assignment of Yahweh among the seventy nations. This is the fundamental premise of the poem.

<span id="page-291-15"></span><span id="page-291-14"></span><span id="page-291-12"></span><span id="page-291-11"></span><span id="page-291-10"></span><span id="page-291-3"></span><span id="page-291-2"></span>This distinction of numbers raises exegetical questions that cannot be glossed over. Stephen says the number of the sons of Jacob is seventy-five (Acts 7:14), a number that he derives from the enumeration of individuals found in Genesis 46 in the LXX. This is a calculation determined by the placement of the five sons of Joseph. They can be considered as born in Egypt or can be included in the total of those who went down to Egypt. The Hebrew traditions have it both ways, but the number seventy-five does not conform to the seventy sons of Israel in verse 8. Other Hebrew texts do not include Israel in this verse. They say that God set the boundaries of the nations according to the sons of Elohim (cf. 4QDeutj [Dead Sea Scrolls] and most of the Greek tradition), meaning the number of members in the divine council. "Sons of God [*elohim*]" corresponds to the phrase used in Job 1:6, where the divine council gathers before God. Daniel 10:13 assigns heavenly princes to different nations. God has a court, as expressed in various psalms (Pss. 29:1;

<span id="page-292-7"></span>82:1; 89:7). The various members of his court are given assigned territories. The distinction of Israel is that God has made its territory his own allotted space. It is not assigned to court members like the other nations.

<span id="page-292-0"></span>The textual change of "sons of God" to "sons of Israel" in verse 8 is described by the rabbis as a *tiqqun soferim* ("change of the scribes"). There is a great deal of discussion over when the change was made to verse 8 and the possible reasons for it.84 This change requires the number of the sons of Israel be counted as seventy and not as seventy-five, in Acts 7:14. The theological statement is clear: Israel is the allotted territory God chose for himself when he divided the nations.

<span id="page-292-9"></span><span id="page-292-8"></span><span id="page-292-2"></span><span id="page-292-1"></span>The image of God as a father caring for his children is developed by a description of Israel in the howling desert waste of Sinai, where he embraced her and fixed his attention on her as the apple of his eye. He guarded her as an eagle takes care of its nest. The Hebrew word *'ir* (Deut. 32:11) is found in Ugaritic with the meaning of "guard" or "protect," which is the meaning that fits the poetic lines. This was a time when Israel was uncorrupted by other gods (v. 12), a confession to which Isaiah will call Israel to bear witness after the exile (Isa. 43:12). Virgin Israel was triumphant, riding the high hills, living from the produce of the field and drawing honey from the mountains. She enjoyed the richest of food from cattle and sheep, the fattest animals from the abundant hills of Bashan, thick kernels of wheat from the hills, and the juiciest grapes that provided wine. The father spared nothing in caring for his daughter.

<span id="page-292-3"></span>32:15–18 The use of the name "Jeshurun" in the context of Israel's rebellion is a potent poetic irony. The name carries the connotation of one that is upright (Hb. *yashar*), but the effect of all of God's bounteous provision for Israel was like that of a fatted unruly animal that kicks against the person who cares for it. Israel replaced its maker with non-gods, referred to here as demons (*shedim*), which correspond to the protective spirits and household gods known in Akkadian as *shedu*. 85 Instead of trusting the God they knew from experience as their Maker, they offended him with newly discovered non-deities. They forgot the Rock who had given birth to them, the one who had nursed them with honey from a stone.

<span id="page-292-6"></span><span id="page-292-4"></span>32:19–25 The worship of non-gods vexes the Rock, who justly acts in accordance with the covenant. He turns away from the non-faithful and provokes them with those who are a non-nation, probably a reference to nomadic peoples such as the "Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East" (Judg. 6:2–6). The anger of God is described as a hot flame that burns to the roots of the mountains or sharp arrows that pierce to their core. Divine punishment comes in a succession of disasters of diverse kinds (cf. Section Overview, esp. discussion of Deut. 32:24).

<span id="page-292-5"></span><sup>84</sup> Cf. D. Barthélemy, "Les Tiqquné Sopherim et la critique textuelle de L'Ancien Testament," in *Congress Volume, Bonn 1962*, ed. John Emerton, VTSup 9 (Leiden: Brill, 1963), 285–304. Barthélemy identifies this verse as a *tiqqun soferim* ("change of the scribes"). A further study on the time of this change was done by Innocent Himbaza, "Dt. 32:8, une correction tardive des scribes: Essai d'interprétation et de datation," *Bib* 83/4 (2002): 527–548.

<span id="page-293-1"></span>The metaphors of verse 24 use analogies characterized by local deities. The creeping vermin "in the dust" could be poisonous snakes, insects, or scorpions. Sword without and dread within will terrorize everyone—the best of men and maids, nursing children and the elderly.

<span id="page-293-4"></span><span id="page-293-2"></span>32:26–31 The song transitions with a conditional statement stating the reason God did not fully destroy the nation he had made. He would have removed Israel from human memory had it not been for the attitude of the nations. The enemies of Israel misjudge the situation; they think their dominance is because of their own power. The nations do not recognize the judgment of the Lord against Israel because they are utterly devoid of understanding. Verse 29 introduces a second unreal condition. If the nations had any understanding, they would perceive the circumstances of their victory. Their "latter end" (Hb. *'aharit*) here carries the sense of understanding why things have come about, the reasons for their situation. How was it possible for one soldier of Israel to rout a thousand of the enemy? The enemy has never considered this. Israel could be defeated only by its own betrayal of its Lord. The enemy should have discerned the work of the Rock, who had sold them to their enemies. The enemy should have recognized that the Rock of Israel is not as their rock, that is, their own god. The gods of the enemy could never have won such victories as they have witnessed for Israel.

<span id="page-293-6"></span><span id="page-293-3"></span><span id="page-293-0"></span>The rendering of 31b, "Our enemies are by themselves," renders an obscure poetic line. The difficulty is with the Hebrew word *pelilim*, which means either "judges" or "judgments." It occurs in Exodus 21:22, where judges must decide the damages to be paid in the case of an injury. The enemy has made the wrong assessment in thinking its god (rock) has been victorious. If the nation of Deuteronomy 32:28 is taken to be Israel, then the reasoning of verses 29–31 applies to Israel as the misguided nation, and the judgment ( *pelilim*) would be the reasoning of Israel concerning its enemies. This is the meaning of the ESV: Israel assesses its enemies to have no god ("our enemies are by themselves"; v. 31). Though the nation of verse 28 is ambiguous, the sequence could suggest it is the enemy that falsely considered itself triumphant.

<span id="page-293-7"></span><span id="page-293-5"></span>32:32–35 The poem now turns to judgment upon the nations; God will judge the enemy as he has judged such arrogant attitudes in the past. The enemy will suffer the same fate as did Sodom and Gomorrah. They will drink the wine served from the same vines as those condemned cities. Clusters of grapes will be poisonous, and their wine will be like the venom of a snake. The mercy of God cannot be presumed. For the arrogant, who claim their own independent strength, poisonous wine is sealed up and stored away. One of the most common artifacts found in Judean fortified cities is pot handles stamped with the Hebrew *lmlk* ("to the king"), with the name of the king often included as well. These are fragments of wine and oil jars sealed and stored by the king in fortified cities to serve as reserves in either commerce or preparation for war. The Song of Moses uses this as the image for God's storehouse when he goes to war.

<span id="page-294-17"></span><span id="page-294-12"></span><span id="page-294-2"></span>Vengeance belongs to God alone (v. 35). This important concept is quoted by Paul (Rom. 12:19) and the writer to the Hebrews (Heb. 10:30) in their exhortations to Christians concerning the conduct they must exhibit when wronged. The same principle was true in the covenant of Deuteronomy for personal conduct (cf. Prov. 25:21–22). In the Song of Moses this phrase is applied to the enemies of Israel. Jesus applies this verse to speak of the future desolation of Jerusalem in AD 70 (Luke 21:22), a direct application of the concept in Deuteronomy.

<span id="page-294-16"></span><span id="page-294-11"></span><span id="page-294-9"></span><span id="page-294-4"></span><span id="page-294-3"></span><span id="page-294-0"></span>32:36–42 Israel will be reduced to utter weakness; she will no longer have any leaders (Deut. 32:36). The expression "bond or free" (Hb. *'atsur we'azub*) is usually taken as a merism to mean everyone, but it has the more technical meaning of "redeemer-savior", referring to a king or leader. The construction is a hendiadys, in which two nouns or adjectives are joined to complement each other (e.g., "nice and warm"). The word *'atsur* means "ruler" or "restrainer" (e.g., 1 Sam. 9:17; "restrain"), while *'azub* is a word meaning "helper" or "deliverer" (e.g., Ex. 23:5; "rescue"). The meaning of redeemer-savior can be seen at 2 Kings 14:26. These terms are used in conjunction with the expression "every male" (lit., "everyone who urinates against the wall") to speak of all the male members of a royal family (1 Kings 14:10; 21:21; 2 Kings 9:8; cf. 1 Kings 16:11).86 The concept of the poem is the same as that expressed in the judgments of Isaiah against Jerusalem in Isaiah 2:6–4:1: Jerusalem will be brought to utter loss of leaders before God establishes his rule on his holy mountain (Isa. 2:2–4). In the poem of Deuteronomy God points out the futility of Israel's turning away from the Rock to serve other gods (32:37). In a taunting rhetorical question God demands to know how these gods will rise to serve as Israel's protection.

<span id="page-294-15"></span><span id="page-294-14"></span><span id="page-294-13"></span><span id="page-294-10"></span><span id="page-294-5"></span><span id="page-294-1"></span>The song returns to the fundamental statement Moses asserted earlier in his exhortation to Israel: "There is no god beside me" (v. 39; cf. 4:35, 39). The language of the absolute unity of God is used by Isaiah to confront blind Israel when she is helpless and despondent (Isa. 43:10–13). Israel is the witness to the truth that there can be no other God than the one who has delivered her. It is only this God who can give life, just as he is the one who brought the death of judgment.

<span id="page-294-6"></span>God now takes an oath by himself (Deut. 32:40). He has sharpened his sword and will take vengeance against his enemies. His arrows will be drunk with the blood of the enemy when he grasps justice in his hand. The significance of the hairy heads of the enemy is not clear. The hair might indicate they are chiefs, or it might be a symbol of strength now defeated. It is unlikely, however, to be a reference to the story of Samson, since that would not be relevant in the context of the enemies of God.

<span id="page-294-8"></span>32:43 The coda of the poem returns to the theme of the opening apostrophe in addressing the heavenly beings and calling on them to give praise. It concludes the theme of verse 41, which is that God will "take vengeance" on his enemies.

<span id="page-294-7"></span><sup>86</sup> For a full study cf. Shemaryahu Talmon and Weston W. Fields, "The Collocation ועזוב ועצור בקיר משתין and Its Meaning," *ZAW* 101/1 (January 1989): 85–112.

It advances this thought by saying that God will cleanse the land that has been polluted by idolatries and other abominations, such as the shedding of innocent blood. Israel is freed not only from the calamities that it has so long endured but also from the sins that have been committed there.

There has been considerable textual corruption in the transmission of this verse. The Masoretic Text, which is found in most English translations, calls upon the nations to acclaim God's deliverance and punishment of the enemy. Such a call to the nations implies the significance of the salvation of Israel for all the world.

<span id="page-295-3"></span>The best-preserved version of the closing stanza is in a fragment of a Qumran scroll now identified as 4QDeutq . 87 In this scroll, three-quarters of a final column contain Deuteronomy 32:41d–43. The stitching is still present to the right of the column. Six lines of verse 43 are preserved complete and clearly. The strophes of the parallel lines appear as follows:

- <span id="page-295-4"></span>(1a) O heavens rejoice with him
- (1b) Bow to him all deities
- (2a) For he will avenge the blood of his sons (2b) Return vengeance on his foes
- (3a) Repay those who reject him (3b) Cleanse his people's land.

The Masoretic Text is missing line 1b and 3a, which is quite clearly deficient, as it breaks up the parallelism of the strophes. The Greek translations have eight lines because they retain an alternate version of the first two lines. It is probable that some of these variations are due to the existence of more than one version of the poem, or at least the closing coda.

<span id="page-295-5"></span><span id="page-295-2"></span><span id="page-295-0"></span>32:44 The subscription recapitulates the reference to the song in 31:22, 30. Moses comes from where he received instructions to teach the poem, or from where he wrote it, and teaches it to the people. According to the Masoretic Text, Moses is assisted by "Hoshea" in the reading of this poem. The name of the successor of Moses was changed to Joshua, according to Numbers 13:16. The difference between "Hoshea" and "Joshua" is the inclusion of the name of God at the beginning of the name.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-295-1"></span>The most important metaphor of the Song of Moses is the one used for God. God is the Rock (Hb. *tsur*)—a crag, an outcropping of a mountain, a large rock formation that can be used as a place of refuge or shelter. In Deuteronomy 8:15 God brought water from the flint stone in the desert. This *tsur* was not a mere stone but the dry barren cliff of a mountain in a parched desert. It is quite logical that the most common application of *tsur* with reference to God is to describe him as a refuge,

<sup>87</sup> This fragment was first published by Patrick W. Skehan, "A Fragment of the 'Song of Moses' (Deut. 32) from Qumran," *BASOR* 136 (December 1954): 12–15.

<span id="page-296-8"></span><span id="page-296-1"></span>a place of protection (e.g., Pss. 18:2; 19:14; Isa. 26:4). This is one of the rare words used more often as a metaphor for God than as an actual feature of the landscape. However, its application to the God of the covenant in the Song of Moses is unique in Scripture.88 Understanding this metaphor is key to understanding the poem. God is introduced by his covenant name, Yahweh (Deut. 32:3). The next verse gives the equivalent of this name as Rock, whose work is perfect. He is characterized by being fair in his dealings, faithful, correct, and upright. This contrasts his covenant partner; they are corrupt, perverse, and twisted. Apart from this perspective it is impossible to appreciate the development of the song.

<span id="page-296-10"></span><span id="page-296-5"></span><span id="page-296-2"></span><span id="page-296-0"></span>The change in emphasis in the poem is the moral character and righteousness of God as *tsur* rather than as a Rock of deliverance and refuge. This concept is also found in a few other passages, such as Psalm 92:15, in which Yahweh is called "upright." In Deuteronomy 32 God as *tsur* is the one who has made Israel and brought them salvation (v. 15). The metaphor of the rock as savior is common, but the present text is not about deliverance from danger. The unique reference here is to the deliverance of Israel when God brought them to Egypt, where they became a great nation, and then brought them out of their slavery. God's choice of Israel expresses his plan, which was to create a nation. Israel was not selected from among existing nations. God's choice was to create a people for himself (vv. 6, 12). The birth of Israel required infant care, and Israel sucked (*wayyeneqehu*) honey from a stone and oil from the flint rock (v. 13). The care of the Rock is like that of a mother who has power to draw food from rock. In this song the Rock of Israel is contrasted with the gods of the nations. The nations have been misled. The rock to whom they have made sacrifices has failed them (vv. 36–38); they will come to realize that the reason for Israel's curses is that their Rock has sold them into the power of their enemy. Enemies of Israel will realize that the Rock of Israel is not like their own rock.

<span id="page-296-7"></span><span id="page-296-4"></span><span id="page-296-3"></span>The development of the theme of how the Rock of Israel has dealt with his people is culturally compelling in covenant exhortation. In the religions surrounding Israel, gods were identified with mountains and the features associated with them. The concepts of strength, safety, and refuge have been taken over from the divine epithet *tsur*. Ancient temples depicted fertility and abundance in images of mountains and rivers. In Canaan this was particularly true of Baal, who was associated with the peak Zaphon (a mountain "in the far north"; Ps. 48:2). The Rock gave birth to Israel, and he was the one who gave them life (Deut. 32:17–18). Concepts of begetting and nurturing were common to the gods of Canaan. The covenant people must always know that these activities belong solely to Yahweh.

<span id="page-296-9"></span><span id="page-296-6"></span>Christians should ponder this poem no less than Israel should. One of the most abused terms in the English language is the word *God*. It is used with only a

This stimulating study shows how the poem develops several images for the care of the covenant God around the Hebrew term *tsur*.

vague of idea of what might be meant. Israelites who memorized this song knew exactly what they meant when they spoke of their God. This was much more than abstract concepts such as omnipotence and omniscience. Israel knew the character and conduct of the person in relationship with them.

**<sup>45</sup>**And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, **<sup>46</sup>**he said to them, "Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law. **47**For it is no empty word for you, but your very life, and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess."

**<sup>48</sup>**That very day the Lord spoke to Moses, **<sup>49</sup>** "Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel for a possession. **50**And die on the mountain which you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people, **51**because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, and because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel. **52**For you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel." 33 This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the people of Israel before his death. **2**He said,

"The Lord came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us;*<sup>1</sup>* he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of holy ones,

- with flaming fire*<sup>2</sup>* at his right hand. **<sup>3</sup>** Yes, he loved his people,*<sup>3</sup>* all his holy ones were in his*<sup>4</sup>* hand; so they followed*<sup>5</sup>* in your steps, receiving direction from you,
- **<sup>4</sup>** when Moses commanded us a law, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
- **<sup>5</sup>** Thus the Lord*<sup>6</sup>* became king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.
- **<sup>6</sup>** "Let Reuben live, and not die, but let his men be few."

**<sup>7</sup>**And this he said of Judah:

"Hear, O Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in to his people. With your hands contend*<sup>7</sup>* for him, and be a help against his adversaries."

**<sup>8</sup>**And of Levi he said,

"Give to Levi*<sup>8</sup>* your Thummim, and your Urim to your godly one, whom you tested at Massah, with whom you quarreled at the waters of Meribah;

- **<sup>9</sup>** who said of his father and mother, 'I regard them not'; he disowned his brothers and ignored his children. For they observed your word and kept your covenant.
- **<sup>10</sup>** They shall teach Jacob your rules and Israel your law; they shall put incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
- **<sup>11</sup>** Bless, O Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those who hate him, that they rise not again."

**<sup>12</sup>**Of Benjamin he said,

"The beloved of the Lord dwells in safety. The High God*<sup>9</sup>* surrounds him all day long, and dwells between his shoulders."

**<sup>13</sup>**And of Joseph he said,

"Blessed by the Lord be his land, with the choicest gifts of heaven above,*<sup>10</sup>* and of the deep that crouches beneath,

- **<sup>14</sup>** with the choicest fruits of the sun and the rich yield of the months,
- **<sup>15</sup>** with the finest produce of the ancient mountains and the abundance of the everlasting hills,
- **<sup>16</sup>** with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwells in the bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph,
- on the pate of him who is prince among his brothers.
- **<sup>17</sup>** A firstborn bull*1 1*—he has majesty, and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he shall gore the peoples, all of them, to the ends of the earth;

 they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh."

**<sup>18</sup>**And of Zebulun he said,

"Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar, in your tents. **<sup>19</sup>** They shall call peoples to their mountain; there they offer right sacrifices; for they draw from the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand."

**<sup>20</sup>**And of Gad he said,

"Blessed be he who enlarges Gad! Gad crouches like a lion; he tears off arm and scalp.

**<sup>21</sup>** He chose the best of the land for himself, for there a commander's portion was reserved; and he came with the heads of the people, with Israel he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments for Israel."

**<sup>22</sup>**And of Dan he said,

"Dan is a lion's cub that leaps from Bashan."

**<sup>23</sup>**And of Naphtali he said,

"O Naphtali, sated with favor, and full of the blessing of the Lord, possess the lake*<sup>12</sup>* and the south."

**<sup>24</sup>**And of Asher he said,

"Most blessed of sons be Asher; let him be the favorite of his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.

- **<sup>25</sup>** Your bars shall be iron and bronze, and as your days, so shall your strength be.
- **<sup>26</sup>** "There is none like God, O Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to your help, through the skies in his majesty.
- **<sup>27</sup>** The eternal God is your dwelling place,*<sup>13</sup>* and underneath are the everlasting arms.*<sup>14</sup>* And he thrust out the enemy before you and said, 'Destroy.'
- **<sup>28</sup>** So Israel lived in safety, Jacob lived alone,*<sup>15</sup>*

 in a land of grain and wine, whose heavens drop down dew.

#### *Section Overview: The Blessing of Moses*

The Song of Moses and the deposit of the Torah for regular reading are concluded with the assurance that these are all the words taught by Moses and with the warning that these words cannot be ignored, because the life of Israel depends on them. God then summons Moses to his death, which provides a transition and an introduction to the parting blessing of Moses.

The blessing of Moses is a poem, though the ancient scrolls do not lay it out in poetic format as they do the song. The poem has obscure words and textual failures, so that often it is difficult to tell whether one is, or both are, making interpretation very difficult. As a poem it may have long been transmitted in ancient script, contributing to the problem. The poem recalls Mount Sinai, in a sense bringing in the experience of the divine presence at the initiation of the ministry of Moses in order to conclude his leadership of Israel in the same way. Moses provides a glimpse into the future of Israel and their life in the Promised Land, somewhat as he did in the song. However, the blessings describe the potential and abundance of the individual tribes, anticipating their opportunities, much as the blessing of Jacob in Genesis 49. Some of the blessings are petitions; others address the tribes themselves. Even those blessings that are descriptions of the tribes are meant as blessings.

<span id="page-300-0"></span>Except for Levi, each of the tribes is spoken of as an individual person. The blessing of some of the tribes are a play on their name; three are compared to animals whose qualities manifest warrior skill. The tribes are not addressed in their order of birth but follow a geographical pattern. Simeon is not mentioned, but it did not have a separate territory, so likely it is to be included with Judah. The poem begins with Reuben, the firstborn, but the tribes are also stationed in the territory that belongs to Reuben. The next tribe is Judah, just across the Jordan, followed by Levi. Since Levi did not have a territory but was based in Jerusalem as the priestly tribe, it logically follows. The list then moves northward listing the Joseph tribes, then west to east (Zebulun, Issachar, and Gad), and finally north and west (Dan, Naphtali, and Asher). The poem concludes with the blessedness of Israel with God as its provider and protector.

<span id="page-301-8"></span><span id="page-301-6"></span><span id="page-301-5"></span><span id="page-301-4"></span><span id="page-301-3"></span>32:45–47 The last words of Moses reported in these verses summarize the giving of the law and the teaching of the song: "Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel." Moses has now both spoken all the words to Israel (Deut. 31:1) and completed the writing of all the words of this Torah (31:24). The words of Moses are a warning (32:46), but this is primarily because of the profound significance of their teaching. The word translated "warning" (Hb. *meʻid*) is used of God's teaching the Ten Words at Mount Sinai (Pss. 50:7; 81:8; cf. 2 Kings 17:15).89 The teaching of Moses comes as a warning because these words are not trifling; they are not empty or without significance. The words of God are life; they are the instruction of the covenant that brings the people into the life-giving power of God. Moses closes with the repeated demand of Deuteronomy, namely, that these words become the imperative of parents to their children so that they may have long life in the land.

<span id="page-301-7"></span><span id="page-301-2"></span><span id="page-301-0"></span>32:48–52 God addresses Moses as he had in Deuteronomy 3:27; substantially the same instruction is also found in Numbers 27:12–14. "That very day" is the day on which Moses completed the teaching of the law and the song just described. The only date given in Deuteronomy is when Moses began to speak on the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year (1:3). Moses is to ascend the range of "Abarim," a name that describes the high hills seen across the Dead Sea from the Promised Land. To reach this mountain, he will have to return a day's march

<span id="page-301-1"></span><sup>89</sup> For a full discussion of the meaning of this word cf. Moshe Weinfeld, *Deuteronomy 1–11*, AB 5 (New York: Doubleday, 1995), 257–262. These two psalms are a celebration of Sinai in a liturgical context, recalling the words God taught them there. The Hebrew word *meʻlid* generally means "testify" but in certain instances can mean "to teach."

<span id="page-302-2"></span>on the route they have come (cf. Num. 33:47–48). From the highest peak at Nebo, Moses will survey the Land of Promise the Israelites will enter under Joshua.

<span id="page-302-1"></span><span id="page-302-0"></span>Moses will not enter the Promised Land because of the transgression at Meribah ("quarrel place") located at Kadesh. The history of the disobedience of Moses when the people murmured because they had no water is recorded in Numbers 20:1–13. There has been much discussion concerning the actual sin of Moses on this occasion, but the best explanation seems to be in what he and Aaron said when they spoke to the rock: "Shall *we* bring water for you out of this rock?" (Num. 20:10). The Torah maintains a very sharp distinction between the power of mortals and that of God. This act of Moses, in which he spoke rashly in using the first person in his command (cf. Ps. 106:3), was a sin that barred him from the Promised Land.90 The explanation for the death of Moses outside the land sets the scene for his final blessing of the people. Moses' being "gathered to [his] people" is not the usual meaning of being buried in an ancestral tomb but refers to the reunion of his spirit with those who have gone before him.

<span id="page-302-8"></span><span id="page-302-4"></span><span id="page-302-3"></span>33:1 This is the fourth heading in Deuteronomy. Previous headings were found at 1:1; 4:44; and 29:1. These headings introduce the book of Deuteronomy and three subsections, namely, the giving of this Torah, the concluding exhortation, and the blessing of Moses. Moses is a "man of God," that is, a prophet whose words shape the future of Israel.

<span id="page-302-6"></span>33:2–5 These verses depict the Lord as charging out in a tempest from the mountains of Sinai at the head of his heavenly armies, his weapons flashing like lightning. He is surrounded by brilliant radiance, accompanied by heavenly beings. The earth quakes in his path, and fire blazes before him. He treads the earth and tramples the nations. In the exordium of the poem God is the warrior who comes to deliver his people. The giving of the law is a sequel to God's emerging from the south (v. 2). God's emergence from the south as the savior is found also in Habakkuk 3:2–7 and Psalm 68:7–8, 15–18

<span id="page-302-7"></span><span id="page-302-5"></span>The last lines of Deuteronomy 33:2 have significant variation in translation. "He came from the ten thousands of holy ones" is also translated with a place name: "[He] approached from Ribelboth-kodesh" (NJPS). This retains the parallel of the previous three lines, which name Sinai, Seir, and Paran. The Hebrew word *qodesh* does mean holy and was taken that way by the Greek translators in parallel with the next line, which refers to God's army. "Flaming fire at his right hand" translates *'eshdath*, a word otherwise unknown and almost certainly textually corrupt. The component *'esh* means "fire," and the remainder might be a corruption of *doleqet* ("blazing"), *lappidot* ("flames"), or *da'ah* ("fly"). The referent of "his holy ones" is ambiguous. It could refer to the armies of Israel protected by God and receiving his Word, or it could be the heavenly armies under his control and at his command (as in Zech. 14:5). Read as Israel's receiving direction from God, it prepares the way

<span id="page-302-9"></span><sup>90</sup> For a full discussion of textual history and other issues around the question of the sin of Moses cf. Milgrom, "Excursus 50," 449–456.

<span id="page-303-7"></span>for Deuteronomy 33:4, in which Israel is the speaker testifying to the law received from Moses. The words of Moses are the heritage of Israel, their legacy. God is their King; he rules in "Jeshurun," the hypocorism referring to Israel as upright.

<span id="page-303-14"></span><span id="page-303-8"></span><span id="page-303-2"></span><span id="page-303-1"></span>33:6 Reuben lost his status as head of the family, as explained in 1 Chronicles 5:1–2. At the death of Rachel, Reuben attempted to prevent the concubine of Rachel from assuming his mother's position at the head of the family (Gen. 35:22). He laid claim prematurely to his inheritance as successor to his father. He would not excel (Gen. 49:3–4). The prayer that Reuben might live must speak to a situation in which the tribe had so shrunk that its very existence was threatened. It may be significant that, in the census of David, Reuben is not mentioned with Gad and Gilead in 2 Samuel 24:5–6.

<span id="page-303-13"></span><span id="page-303-9"></span>33:7 Judah as a tribe came to dominate the whole southern part of the land in the days of David and Solomon, but it also came to be separated from the other tribes. This might be the meaning of restoring him to his people. This is a prayer for protection; it might refer to Judah's fighting on behalf of the other tribes, as in Judges 1:1–20. There Judah was the first to undertake occupation of the unconquered land.

<span id="page-303-12"></span><span id="page-303-10"></span><span id="page-303-6"></span><span id="page-303-5"></span><span id="page-303-3"></span>33:8–11 Levi is the priestly tribe. In Deuteronomy every Levite qualifies to be a priest (cf. Deut. 18:1–8). The "Thummim" and the "Urim" are a means of determining the divine will on important questions. Lots are drawn to determine military matters, ordination for office, and allocation of land. The terms might refer to completeness (Hb. *tom*) and light (*'ur*), but this is only conjecture based on the meaning of the words. Levi was the tribe "tested at Massah [= the testing place]" and "contending at waters of Meribah [= contention]." One example of this was the occasion of the golden calf, in which the Levites stood with Moses (Ex. 32:26–29). The poem does not seem to refer to the incidents at Massah and Meribah as we know them from Exodus 17 and Numbers 20. There the people test Moses, Aaron, and God, who condemns Moses and Aaron. In this text Levi remains faithful when God tests them. Levi has been faithful in executing God's commands, showing no partiality, even to its own families (cf. Ex. 32:26–27). God has now given the Levites the task of administering justice in Israel. Levi carries the full range of instruction, including ritual and all community matters. Incense and whole burnt offerings are daily rituals. The blessing closes with a prayer for material well-being and protection from enemies. Levites are allotted cities and their surrounding area, as well as portions of sacrifices for their services.

<span id="page-303-15"></span><span id="page-303-11"></span><span id="page-303-4"></span><span id="page-303-0"></span>33:12 Rachel died in giving birth to Benjamin (Gen. 35:17–19). As she was dying she named him "son of my sorrow" (ESV mg.) but Jacob named him "son of the right hand" (ESV mg.) meaning he was a child of favor or protection (cf. Ps. 110:1). Benjamin was always a favored son and is similarly described in this blessing. Jerusalem was originally within the territory of Benjamin, which was always a leading tribe. Benjamin became a part of Judah when the kingdom divided, and it remained secure in its territory. The last clause of the blessing as translated in the ESV suggests that God is protecting Benjamin from behind. It could also mean that God dwells in his sanctuary within Benjamin's borders.

<span id="page-304-1"></span>33:13–17 The tribes of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) are blessed in their bounty and military strength. The long poetic list is designed to be comprehensive in stressing the wealth and power of the Joseph tribes. The land of these two tribes includes all central highlands north of Jerusalem and all of Bashan east of Galilee. This rich territory could only be described as blessed of Yahweh. The word "abundance" (Hb. *meged*) is a refrain that repeats with every aspect of the wealth of this territory. It has the sense of "gifts" (*migdanot*) and "choicest [fruits]" (*megadim*). The rain and deep waters are the fruit of the heavens and the earth and are gifts to the people. The crops are the yield of the sun and come in their seasons, represented by the moons. The mountains and hills yield wood, precious stones, metals, and food. The "best gifts of the earth and its fullness" may refer to commerce with other peoples. All of this is the favor of the God encountered by Moses at the "bush" (*saneh*) at *Sinai* (Ex. 3:1–10). Joseph was the favored of all the tribes, the prince (*nazir*) of his brothers (Deut. 33:16).

<span id="page-304-7"></span><span id="page-304-2"></span><span id="page-304-0"></span>Joseph is also described as a warrior, a "firstborn bull" in his majesty. The Chronicler explains that although Reuben was the firstborn, his violation with his father's concubine in seeking to advance his status caused him to lose that status to Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1–2). While Joseph attained the right of firstborn in the family register, Judah became the prince among his brothers. All of this is an interpretation of the Genesis narrative. The brothers become subservient to Joseph, but it is Judah who emerges as their leader. The blessing of Moses follows the outcomes of the story of Jacob's family.

Horns are always a symbol of political and military strength. The armies of Ephraim and Manasseh are like the two horns of a bull in their domination to the ends of the earth.

<span id="page-304-5"></span><span id="page-304-3"></span>33:18–19 Zebulun occupied the territory along the Mediterranean, while Issachar was to the south and east. Moses blesses them in their journeys and dwellings, which seems to be a merism for the whole of their activities, both public affairs and domestic pursuits. The "mountain" is probably Tabor, part of the border of Issachar (Josh. 19:22) and apparently a place of pilgrimage and worship. It is the location at which Deborah and Barak deploy their troops for their defeat of Sisera (Judg. 4:6–16). It is also the place known for its success as a place of worship and other gatherings.

<span id="page-304-6"></span>The two tribes have ready access to the Mediterranean through the long and rich Jezreel Valley. From there they can draw fish from the riches of the sea and shells hidden in the sand, used for dyes, lamps, vessels, and ornaments.

<span id="page-304-4"></span>33:20–21 The blessing of Gad is somewhat enigmatic, due in part to the ambiguity of the terms involved. It seems to relate to Gad's choosing territory in the Transjordan before the rest of the land is conquered. The blessing of enlarging <span id="page-305-11"></span><span id="page-305-9"></span><span id="page-305-3"></span><span id="page-305-2"></span>Gad might refer to its population, in contrast to the prayer for Reuben for survival (Deut. 33:6). The men of Gad are apparently fierce warriors. Those who come to support David in the wilderness are described as having "faces of lions" and as "swift as gazelles upon the mountains" (1 Chron. 12:8). "A commander's portion" translates the rare Hebrew word *mehoqeq*, which means to write laws or decrees (e.g., Isa. 10:1). For this reason the term has sometimes been taken to refer to Moses, who promulgated a law that was the portion of Jacob (Deut. 33:4). But this is rather peripheral to the tribe of Gad. The reference is more likely to the choice of rich grazing land worthy of an esteemed chief. The gathering of the heads of the people may refer to the decision to grant Gad its territory on condition that the tribe lead the armies of Israel in the conquest of the Promised Land (Deut. 3:18; Num. 32:29). Executing the Lord's judgments would be the responsibility the tribe takes in doing its part to bring deliverance to Israel.

<span id="page-305-4"></span><span id="page-305-0"></span>33:22 The tribe of Dan is small but aggressive, like the whelp of a lion leaping on its prey among the herds of Bashan. The territory must be part of the metaphor, as the tribe is north of the Sea of Galilee.

<span id="page-305-5"></span>33:23 The domain of Naphtali is along the western shore of upper Galilee, rich in many varieties of plant production, including woods and fruit trees. The blessing refers to its access to the western and southern shores of the Sea of Galilee.

<span id="page-305-7"></span><span id="page-305-6"></span>33:24–25 Asher is located in upper Galilee west of Naphtali, extending to the Mediterranean. This is a rich territory known especially for its olive oil. It is vulnerable to attack, however, as a coastal tribe on the thoroughfare of major roadways used for commerce and military movements. Bolts on city gates were vital to security. The translation "strength" in Deuteronomy 33:25 is a guess from context, as the Hebrew word *dobe'* is otherwise unknown. It is found in Ugaritic, where "strength" is a suitable meaning.

<span id="page-305-8"></span><span id="page-305-1"></span>33:26–29 The coda of the blessing celebrates the fortune of Israel under the sovereign care of its God. The uniqueness of Israel is in its God, for whom there is no equal. The blessing begins with the praise of the divine warrior who emerges from the mountains of Sinai and concludes with Israel's treading on its fallen enemies. The commander of the armies of heaven (v. 2) is the rider of the clouds (v. 26). The Lord is the shield and sword of Israel; its enemies come cringing before the nation. God has made Israel secure in its dwelling place. Psalm 90:1, a "Prayer of Moses," in similar manner declares that God is a refuge and strength from generation to generation. The provision of God that has brought Israel to this place is its assurance of future blessing.

#### <span id="page-305-10"></span>*Response*

The fortunes of members of the same family are not predictable or equal. The blessing of Moses acknowledges, sometimes implicitly, the great disparity between the various sons of Jacob. Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob, seems to suffer demise to the point at which the tribe is taken over by Gad, with scarcely a distinct territory of its own. Simeon, the second son of Jacob, never does have a territory of its own and receives no mention in the final blessing of Moses. Levi, the third son of Jacob, has no tribal territory but does have cities with surrounding properties. Judah, the fourth son of Jacob, emerges as the leader among the tribes but also appears as very vulnerable. Judah is separated from the other tribes and, for all its striving, must plead for help from his brothers. The sons of Rachel are without question the ones who receive esteem and power. Benjamin is beloved, and the Joseph tribes are endowed with wealth and strength. The other tribes live in vastly differing circumstances, as the small land of Palestine is very diverse.

What all the family members have in common is the provision of God. The brothers are not to be compared in the material fortunes of their lives, which for Deuteronomy is rather immaterial. Although Simeon and Reuben are small, they are no less under divine care and provision that pertains to all Israel. The concluding blessing, declaring this to be a "land of grain and wine" (Deut. 33:28), is true for every tribe, no matter what its independent status may be. "Who is like you . . . !" (v. 29) can be exclaimed of all of them, because all enjoy the redemption of Yahweh.

<span id="page-306-1"></span><span id="page-306-0"></span>Equality is always a point of discussion and contention. All too often comparisons are made without any real thought to what should be meant by *equality* and what factors are truly important. Usually discussions of equality revolve around wealth, but even at that level there is little consideration given as to what differences must be considered if actual equality is to be attained. This is true within individual nuclear families. It is the desire of virtually every parent to treat all his or her children equally. It is the dismay of virtually every parent to discover how difficult equality is to determine and how impossible it is to achieve to the satisfaction of all of the children.

The patriarch Jacob made no pretense of treating all of his children the same, and it is difficult to say that he even attempted to treat them all equally. Rachel was the wife he loved, and it was her oldest son who received the birthright of all the sons. As the tribal destinies unfold, as seen in this blessing, it is evident that in terms of property and wealth the Rachel tribes are superior. Yet in the history of the nation this does not become the determining factor of enduring influence. The leader of the sons of Israel emerges from Judah in spite of all the vulnerabilities of that tribe. Jerusalem becomes the city that represents not only the nation but the kingdom of God. This is not to diminish the significance or importance of any of the other tribes. The blessing of Moses is a lesson in recognizing that every role is to be respected and supported. In every family the value that matters most is for all to be under the care and provision of the life-giver and savior.

### <span id="page-307-4"></span>DEUTERONOMY 34:1–12

34 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan, **<sup>2</sup>** all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, **<sup>3</sup>** the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the Valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. **4**And the Lord said to him, "This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, 'I will give it to your offspring.'

<span id="page-307-2"></span><span id="page-307-1"></span><span id="page-307-0"></span>The book concludes by developing various themes already introduced. These include Moses' being able to view the Promised Land, though unable to enter it (3:25–26), the death of Moses and the succession of Joshua (Deut. 31:1–6), and the superiority of Moses as a prophet (18:15–18). The book began with the last words of Moses spoken in the fortieth year (1:3) and has brought all of his words to conclusion (32:45). The narrator now concludes with the actual events that have been anticipated since he first introduced the setting of the end of Israel's journey.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-308-8"></span><span id="page-308-4"></span>34:1–4 Moses surveys the land as it is described at the beginning of the book (1:7–8). The land is not empty, of course. Moses would see the great city walls and the roadways that provide for the movement of people. What is described here are the various regions. Moses would not be able to view every region, especially those on the west side of the hill country, obscured by the mountains. He sees as far as the area of Dan, Hermon, and Judah, territories extending as far as the Mediterranean Sea.

<span id="page-308-9"></span>34:5–6 It is the usual practice to mark gravesites for the purpose of remembering the life of an individual. There are times when the life of a person may attract unwanted attention for good or bad reasons. There are numerous shrines to saints that do not necessarily contribute to reverence for the individual or to the spirituality of those who travel there. Moses is distinguished as a man of God. The narrator brings closure to that distinction by his description of the burial of Moses. This is the same category as Elijah, who was taken up into heaven (2 Kings 2:1–18); search for Elijah's body confirmed the prophetic message and assured he was not left unburied in disgrace. This account in Deuteronomy serves the same purpose: it assures that Moses is properly buried with divine distinction but that the burial place is not a distraction.

<span id="page-308-13"></span><span id="page-308-12"></span><span id="page-308-10"></span><span id="page-308-5"></span><span id="page-308-3"></span><span id="page-308-1"></span>34:7 The narrative sequence of the chapter is broken up with information about Moses. In the structure of Deuteronomy the sequence from 3:27–28 to 31:2–3 and to Joshua 1:2 transfers the leadership of Moses to Joshua. This information about Moses distinguishes his role as leader. Moses was eighty years old at the time of the burning bush (Ex. 7:7) and one hundred twenty when he began his closing words (Deut. 1:3). One hundred twenty years is a full life of three generations, counting forty years as the representative length of a generation. Moses lives the ideal life according to Genesis 6:3, the maximum that can be expected. Moses also enjoys the ideal health of a human. His vision is clear and his skin unwrinkled. His "vigor" (Hb. *leakh*) is described as "unabated." The epilogue states that he does not have strength to carry on as leader (Deut. 31:2), but God grants him sufficient strength to fulfill the calling given at the burning bush.

<span id="page-308-11"></span><span id="page-308-7"></span><span id="page-308-6"></span><span id="page-308-2"></span><span id="page-308-0"></span>34:8–9 Thirty days are the accepted period of mourning (cf. 21:13). Following this period of mourning the people are prepared to accept Joshua as their leader. Moses made this possible through his earlier anointing. Now Joshua is divinely granted wisdom to follow his calling. The formal anointing by Eleazar the priest is described in Numbers 27:12–23. There Joshua is invested with the authority to carry out his calling. Here he is said to receive divine empowerment.

<span id="page-309-10"></span><span id="page-309-2"></span>34:10–12 The final tribute to Moses in Deuteronomy distinguishes him as the great revelatory agent in the life of the people. The prophets will apply the words of Moses to the circumstances of the people and interpret the covenant for the people. The final great moment of revelation that fulfills that which began at Sinai comes with God's sending his own Son (Heb. 1:1–4). The writer to the Hebrews goes to considerable lengths to show that in Christ the redemption begun in the exodus and the giving of the covenant has come to fulfillment.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-309-9"></span><span id="page-309-7"></span><span id="page-309-6"></span>Psalm 90 is the only song in the Psalter with the title "A Prayer of Moses." It is the first song in the fourth book of the psalter, which exhibits a distinct shift in the songs of redemption. Beginning with the anointing of the Messiah in fulfillment of the Davidic promise in Psalm 2, the psalter is organized around the theme of *kingdom*. The prayer for the king in Psalm 72 concludes book two of the psalter, while the prayer for fulfillment of the covenant with David in Psalm 89 concludes book three with many questions about the future of the Davidic covenant in light of the apparent rejection of the Davidic king. Book four includes psalms of redemption that celebrate the exodus and is appropriately introduced with a Prayer of Moses.

<span id="page-309-8"></span><span id="page-309-4"></span><span id="page-309-1"></span><span id="page-309-0"></span>Psalm 90 divides into three sections. The first section laments the brevity of human life, which, unlike Moses', typically last about seventy years—in contrast to the eternal purposes of God (vv. 1–6). The second section laments the sorrows of life caused by human sin, in contrast to the holiness of God (vv. 7–12). The final section is a prayer for the mercy of God (vv. 13–17). The first petition is for mercy that corresponds to the struggles of each day (vv. 13–15). The second petition is a prayer for fulfillment, that God would take the work of our hands and make it part of his work (vv. 16–17). Both of these petitions are particularly appropriate to the life of Moses.

<span id="page-309-5"></span><span id="page-309-3"></span>The Song of Moses is a reflection on his life, most of which is spent in alienation. The first forty years are in the palace of Pharaoh's daughter, where he is quite aware of being alienated from his people and feels called to be their liberator. His attempt to become their leader results in forty years sidelined as a shepherd somewhere in the land of Midian, married to the daughter of a Midianite priest. At age eighty he likely is not considering the possibility of fulfilling his original vision, but he is called to do exactly that. Yet the result of his faithfully leading his people on an exodus out of Egypt is that, within eleven days of leaving Mount Sinai, he is doomed to roam the wilderness at the head of a cantankerous and rebellious people until the time of his death. In the end he dies in the valley below Mount Nebo, having been able only to view that land he has longed to enter for about 120 years.

What does Moses hope for in the first forty years of wilderness wandering? How does he expect God to take the work of his hands and use it? When the condemnation of another forty years of wilderness wandering comes at Kadesh-barnea, what does Moses hope his life will be? Is there some sort of fulfillment in all this?

<span id="page-310-0"></span>The tribute at the end of Deuteronomy is the only way Moses is remembered most of the time. He is the great prophet who has spoken with God face to face and granted us the revelation that is the beginning of the redemption story. He is *the* prophet of Israel. One might not think that the prophet of Israel should have spent his entire life in wilderness and in alienation, but even that experience points forward to and anticipates the life of the promised Messiah (cf. Phil. 2:6–8). The life of Moses testifies to the truth that what God demands of everyone is what Moses teaches: trust in the face of adversity. The Lord God asks his people to love and fear him, to live with a circumcised heart. Such love and fear might mean eighty years in the wilderness. God does not bring about his redemption in the most understandable manner. Yet in the end God has a glorious redemption planned for his people, which finds its goal and climax in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

## INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA

#### *Overview*

<span id="page-313-1"></span>As the book of Joshua begins, Moses has just died. As the book of Joshua ends, Joshua has just died. The deaths of these two great leaders of Israel frame a book that, in popular perception, has much to do with death throughout. While there is no denying that the narratives of military campaigns and their attendant destruction and loss of life dominate the first half of Joshua, closer inspection discloses that there is much in the book that also affirms life and hope.

This narrative of Israel's entry into and settlement of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants serves as a significant transition point in the history of God and his people. The contrasts between Israel's situation as the book begins and as it ends display the major changes that have been experienced. As the book begins, not only has the great exodus leader, Moses, died but the people remain outside the land, a wandering nation looking westward over the Jordan River to the land that they have understood to be their ancestral inheritance but is presently occupied by others—broadly designated "Canaanites." The people of Israel come to the borders of this land as immigrants or, since their departure from Egypt forty years and a generation earlier, as landless refugees.

But as the book ends, all of that has changed. They are now settled into this landscape, and they are a distributed people with a shared past and a hopeful future. Many of those who previously occupied these cities, towns, and villages are dead, killed by Israelite swords. There are, however, those Canaanites who remain, and whose fractious relationship with Israel will form part of the sequel to this history in the book of Judges. As for Israel, its unity has already been tested, its resilience deepened, and its resolve strengthened to live well as God's people in the place he has gifted to them. As the book begins, Israel carries the ark signifying God's presence with them on their way; as the book ends, God has chosen the first place for his "name to dwell" (Deut. 26:2) in the land and has established it as a meeting place between himself and his people.

<span id="page-313-2"></span><span id="page-313-0"></span>The book divides readily into three main sections. The first section, beginning with an introduction to the whole, occupies chapters 1–12. It tells the history of Israel's entry into the land, presented by a number of allusions and echoes as the counterpart to Israel's departure from Egypt. In these chapters military action dominates as the first probes into the new land provoke hostile responses, leading to a sequence of battles in the central, then southern, then northern territories, in which the indigenous inhabitants are destroyed, routed, or subjugated. The narrator does not linger over details or describe bloody battle scenes; rather this is depicted as holy war, the enactment of sacral destruction at God's command. There are, however, surprises along the way: some Canaanites find life in Israel's midst, while some Israelites, in opposing God as most of the Canaanites did, lose their lives in consequence.

<span id="page-314-3"></span><span id="page-314-2"></span>With the land now in Israel's possession, it remains for the various tribes to settle into its regions. The account of this land allotment is given in chapters 13–21. This process unfolds in three phases. First the leading tribes of the south (Judah) and north (Ephraim and Manasseh) settle into their territories. This is accompanied by a small number of military skirmishes, which are the end of war of any kind in the book. At this point (18:1) the base of Israel's operations shifts to Shiloh; that base had been the border camp of Gilgal, near Jericho, until this time. Second, the remaining tribes are allocated homes after a joint land-survey project identifies suitable divisions. Third, this account finishes with the distribution of cities of asylum and for the tribe of Levi, whose inheritance as the custodians of Israel's worship does not consist of land.

<span id="page-314-5"></span><span id="page-314-4"></span>The final section of chapters 22–24 offers three conclusions, one in each chapter, as Joshua addresses the people, either in part (ch. 22) or as a whole (chs. 23–24). An apparent threat to the unity of God's people provides an opportunity for affirming it. Then, much like the speeches of Moses that cluster near the end of Deuteronomy, Joshua's final speeches exhort Israel to an obedient life on the land and to faithful service of the God who has gifted it to them.

#### *Date and Occasion*

Although the events anonymously narrated in Joshua are set in the period of the horizon between the end of the Late Bronze and the onset of the Iron Age, the book in its current form comes from a much later period and, in all likelihood, incorporates material from very different times. Frustratingly, few chronological controls are present, including nothing that could count as hard evidence by which to date the book. Internal evidence points in more than one direction. The lack of embarrassment regarding the status of Jerusalem and the assumption of the functional cultic role for Shiloh both suggest early memories. The notices that some situation, name, or monument persists in Israel "to this day" is a clear sign of some historical distance from those events.1 The further integration of intertextual elements corresponding with the trajectory into the story of Samuel–Kings (e.g., Josh. 6:26), as well as the theological stylization reflecting later national developments, push the final shaping of the book toward the exilic period. On the other hand, confident

<span id="page-314-1"></span><span id="page-314-0"></span><sup>1</sup> At least twelve occurrences are relevant, with the latter two implying the events are not in the distant past: Joshua 4:9; 5:9; 6:25; 7:26[×2]; 8:28, 29; 9:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10. Cf. 22:3, 18; 23:8, 9, which share the idiom but do not carry this sense, as they are in direct speech.

chronological conclusions cannot be drawn from either the doublets in the lists of city names in the land distribution or the (significant) divergences between the Hebrew text and the Septuagint. Commentators have evaluated such features in strikingly different ways. At best, one can affirm that the book contains materials of varying dates, some of which may be close to the events the book describes, while the book's final shape seems to have been achieved with the benefit of hindsight gained in the exilic period.

This is not to counsel despair concerning the book's purpose—far from it (cf. Theology of Joshua). Rather, this is to appreciate that the traditions preserved in Joshua speak to different staging posts in the history of God's relationship with his chosen people. The book celebrates the achievement of God's promise and the actions of his faithful people in realizing that blessing. It cautions concerning the inherent weakness of the best-intentioned human response to a holy God. Joshua records triumphs, but it is never triumphalist. It contributes significantly to the integrated theological project that runs to the end of 2 Kings, demonstrating how the seeds that will bring divine judgment and national destruction persist even through the high points enjoyed by Israel with its covenant God.

#### <span id="page-315-1"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-315-4"></span><span id="page-315-3"></span><span id="page-315-2"></span>In broad terms, the book of Joshua relates history in prose form. There is remarkably little poetry, with the only clear example found in the brief epic lines found at Joshua 10:12–13, unless the list of kings conquered by Joshua (12:9–24) is also to be regarded as poetry, following the Masoretic convention.2 Beyond the simple prose/ poetry distinction, however, a number of more precise genres may be discerned. The bulk of the narratives in the first part of the book (chs. 6; 8–11) can be regarded as conquest accounts, seeking the destruction of the enemy and promoting the totality of victory. These often bear comparison to ancient Near Eastern annals recording the exploits of kings. The text also includes stories and anecdotes, which have a discernible plot alongside characterization and dialogue (e.g., chs. 2; 7; 22; or Achsah's settlement [15:16–19]). Direct speech is prevalent at the beginning and end of the book (1:1–18; 22:2–5, 8; 23:1–16; 24:2–15), although speeches of varying lengths form a significant part of many of the book's episodes. The speech of 24:2–13 has an even more specific character, as it is deliberately shaped as a prophetic oracle. The settlement account (chs. 13–19) in the second major part of the book may well make use of administrative texts for the geographical lists that describe the tribal allotments, with the more straightforward lists of tribal contributions of cities for asylum and the Levites in chapters 20–21 having a different literary character.

The theology of Joshua naturally shares many of the contours that take shape in God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt. God is sovereign over the

elements and the natural world, just as he is over Egypt's king and its supernatural world, demonstrating both his power and his authority. God demands that his people be sanctified as he meets with them at the mountain, demonstrating his holiness. God's presence accompanies his people on the way and provides for their needs, demonstrating his graciousness. He fights on their behalf to deliver them from hostile nations, showing him to be victorious over every form of opposition. He judges his own people in their rebellion, displaying his justice. He brings them to a good land in accordance with his promise, showing himself to be faithful.

<span id="page-316-11"></span><span id="page-316-10"></span><span id="page-316-3"></span><span id="page-316-2"></span><span id="page-316-0"></span>Each of these theological disclosures encountered in the exodus finds a counterpart in Israel's entry into the Promised Land. God's sovereignty over the elements and natural world is seen in his stopping the Jordan River to allow Israel to cross on dry land (Joshua 3–4) and spectacularly in the celestial events accompanying the battle of the Valley of Aijalon, as Israel delivers its new covenant partner, the people of Gibeon, from hostile kings (10:6–14). His power and authority (cf. Ex. 19:5; "all the earth is mine") are seen in his vanquishing every king that opposes him—for every Canaanite king does so (Joshua 12; cf. Psalm 2). God requires his people to be sanctified at the river (Josh. 3:5) and as they enter the land (5:2–9), for his presence makes it holy (5:15). God requires his people's purification when he judges them for polluting sacred things in an act of disobedience (ch. 7). His presence, represented by the ark, accompanies Israel as they cross the Jordan (chs. 3–4) and march around Jericho (6:11, 13). He fights for them, so that Israel's victories could truly be said to be God's victories in the first place (10:42; 23:9–10). In gifting Israel this good land he graciously provides also for their needs (5:10–12; 24:13). It is a book of promises kept (21:43–45; 23:14).

<span id="page-316-12"></span><span id="page-316-9"></span><span id="page-316-7"></span><span id="page-316-5"></span><span id="page-316-4"></span><span id="page-316-1"></span>Theologically, it is important to affirm that God's holiness is destructive of sin; his presence requires the eradication of that which is contrary to his nature. However, God's love expresses itself in fellowship, and so his removal of sin graciously makes redemption possible.3 As we affirm these deep truths regarding God's nature (cf. Ex. 34:6–7), much of Joshua comes into focus. Insofar as God's creatures recognize and respect God's holiness—that is, as they worship him—his holiness is redemptive, delivering and saving those who thus turn to him. This is, for the most part, Israel's experience in the book, although the episode featuring Achan in Joshua 7 demonstrates that this is not a blessing to be enjoyed automatically. Likewise, for the most part the experience of the Canaanites is to know the inexorable force of God's judgment and his purpose to eradicate that which is abhorrent to him, although this fate is not inevitable for those Canaanites who, like Rahab (chs. 2; 6) or even the Gibeonites (chs. 9–10), acknowledge God's right to their lives and, as a consequence, to save them.

<span id="page-316-8"></span><span id="page-316-6"></span>This truth is conveyed through narrative in the bulk of the book, but the theological concepts are also expressed explicitly in Joshua's closing speeches in chapters 23–24 (cf. 24:19 for their culmination).

<span id="page-316-13"></span><sup>3</sup> Cf. John Webster, *Holiness* (London: SCM, 2003), 47.

#### *Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

Joshua occupies a pivotal place between the preceding books of Moses and the subsequent developments of the federal life of the nation on its way toward monarchy in Judges and the books that follow.

Especially as Israel crosses the Jordan we find numerous echoes of the exodus experience, as the exit from the land of Egypt and the entry to the land of Canaan bookend the narrative. Many passages in Numbers anticipate developments realized in the conquest accounts and form significant cross-references with them. The sermons of Moses on the plains of Moab in Deuteronomy that prepare Israel for its next phase of life likewise forge strong links with some of the diction and outlook of Joshua's opening chapters in particular.

In the other direction, the book of Judges is often thought to contrast sharply with the outlook of Joshua. While at a surface level and in terms of overall tone this is certainly true, one of the burdens of this commentary is to demonstrate that, at a deeper level, Joshua and Judges are intrinsically connected, that the relationship between them is organic and intertwined rather than forced or juxtaposed. The trajectory followed so precipitously in Judges is not alien to the outlook of Joshua but emerges almost inevitably, given the seeds sown in the narrative of this book.

<span id="page-317-4"></span><span id="page-317-1"></span>When it comes to NT connections, a distinction must be borne in mind between the man and the book of Joshua. The figure of Joshua as Moses' successor has only a few echoes in the NT, but these sometimes have to do with episodes outside the book of Joshua itself.4 However, Joshua is named explicitly only twice in the NT (Acts 7:45; Heb. 4:8), while even Rahab gets three mentions (Matt. 1:5; Heb. 11:31; James 2:25).5 The nonmention of Joshua is all the more surprising when one remembers that in Greek he shares Jesus' name: Hebrew "Joshua" is Greek "Jesus." On this basis the Joshua/Jesus type/antitype was exploited in some early Christian writing.6 The book is never quoted directly in the NT, although its wording or episodes are alluded to on a number of occasions. Some of these are quite subtle, however, and the connection is not very illuminating. On the other hand, broad resonances can be discerned between the conflicts represented in the book of Revelation and the battles of Joshua, and these are suggestive for Christian interpretation. On the whole, however, in later reception Joshua and the book that bears his name are very much in the shadow of his great predecessor, Moses.

#### *Preaching from Joshua*

Given the particular difficulties Joshua presents, two of which are considered below, preaching from the book poses challenges. As the book is notorious for its

<span id="page-317-3"></span><span id="page-317-0"></span><sup>4</sup> E.g., Mark 9:38–40, in which the disciples relate to Jesus in the role that Joshua takes in relation to Moses in Numbers 11:28–29.

<span id="page-317-2"></span><sup>5</sup> There is also the intriguing connection with Matthew's identification of a "Canaanite woman" with Rahab as a precursor; cf. Daniel N. Gullotta, "Among Dogs and Disciples: An Examination of the Story of the Canaanite Woman (Matthew 15:21–28) and the Question of the Gentile Mission within the Matthean Community," *Neot* 48/2 (January 2014): 325–340.

<sup>6</sup> For a full exploration of the Joshua/Jesus typological connection among early Christian authors cf. Zev Farber, *Images of Joshua in the Bible and Their Reception* (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2016), 276–365.

violence, the option of simply spiritualizing its stories to provide pious object lessons is unacceptable: this would in any case be a failure to hear what the book can teach contemporary Christians who are willing to attend to it with patience and care. Perhaps it does not need saying, but it is worth being clear that Joshua's violence cannot be proclaimed as a template for Christian action of any kind in the same way that the fate of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5) is not a persistent model for church discipline—in spite of this having occurred in times past (cf. Interpretive Challenges).

<span id="page-318-3"></span>As ever, the preacher's first question should be "What is God doing in this text?" rather than "Where am I in this text?" In the book of Joshua God is directing his people to look to him, calling to strangers, fulfilling his promises, embedding memories of his acts of deliverance, purifying and providing for those he has called, subduing their enemies, disciplining his people's transgressions, upholding his covenant, establishing justice, provoking godly responses, meeting his people at worship, rewarding those who diligently seek him, reminding his people of his fidelity, exhorting them to a corresponding faithfulness, and preparing them to display his holiness. This sketch is hardly exhaustive, but it suggests a dynamic that works through the book and informs the proclamation of good news from a book that often elicits hostile reactions.

It would be too easy, however, to ignore the Canaanites. The book also contains abiding truths concerning the holiness of God's love, the reality of judgment, the inevitability of serving something or someone, the choice of what or whom that master will be as a matter of life-and-death, and the inevitable tragedy of opposing the true and living God. The book of Joshua deepens the gravity of God's word through Ezekiel, "I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord God; so turn, and live" (Ezek. 18:32).

<span id="page-318-2"></span><span id="page-318-1"></span><span id="page-318-0"></span>The narratives of Joshua 1–12 and the three closing chapters lend themselves readily to preaching that attends to the faithfulness of the God of promise, the patterns God weaves in his redemptive work, and the covenant-shaped engagement of God with people that points to the foundations of divine indicatives (the truth of who God is for his people) for hearing the claim of divine imperatives (the obedience God requires of his people). Each of these, too, has a natural trajectory to its fuller realization in the gospel of Jesus Christ and the faithful community life of the church. The land distribution chapters (13–21) should not be neglected, however. They may call for more creative handling, but the framing of this phase of Israel's life in the land still has significant things to say about what it means to settle well, what responsiveness to God's gracious gifts looks like, how God shapes his people for being a nation rather than nomads, and how a place is found for the exercise of justice and the practice of gathered worship.

#### *Interpretive Challenges*

Joshua shares with a number of other biblical books certain challenges for twentyfirst-century readers: historicity, the reality of miracles, text-critical issues, and so on. But two stand out as especially pertinent for any close engagement with this book in particular: (1) divinely mandated slaughter of the Canaanites and (2) the close attention to the geography and topography of its events in the first half of the book, and even more so in the settlement of the second half.

(1) There is no evading the violence that occurs throughout the book of Joshua.7 In Joshua this is especially associated with the technical Hebrew term *kherem* (and its related verb), sometimes translated by "ban" in English or more expansively, as in the ESV, by "devoted thing" or the like. In Joshua, since the Canaanites and their gods and goods are designated as *kherem*, God declares that as a totality they are "devoted to destruction." It is for this reason that the book has been seen as "genocidal," as is the God who gives the command (cf. Deut. 7). There is an obvious difficulty for evangelical readers of Scripture here: clearly, genocide is immoral yet in relation to the conquest of Canaan it appears that God commands it. Is God, then, immoral too?8

<span id="page-319-0"></span>Over the centuries a number of strategies have been developed for avoiding the force of this dilemma, ranging from dismissing the charge against God as impossible, since all of God's actions are inherently moral, to dismissing the text as incompatible with an enlightened faith. Neither of these approaches is satisfactory. Other attempts at a solution are frequently made, some of which are untenable, while others are fairly limited in achieving their goal, including (a) historicalcritical readings that seek to show the texts of Joshua to be "late" and the conquest tales to be nothing more than tales, (b) readings that argue the Canaanites were sufficiently morally reprehensible that they deserved their fate, (c) comparisons of Joshua to other ancient conquest accounts that claim the language in Joshua is exaggerated, and (d) arguments that hold that the battles of Joshua cannot be called genocide since that is a modern concept applied anachronistically to the OT.

This last point deserves further reflection. Extermination of one population by another by whatever means was framed as genocide under the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (December 1948), which defined the term as any act "committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group." It is easy to see how the events of Joshua correspond to that definition. Yet there are problems with the application of this concept to Joshua beyond the real but ineffective observation that it is anachronistic. First, it is clear from the testimony of Joshua itself that many elements of the Canaanite population persisted in the land; there was no extermination, and the totality language the book adopts should be seen

<sup>7</sup> For an introductory orientation to the issues as they bear on the book of Joshua cf. Douglas Earl, *The Joshua Delusion? Rethinking Genocide in the Bible* (Eugene, OR: Cascade, 2010). On the history of Christian responses to the issue cf. Christian Hofreiter, *Making Sense of Old Testament Genocide: Christian Interpretations of* Herem *Passages* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018). For constructive contemporary attempts by Christians to resolve this dilemma cf. C. S. Cowles et al., *Show Them No Mercy: Four Views on God and Canaanite Genocide* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2003). For Jewish perspectives cf. Katell Berthelot, Joseph E. David, Marc Hirshman, eds., *The Gift of the Land and the Fate of the Canaanites in Jewish Thought* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014).

<sup>8</sup> On these claims cf. Paul Copan and Matthew Flannagan, *Did God Really Command Genocide? Coming to Terms with the Justice of God* (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2014). While Copan and Flannagan handle these concepts with philosophical dexterity and care, the emotional force remains.

as a consequence of ancient literary conventions.9 Second, to reduce the action to "genocide" is to remove God from consideration. To some skeptics this may be a welcome outcome, but it is not the biblical perspective.

Five affirmations provide a framework for understanding this challenging biblical concept:

<span id="page-320-1"></span>(a) The OT does speak of a God who kills. It is God who brings death for sin, and all life and death are at God's behest. Deuteronomy 32:39 shows this:

 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.

<span id="page-320-0"></span>Israel feels the force of this truth long before the Canaanites do, such as in the aftermath of the golden calf episode (Ex. 32:27–28).

(b) Bronze Age people have a "Bronze Age deity." There is something to the argument that ancient conquest accounts use conventional language and communicate in forms that are rooted in that time and place. The principle in antiquity is clearly articulated in a political vein in the book of Daniel in connection with a Babylonian king, but it applies equally to the political theology of Joshua:

O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty. And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled. (Dan. 5:18–19)

<span id="page-320-5"></span><span id="page-320-4"></span><span id="page-320-2"></span>(c) The God who brings death also gives life. This is affirmed already in the Song of Moses (Deut. 32:39), but it runs like a thread through Scripture as well. Psalm 85 is eloquent testimony to the restorative grace of a God whose anger is not prolonged (cf. Psalm 103) but whose "salvation is near to those who fear him" (Ps. 85:9). In the book of Joshua, Rahab is the most obvious example of a foreigner who comes to enjoy life in the presence of this God, but she is not alone.10

<span id="page-320-3"></span>(d) The holiness of God must be confronted. This reality has already been explored (cf. Theology of Joshua), but it is crucially important for this theme. What is holy cannot tolerate the polluted—the entire priestly/sacrificial system that points to the cross of Calvary is predicated on this affirmation.

(e) Christian reflection on Joshua must also engage NT perspectives. The third affirmation above already points in the direction of the gracious, redeeming love of God that is of a piece with his gracious, electing love. So Paul could counsel the Gentile Christians in Rome, "Note then the kindness and the severity of God:

<sup>9</sup> Cf. K. Lawson Younger Jr, *Ancient Conquest Accounts: A Study in Ancient Near Eastern and Biblical History Writing*, JSOTSup 98 (Sheffield, UK: Sheffield Academic, 1990).

<sup>10</sup> Cf. D. G. Firth, "Joshua 24 and the Welcome of Foreigners," *AcT* 38/2 (2018): 70–86.

<span id="page-321-5"></span>severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off" (Rom. 11:22). Ultimately, however, God's redemptive purpose finds its culmination in a representative individual, for he "did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all" (Rom. 8:32).

<span id="page-321-4"></span>While the fate of the Canaanites as a group speaks to the severity of God, the saving of some and the tolerance of others is just one pointer in the trajectory of salvation history that finds its climax in the incarnation, humiliation, crucifixion, resurrection, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ.

(2) The concept of the land is a prominent theme in biblical theology. However, while land has a central importance in the OT and informs much of the book of Joshua, it has a lesser place in NT thinking and, as a consequence, is sometimes overlooked in Christian reflection on this book. Oliver O'Donovan identifies the contrasting roles that "place" plays in the two Testaments:

The Old Testament is the story of a love affair between a tribe and its God, and a piece of land is the token of their affection and disaffection. The New Testament is the charter of a world faith with eternity in view . . . [and] systematically cancels the [OT's] preoccupation with land and city.11

<span id="page-321-2"></span><span id="page-321-1"></span><span id="page-321-0"></span>Here again there is a trajectory from the OT to the NT in which Joshua plays a significant role, even if this contrast—stated in its sharpest terms by O'Donovan is subject to refinement. The gifted land is a place of meeting for God and people, first expressed briefly, even tentatively, in Joshua 18. Beyond Joshua's horizon, Jerusalem will come to be identified most fully with the dwelling place of God with his people (cf. 1 Kings 8), but even this will prove to be in some sense temporary, as seen in Jeremiah 7:1–15. The hopes that it kindles are pointedly expressed in the magnificent finale to Ezekiel's vision of a new temple and land, the last verse of his long book: "And the name of the city from that time on shall be, The Lord Is There" (Ezek. 48:35). The frailty of Joshua's achievement, poignantly captured in the book's final three chapters, contributes to the growing realization that this place for God's presence is not finally the place of "rest" of which the book speaks on several occasions. There is another "rest" (cf. Hebrews 4) to which the tensions in the book of Joshua point, of which God's presence is itself the place—a "better country, that is, a heavenly one" (Heb. 11:16).

#### <span id="page-325-2"></span>OVERVIEW OF

### JOSHUA 1:1–12:24

The first major section of Joshua readily falls into a number of episodes, as different characters and narrative moments come into focus. At the same time, a single narrative arc flows from chapter 1 to chapter 12, into which certain necessary asides are accommodated. The level of continuity is more pronounced than a casual reading might suggest. While the analytical outline of the introduction sets out its components, the shape might be better conveyed in this form:

### <span id="page-326-0"></span>JOSHUA 1:1–9

1 After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' assistant, **<sup>2</sup>** "Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel. **3**Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses. **4**From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory. **5**No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you. **6**Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them. **7**Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success*<sup>1</sup>* wherever you go. **8**This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. **9**Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-327-0"></span>The first chapter of Joshua is dominated by direct speech. In the first half of the chapter God speaks directly to Joshua; in the second half Joshua addresses the people in two phases. God's words to Joshua are intimately bound up with passages from the Pentateuch that anticipate his leadership of Israel in succession to Moses (cf. Num. 27:12–23; Deut. 31:1–8; 34:9–12). The echoes in Joshua 1:1–9 are readily detected by those familiar with these passages. Therefore, rather than serving as fresh disclosures, God's words to the freshly installed leader serve as confirmation of assurances previously given for the task that awaits. After the scene is set in 1:1, 1:2–4 focuses on the task at hand, while 1:5–9 delves into Joshua's character and God's provision in tightly interconnected language. These verses also sketch the shape and movement of the book as a whole, from crossing the Jordan (1:2; cf. 3:1–5:15) and taking the land (1:3; cf. 2:1–24; 6:1–12:24) to settling its territories (1:4; cf. 13:1–19:51) and heeding the call to an obedient life (1:5–9; cf. 22:1–24:33).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-327-2"></span>1:1 Death frames the book of Joshua. Moses' death marks its beginning, and two deaths (and three funerals) conclude it.

It is right that Moses' death should be in the foreground. We find signals of newness as Joshua begins: a fresh page, a bold title, a chapter numbered one. So we understand that the book stands apart from what has gone before. We are no longer in the five books of Moses, that is, the Pentateuch, the Torah. In one sense, <span id="page-328-4"></span><span id="page-328-0"></span>the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy could be seen as Moses' biography, beginning with his dramatic birth in Exodus 2 and drawing to an end with his remarkable death in Deuteronomy 34. Nowhere else do we see a character whose span of life covers so much of the biblical text. Not only that, but Moses is depicted as unique and without successor in the verses immediately preceding the book of Joshua (Deut. 34:10–12; but cf. Deut. 18:15). Thus the opening words draw us into an unfolding story in which we experience both a profound disjuncture as well as an insistent continuity "*after* the death of Moses" (Josh. 1:1).

<span id="page-328-12"></span><span id="page-328-7"></span><span id="page-328-5"></span><span id="page-328-3"></span>The sense of the passing of an era, with its succession in leaders, is further reinforced by the brief descriptions accompanying their names. While the phrase "servant [*ʿebed*] of the Lord" applied to Moses (also in v. 2) seems familiar enough, as a set phrase its use is restricted and the pattern distinctive.12 Its first appearance in the Bible is at Deuteronomy 34:5, the very moment of Moses' death. It is then applied to him a further fourteen times in the book of Joshua and on three further occasions in the historical books (2 Kings 18:12; 2 Chron. 1:3; 24:6). Only at Joshua's death is he too called the "servant of the Lord" (Josh. 24:29; repeated at Judg. 2:8). Twice David is apparently also identified by this phrase, in the superscriptions to Psalms 18 and 36. Once it is used of Israel as "servant" in Isaiah 42:19. Clearly Moses is the "servant of the Lord" par excellence, a fitting status for one "whom the Lord knew face to face" (Deut. 34:10).

<span id="page-328-13"></span><span id="page-328-10"></span><span id="page-328-6"></span><span id="page-328-1"></span>The contrast with Joshua's own designation is striking: he is Moses' "assistant" or "attendant" (Hb. *mesharet*; cf. Ex. 24:13; 33:11; Num. 11:28). At the seven other instances in which this term is used it refers consistently to an underling of some sort, and this nuance applies here as well. This differs from *ʿebed*, which can apply to a very wide social range, from slave to high royal official.

In a few brief words, then, our narrator plunges us into the reality of this turning point in Israel's national history and this moment of trauma, and even crisis, in Joshua's personal story. The great leader of the people—the "servant of the Lord," no less—is dead, and now his assistant remains. And it is this one to whom the Lord now speaks.

<span id="page-328-8"></span><span id="page-328-2"></span>1:2 In the rest of this section the Lord speaks directly to Joshua. This is the longest and thematically richest divine speech in the book. The fact of God's speaking to Joshua is significant in the light of Moses' death, as it emphasizes the continuity of divinely mandated prophetic leadership of the people, much as Eleazar's succession to Aaron functions in priestly terms (cf. Num. 20:25–28). God's actions on behalf of his people and his disclosures to them through their representative are not restricted to a single individual, as the Lord himself clarifies in his next word to Joshua (cf. Josh. 3:7). It is important to note, though, that the number of divine speeches, as well as their length, declines as the story unfolds. The last words of the Lord to Joshua (roughly equal in length to the first speech, and next longest)

<span id="page-328-14"></span><span id="page-328-11"></span><span id="page-328-9"></span><sup>12</sup> This is for the singular "servant of the Lord" only. For plural "servants of the Lord" cf. 2 Kings 9:7; 10:23; Psalms 113:1; 134:1; 135:1; Isaiah 54:17. In divine speech "my servant(s)" is also found more frequently.

<span id="page-329-9"></span><span id="page-329-8"></span>initiate the distribution of land for tribal settlement in 13:1–7 and the designation of cities of refuge in 20:1–6. The Lord is training his people to attend to him and to live faithfully before him by means other than direct speech to their leader. But as Israel grows to maturity in the land, God speaks directly to their leader still.

<span id="page-329-2"></span>The first words the Lord speaks to Joshua confirm the current reality (Moses is indeed dead) and spell out the current task ("go over this Jordan"!). The context has been set in Deuteronomy 34, which recounts not only Moses' death but also the completion of the period of mourning, including the affirmation of Joshua's spiritual equipping to serve as Israel's leader in succession to Moses. At the same time, the Lord reminds Joshua that he is not alone, that the task to which he is being called is not carried out in isolation; rather, he is in the company of God's people, who together with him are recipients of the gift of the Land of Promise.

<span id="page-329-5"></span>1:3–4 Place is, naturally, of enormous importance in the book of Joshua. It can be difficult for modern Christian readers to sense this importance. Once we have registered that it is the Promised Land to which Israel is going and into which they are settling, many modern readers tend to lose interest. The place names, itineraries, and boundaries so carefully described especially in the second half of the book can appear to be simply the necessary but still tedious entailment of the giving and taking of the land.

<span id="page-329-3"></span>But embedded into this first, significant divine speech to Joshua is a brief but expansive statement registering the shape of the landscape into which Israel is moving. The first note of plural interest from verse 2 ("the land that I am giving *to them*") carries into this geographical notice in verses 3–4. Each of the secondperson references in these verses is plural: "*your* foot," "given to *you*," "*your* territory." In speaking of place, the Lord speaks to Joshua not as an individual, as he does throughout the rest of this address, but as a member of the people of Israel. The grammar contains a further sign of divine providence in verse 3: while the people's traversing the land and subsequent demarcation of territory lie in the future ("sole of your foot *will tread* upon"), God's act of giving has already taken place in the divine decree ("I *have given* to you") and is seen as complete.

<span id="page-329-7"></span><span id="page-329-6"></span><span id="page-329-4"></span><span id="page-329-1"></span><span id="page-329-0"></span>The boundaries are sketched in verse 4, moving in a counterclockwise sweep roughly through southern, eastern, northern, and western orientations. The language in verses 4–5 echoes Deuteronomy 11:24–25, which forms part of one of Moses' addresses to the people encouraging obedience and fidelity. There are some small differences between the texts, but the confirmation of the geographical extent of Israel's occupation with the divine gift is largely a verbatim repetition. Here in Joshua the boundaries are more expansive than those outlined in Deuteronomy. Nor do they correspond precisely to the landscapes of conquest in Joshua 13–19. The OT includes other boundary passages besides these (e.g., Num. 34:1–12; Ezek. 47:13–20), each showing some differences. It is likely, then, that these broad outlines of boundaries are meant to be inclusive and ideal rather than exhibiting the precision needed for drawing a map.

<span id="page-330-5"></span><span id="page-330-4"></span><span id="page-330-1"></span>1:5 As Joshua 1:5 begins, the echo from Deuteronomy 11:24–25 persists but is shifted now into a new direction. While in Moses' address the assurance that "no one shall be able to stand against you" (Deut. 11:25) is offered to the people, here it is applied to Joshua himself, both by means of the singular "you" as well as through the association with his own span of life. In some sense, the provision of Joshua as leader of Israel acts as a visible symbol of God's presence with them, and so his life serves as a kind of guarantor of the divine promise. Moses has died, but Joshua is alive (cf. Num. 27:22; Deut. 31:23). This is reinforced by the promise that the divine presence enjoyed by Moses—and won by his intercession at Mount Sinai, as narrated in Exodus 33—will also continue with Joshua. The assurance of persistent presence with which the verse concludes has further resonance with the commission of Joshua in Deuteronomy 31, where it is offered by Moses on the Lord's behalf first to the people (Deut. 31:6) and then to Joshua himself (Deut. 31:8).13 The promise of divine presence, then, has a context: the taking, inhabiting, and settling of the gifted land. Divine presence is a function of Joshua's participation in the mission to which he has been appointed.

<span id="page-330-14"></span><span id="page-330-13"></span><span id="page-330-12"></span><span id="page-330-11"></span><span id="page-330-10"></span><span id="page-330-9"></span><span id="page-330-8"></span><span id="page-330-7"></span><span id="page-330-2"></span><span id="page-330-0"></span>1:6–9 The injunction to "be strong and courageous" naturally follows in verse and is repeated in Joshua 1:7, 9 and again at verse 18 in a slightly surprising context. This too has an explicit link to Moses' commission of Joshua in Deuteronomy, shared by Israel and Joshua together (Deut. 31:6–7) and applied specifically to Joshua by the Lord (Deut. 31:23; cf. 3:28).14 Given the demands of the strenuous military campaign that immediately awaits, this counsel is expected and is the concern of Joshua 1:6. This is, however, no ordinary call to be battle ready. Rather, as verses 7–8 go on to detail, the "courage" demanded of Joshua has to do more with obedience to the word of God than with fortitude in the face of the enemy. The place of the law in Joshua's life—whether it is remembered by Joshua from the mouth of Moses (v. 7) or pondered by him in written form (v. 8)—mirrors the situation of the future kings as stipulated in Deuteronomy 17:18–20. The two contexts have different situations in mind, as well as differently shaped outcomes, but in both cases it is the same high calling to be immersed in God's law and to live in fidelity to it that leads to the result God intends for the welfare of his people and the benefit of their human leader.

<span id="page-330-16"></span><span id="page-330-15"></span><span id="page-330-6"></span>With the reiteration of terms in Joshua 1:9 reinforcing the instruction of the preceding verses, this first direct word of the Lord to Joshua draws to a close. It brings with it a repetition of the promise of God's presence, now put positively as the mirror of the negations at the end of verse 5 and extended from the expanse of time of Joshua's life in that verse ("all the days of your life") to his movements in the landscape of the Promised Land in verse 9 ("wherever you go"). Altogether, then, the courage to which Joshua is called is not a self-willed, tenacious, physical

<span id="page-330-18"></span><span id="page-330-17"></span><sup>13</sup> This assurance also appears in David's charge to Solomon in 1 Chronicles 28:20, but that parallel has deeper significance for Joshua 10:25 (cf. comment on 10:22–27).

<span id="page-330-3"></span><sup>14</sup> When used as a set pair the word for "be strong, strengthen" (some form of *hazaq*) consistently precedes the word for "be courageous" (some form of *ʾamats*), despite the English sequence in Deuteronomy 3:28.

bravery in the face of hostility or danger but an outcome of spiritual equipping for, and divine presence in, the God-given task that claims him.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-331-1"></span>The twelve divine speeches in Joshua each contains at least one of four elements: reassurance, instruction, encouragement, or confirmation of divine gift-giving.15 Only this speech in 1:2–9 contains all four elements, resulting in an appropriately full word for Joshua as he takes up the role vacated at Moses' death. The book begins, then, with eyes open to not only the finitude of human leaders but also the gracious provision of the ever-living God. There is a strong resonance here with the counsel and praise of the psalmist: "Put not your trust in princes. . . . Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, . . . who keeps faith forever" (Ps. 146:3–6).

<span id="page-331-6"></span><span id="page-331-5"></span>At the same time, a theme is also emerging that is felt at its sharpest in Joshua 10–12: the contributions of God and Joshua in their joint endeavor are not fifty-fifty. Rather, it is all God, for it is he who gives and enables (this is the point of the promise of divine presence), *and* all Joshua ("*you* shall cause this people to inherit," 1:6; "then *you* will make your way prosperous," 1:8). Profound mysteries are at work here, yet the Lord's words to Joshua demand such a supernatural calculus.

<span id="page-331-7"></span><span id="page-331-3"></span><span id="page-331-2"></span>God's purpose in this is to restore a place in which to dwell with his rightly ordered people in fulfillment of his promise. Thus it was in the beginning, in a particular place—a garden—with Adam and Eve. And thus it will be in the end of time, when, as the book of Revelation describes, there will be a city in which the "dwelling place of God is with man" (Rev. 21:3) but in which there will be no temple, "for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" (Rev. 21:22). Again, this passage gives us the first glimmers of this theme that is worked out more fully as the book unfolds.

<span id="page-331-8"></span>There is a danger in reading these stirring words of God to Joshua. Reading devotionally, we are tempted to see ourselves in Joshua's place and to hear these words as being addressed directly to ourselves. However, we are not Joshua. He is the seasoned servant of Moses, the one who worked for decades at Moses' side and will now lead Israel into the Promised Land as the divinely appointed successor to Israel's departed deliverer. Joshua, as it were, provides closure to the divine promise given to Abraham ("I will give to you and to your offspring . . . all the land of Canaan"; Gen. 17:8), Isaac, and Jacob. We can too easily and superficially put ourselves into Joshua sandals and think in terms of the challenges we face. However, we have been permitted to overhear these words, and thus we can make a more fundamental observation: we may not be Joshua, but we serve the same God. God's affirmations come to one embarking on the task of living out God's call on his life. The author of Hebrews is able, then, to recall the repeated

<span id="page-331-4"></span><span id="page-331-0"></span><sup>15</sup> On one occasion (Josh. 7:10–13) there is also reproof. The brief speech in 8:1–2, following Israel's recovery after the lapse at Ai, includes three elements (encouragement, instruction, and the gift note); the rest have only one or two.

<span id="page-332-5"></span><span id="page-332-0"></span>promise of presence made to Joshua and to apply it to those Christians he is urging to live faithfully, quoting Joshua 1:5: "For he has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'" (Heb. 13:5).

### <span id="page-332-2"></span>JOSHUA 1:10–18

**<sup>10</sup>**And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, **<sup>11</sup>** "Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, 'Prepare your provisions, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess.' "

**<sup>12</sup>**And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said, **<sup>13</sup>** "Remember the word that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, 'The Lord your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.' **14**Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them, **15**until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it, the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise."

**<sup>16</sup>**And they answered Joshua, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. **<sup>17</sup>** Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you, as he was with Moses! **18**Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-332-3"></span><span id="page-332-1"></span>Three distinct speeches follow from the Lord's words to Joshua. Joshua first prepares the people for action (1:10–11). He then offers a separate reminder to the Transjordan tribes (vv. 12–15; cf. comment there) of the arrangements made with Moses and the obligation of the fighting men to accompany the rest of the people into the territories on the west of the Jordan. They will leave their households and belongings on the east side of the Jordan, in the region previously allotted to them. Finally, these tribes make an affirmative response to Joshua (vv. 16–18) that contains something of a surprise ending.

In Numbers 11:16 and on several occasions in Deuteronomy these men are aligned with (even drawn from) the "elders" of Israel yet are distinct from them. In Deuteronomy 20:5–9 they exercise a management function in a military rather than civilian capacity. They are drawn into judicial functions in Deuteronomy 16:18 and in the late texts of 1 Chronicles 23:4; 26:29, although 2 Chronicles 19:11; 34:13 puts them within the sphere of the Levites and scribes. When we meet them later in the book of Joshua, they form part of a group with elders and judges (Josh. 8:33; 23:2; 24:1). Across these texts, then, the *shoterim* are seen as exercising a broad organizational authority in the life of the Israelite community, one in which such authority is derived rather than inherent; this is a matter of function, not status. Here that authority involves serving as the conduit for Joshua's commands to the wider populace (cf. 3:2), much as Joshua himself is the conduit for God's commands to his people.

<span id="page-333-13"></span><span id="page-333-12"></span><span id="page-333-11"></span><span id="page-333-10"></span><span id="page-333-8"></span>1:11 The narrative chronology in Joshua can be difficult at times for the modern reader to follow. Here, Joshua stipulates "three days" of preparation before breaking camp and crossing into the gifted land. This is resumed at 3:2, but intervening is the story of the "spies" (2:1) in Jericho in chapter 2. This story includes its own three-day span (2:22), although that episode as a whole would seem to require more time than that to be completed. It could be, then, that "three days" is more like our "a few days," and the reader of these stories is to fit them together as a single unfolding chronology.

<span id="page-333-9"></span><span id="page-333-6"></span><span id="page-333-2"></span>1:12–15 God's speech in verses 1–9 included several implied references to passages in both Numbers and Deuteronomy, and the same is true here. As a group, "the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh" are sometimes designated by commentators as the "Transjordan tribes" or the "eastern tribes" or even the "two and a half tribes." The origins of this grouping are found in Numbers 32, particularly verses 19–32. They are grouped at a few points as the book proceeds (Josh. 4:12; 12:6; 13:29; 18:7). The exchange here, however, serves as something of a foreshadowing of the dramatic events of chapter 22. In this way the claims

of the people as a whole before God.

<span id="page-334-6"></span><span id="page-334-3"></span><span id="page-334-2"></span><span id="page-334-1"></span>The arrangements with the Transjordan tribes made in Numbers 32 find a summary repetition in Deuteronomy 3:18–20; the latter passage provides the template for Joshua's words here. One small but significant difference should be noted: the opening words ("The Lord your God is providing you a place of rest"; Josh. 1:13) do not feature in the arrangements either of Numbers 32 or of the summary in Deuteronomy 3:18–20. The closest parallel found in Moses' speeches is Deuteronomy 12:10, which concerns the people as a whole in anticipation of the new arrangements for worship that will come into force when the Lord "gives you rest from all your enemies."17 For the writer to the Hebrews, the theme of rest marks out Joshua for comment (Heb. 4:8) between Moses (Heb. 3:2, 3, 5, 16) and Aaron (Heb. 5:4). Here the theme puts down a marker that will be picked up again in Joshua 22:4, providing an explicit link between this passage as the people prepare to enter the land with the later one narrating the dangers encountered in their first settled days in their territories.

<span id="page-334-14"></span><span id="page-334-13"></span><span id="page-334-11"></span><span id="page-334-8"></span><span id="page-334-7"></span><span id="page-334-4"></span><span id="page-334-0"></span>1:16–18 The collective response of the Transjordan tribes is swift, affirmative, and comprehensive. It is everything that Joshua could hope it would be, and it gives expression, at least from this segment of the people, to the same notes of continuity as those expressed by the Lord in 1:5 in particular. The chain of command from the Lord through the ordained leader and to the rest of the people persists unbroken. The Transjordan tribes' closing words in verse 18 are striking on two counts. First, their commitment to put to death any disobedient Israelites is sobering and, looking back, may have a resonance with the zeal of Phinehas (cf. Num. 25:6–12). Looking ahead, it also provides a foreshadowing of events nearer than those of Joshua 22: these words contemplate the possibility of infidelity in Israel's ranks and the deadly outcome of such behavior. It will come true all too quickly. The other surprise is found in their encouragement back to Joshua to "be strong and courageous." These are the same words as those spoken by the Lord to him (1:6, 7, 9). In literary terms they provide a strong sense of closure to the opening chapter of Joshua. More importantly, we hear, just for a moment, a portion of Israel sounding very much like their God.

#### <span id="page-334-10"></span><span id="page-334-5"></span>*Response*

Joshua is not Moses, but already in this first chapter he is depicted as standing fully in continuity to Israel's great exodus leader, completing the work he began and carried out faithfully to the very brink of entry into the Promised Land. As Joshua begins to step into the role, the first response he receives expresses wholehearted commitment to the one provided by the Lord to lead his people—and that commitment is itself an outworking of a fundamental fidelity to the Lord

<span id="page-334-12"></span><span id="page-334-9"></span><sup>17</sup> The theme of rest is also a feature of the notices of promises fulfilled in Joshua 21:44; 23:1. Cf. 1 Chron. 22:18, where "rest" (ESV mg.) is the context for David's encouragement to Solomon to press on with construction of the temple.

himself. The pattern is found throughout Scripture, in both the formation of Israel in the OT and the ministry of Jesus leading to the subsequent development of the church in the NT. The failure of this pattern will be felt with devastating consequences in the book of Judges. Where an authorized leader—called and equipped by God, recognized and respected by the community in the context of faithful living—is present, the framework for the flourishing of God's people is in place.

### <span id="page-335-0"></span>JOSHUA 2:1–24

2 And Joshua the son of Nun sent*<sup>1</sup>* two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab and lodged there. **2**And it was told to the king of Jericho, "Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land." **3**Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land." **<sup>4</sup>**But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, "True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. **<sup>5</sup>**And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them." **6**But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof. **<sup>7</sup>** So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out.

**<sup>8</sup>**Before the men*<sup>2</sup>* lay down, she came up to them on the roof **<sup>9</sup>** and said to the men, "I know that the Lord has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. **10**For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction.*<sup>3</sup>* **<sup>11</sup>**And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no spirit left in any man because of you, for the Lord your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. **12**Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a sure sign **<sup>13</sup>** that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death." **14**And the men said to her, "Our life for yours even to death! If you do not tell this business of ours, then when the Lord gives us the land we will deal kindly and faithfully with you."

**<sup>15</sup>**Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived in the wall. **16**And she said*<sup>4</sup>* to them, "Go into the hills, or the pursuers will encounter you, and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned. Then afterward

you may go your way." **17**The men said to her, "We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours that you have made us swear. **18**Behold, when we come into the land, you shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's household. **<sup>19</sup>**Then if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be guiltless. But if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head. **20**But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath that you have made us swear." **21**And she said, "According to your words, so be it." Then she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.

**<sup>22</sup>**They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned, and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing. **23**Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they told him all that had happened to them. **24**And they said to Joshua, "Truly the Lord has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away because of us."

#### *Section Overview*

This is the first narrative action encountered outside the Pentateuch. It comes as some surprise, then, that it is the narrative of two Israelite men given shelter in a foreign city by a Canaanite prostitute. Although sparingly told—or perhaps *because* it is sparingly told—the tiny drama has exercised a fascination out of all proportion to its size. Down through the centuries Jewish and Christian commentators alike have puzzled over its troubling details, and this continues to the present day. The bibliography of scholarship on Joshua 2 is very large, but questions over its interpretation persist.

<span id="page-336-0"></span>The burden of the commentary that follows here is, in large part, to open out the exegetical puzzles it contains, even if firm answers ultimately prove elusive. Why does Joshua send spies, and who are they? If they are "spies," why are they so quickly identified? What leads to their encounter with Rahab? How should Rahab's status and occupation be evaluated? Why should Rahab offer the spies shelter and protection? How should Christian readers regard the deception she perpetrates on their behalf? The questions continue. Of course, there is more we would like to know about the situation than can be determined from the details provided. But this is not a rare occurrence in studying biblical narrative. Two principles must be borne in mind. First, that small details may take on added significance because of the spare style of the biblical narrator; interpreters must read with attentive care, being careful also not to overinterpret. Second, the evangelical doctrine of inspiration regarding what has been provided by the Bible's inspired authors must also be applied to those reading in dependence on the Spirit.

<span id="page-337-6"></span><span id="page-337-1"></span>The story falls into two main sections, attending to the different phases of Rahab's activity resulting from contact with the Israelite spies, first in relation to her civic connections with the elite of Jericho (2:2–7) and second with the spies themselves in relation to Israel (vv. 8–21). This is framed by Joshua's commission of the spies as they go (v. 1) and his reception of them upon their return (vv. 22–24).

As a convention of Hebrew narration, storytellers prefer to have only two characters "on stage" at one time. In longer and more complex stories, observing this convention greatly assists analysis of the text's structure, and it helps here as well. The first pairing is Joshua and "the spies," who can be regarded as a single character in this narrative; they are never individuated. Rahab's interaction with various characters in Jericho shapes 2:2–7. A single pairing is seen also in the conversation recorded at length between Rahab and the spies in verses 8–21, and this section is structured by their to-and-fro exchange, which exhibits a degree of symmetry. Finally, the spies and Joshua are together again (vv. 22–24), with the mission apparently accomplished.

The narrative action is confined to a few verses; the vast majority of this narrative is carried by dialogue. Apart from the sending and return of the spies (cf. Section Outline, items 1 and 4), the plot is moved forward in only a few steps:

- <span id="page-337-2"></span>v. 4: Rahab hides the spies.
- <span id="page-337-3"></span>v. 6: She has hidden them on the roof with the flax.
- <span id="page-337-4"></span>v. 7: The men of Jericho pursue; the gates are shut.
- <span id="page-337-5"></span>v. 8: Rahab goes to the spies on the roof.
- <span id="page-337-7"></span>v. 15: Rahab engineers the spies' escape through the window of her house.
- <span id="page-337-8"></span>v. 21: The spies depart; Rahab fixes the cord.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-338-7"></span><span id="page-338-4"></span><span id="page-338-3"></span>2:1a This brief verse sets in motion a remarkable sequence of events; almost every element invites comment. The verse falls naturally into two halves: (1) Joshua's commission of the spies and their departure and (2) their arrival in the house of Rahab. Joshua 1 does not name the Israelites' location as the book begins. Even the context at the end of Deuteronomy provides little help, as Israel is depicted throughout that book as simply, and vaguely, in the "plains of Moab" (Deut. 34:1, 8). One must go back to Numbers 33:48–49 to get a sense of Israel's locale in the last stage of its wanderings; in that text Israel camps "by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab." And Shittim is the camp's site as this story begins. Alert readers of the books of Moses shudder at this name; it is where Israel "began to whore with the daughters of Moab" and so "yoked himself to Baal of Peor" (Num. 25:1, 3). This brought down God's wrath on the people and marked the end of the generation that left Egypt. Thus Shittim is an inauspicious setting for this first action by Israel after mourning the death of Moses.

<span id="page-338-6"></span><span id="page-338-2"></span><span id="page-338-1"></span><span id="page-338-0"></span>There is no comment on Joshua's decision to send out spies, but on reflection readers might be both prepared for and surprised by this move. Joshua was one of the twelve spies sent earlier by Moses into the land at the Lord's behest (Num. 13:1–16) and, with Caleb, one of the two faithful spies among that group (Num. 13:30; 14:6–10, 30). Given the divine instruction at that initial moment of entering the land, Joshua's decision to reprise that strategy at this time—now with only two spies required—makes good sense and perhaps simply makes use of the three days of preparation for breaking camp (Josh. 1:10–11). And yet, on this occasion there is no such divine instruction as there was for Moses, nor has Joshua sought the Lord's guidance regarding this decision—or at least none has been recorded, at any rate. However, given the Lord's commission to Joshua in chapter 1 to "arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them" (1:2), the more natural outcome would be simply to get up and go rather than delaying while awaiting the report of a scouting party. This is the first of two occasions in the book in which Joshua sends out spies, and for neither is there a divine mandate. The other occasion is before the battle with Ai (7:2–3), and on that occasion Joshua again neglects to seek God's guidance. In the first spy narrative a Canaanite household becomes (eventually) part of Israel, while in the second an Israelite household suffers the fate of the Canaanites. The implication seems to be that the spy strategy is not the Lord's optimal intention at this phase of Israel's life.

<span id="page-338-10"></span><span id="page-338-9"></span><span id="page-338-8"></span><span id="page-338-5"></span>2:1b Immediately the spies meet a Canaanite prostitute and lodge with her, and the warning notes of the Shittim connection sound more ominously. On this occasion the fears appear to be groundless, but that fact will emerge only as the story unfolds. The Hebrew text is unambiguous regarding Rahab's occupation: she is a *zona* (cf. 6:17, 22, 25), translated adequately as "prostitute" even though the <span id="page-339-6"></span>semantic nuance of the Hebrew term does not align precisely with the English. This is also how she is remembered in the NT (Gk. *pornē*, Heb. 11:31; James 2:25). Historical study has challenged what this label seems to entail.18 The suggestion is that such figures acted as innkeepers; their activities were regulated in ancient law codes, and these records help to fill out their social profile as being something different from, or at least more than, ones who offered sexual favors for a price. Such, too, is the characterization of Rahab in the retelling of the story by the Jewish historian Josephus (*Antiquities* 5.8). It is possible, then, that her moral character is not as dubious as the profile of a *zona* in the Hebrew Bible often implies (cf. Prov. 7:10–20; 23:27–28; symbolically Nah. 3:4).

<span id="page-339-5"></span><span id="page-339-1"></span>2:2–7 The circumstance is immediately brought to the attention of the king of Jericho. He is informed not only of the spies' whereabouts but also of the nature of their mission. This raises the question: what kind of spies are these? Again, care must be taken not to read the text anachronistically. These men seem to be on more of a reconnaissance job than some kind of espionage mission; perhaps "scouts" conveys better this sense. However secretive—or not—their mission might be, it is in their interests to avoid contact with the civic officials, of course, and to this end Rahab hides them (Josh. 2:4). Her motivation in doing so is not yet apparent but will be disclosed in the next movement of the plot. Here the pressing issue is the report and counsel she gives the king's messengers: in her encounter with the men she remained ignorant of their identity, they have already left the city, and the officials of Jericho should send a search party in hot pursuit (vv. 4–5).

<span id="page-339-3"></span><span id="page-339-2"></span>There is an irony and an issue to be faced in Rahab's report. The irony is that although she is blatantly lying—deceiving the king's messengers in order to protect the spies—her report is apparently taken at face value by the king's men and her advice followed. She seems, at least on this evidence, to be quite trustworthy, even if the story's readers are aware that the officials are being duped. On this basis, in terms of narrative art the reader may either form a favorable impression of Rahab's character or else judge the civic officials to be gullible and find some humor in the speed with which they set out based solely on Rahab's counsel and without any further investigation (v. 7). These options are not mutually exclusive!

<span id="page-339-4"></span><span id="page-339-0"></span>The issue runs deeper. Rahab has lied. This has troubled Christian commentators down the centuries. Both Augustine and his contemporary John Cassian reflected on Rahab's deceit in light of other biblical examples (e.g., the midwives in Exodus 1). For Augustine, the sin of lying remains sin, and the blessing that follows in Rahab's case comes from the benevolent action on behalf of the people of God, not the sin, which itself is forgiven. John Cassian likens the use of a lie to that of certain herbs that when consumed under the wrong conditions can be deadly but when applied to a disease will provide healing. So too the lie: it is to be used only in extremis. John Calvin has a third perspective, acknowledging that God is truth and so the lie is contrary to God's nature.

<sup>18</sup> Cf. D. J. Wiseman, "Rahab of Jericho," *TynBul* 14 (1964): 8–11.

And still the act of Rahab is not devoid of the praise of virtue, although it was not spotlessly pure. For it often happens that while the saints study to hold the right path, they deviate into circuitous courses. . . . By the kindness of God the fault is suppressed and not taken into account.19

<span id="page-340-12"></span><span id="page-340-11"></span><span id="page-340-10"></span><span id="page-340-9"></span><span id="page-340-0"></span>We can find other biblical parallels besides that of the midwives in Egypt. Jael's deception enables the destruction of Israel's enemy, and she is called the "most blessed of women" (Judg. 5:24; cf. 4:17–22)! Rebekah's ruse that elicits the blessing from Isaac is sometimes considered in these discussions (Genesis 27). Perhaps most striking is the case of 1 Kings 22, in which the Lord himself sends a "lying spirit" (1 Kings 22:22, 23) into the mouths of the prophets—a different scenario, then, but one in which God's purpose is worked out through human deception. All of this gives pause for thought and counsels against hasty judgments. We should at least be careful not to offer judgment where Scripture does not (cf. 2 Sam. 11:27). Oliver O'Donovan's full consideration of the "wrongs of falsehood" counsels this helpful formulation: "The benevolent lie must ultimately fail to be benevolent, though it may, in confronting acute hostility, make a pardonable mistake, showing good will to a victim in a way that fails to express the *root* of good will in God's gift of truth to mankind."20 Even if a lie leads to some good, deception is not ultimately a pointer to the God of truth.

<span id="page-340-7"></span><span id="page-340-5"></span><span id="page-340-3"></span><span id="page-340-2"></span>2:8–14 As the king's agents leave the city in their fruitless pursuit of the spies, the narrative brings into focus Rahab's interaction with these two Israelite men. The exchange on the roof (Josh. 2:8) is the first of two larger blocks of dialogue between Rahab and the spies. Rahab's address to the spies discloses her motivation in providing them shelter and safety at the risk of her own life (vv. 9–11), and it provides the basis for the request she will make of them (vv. 12–13). It is remarkable speech, as Frank Spina notes: "It is not even a stretch to say this woman might have been a strong applicant for a job teaching Israelite catechism. . . . [Her] confession is arguably the best one in the entire Book of Joshua, even better than anything offered by the great leader himself, Joshua."21 To appreciate its full character requires a patient and careful reading.

<span id="page-340-8"></span><span id="page-340-6"></span><span id="page-340-4"></span>2:9 Rahab's confession expresses a remarkable degree of confidence in the actions of Israel's covenant God: "I know that the Lord has given you the land." Of the six uses of the divine name in this chapter, four come from Rahab (vv. 9, 10, 11, 12; the other two are v. 14 by the spies and v. 24 by Joshua). These words of Rahab adopt the same starting point as the divine speech to Joshua in 1:2, already a notable signal of the orientation and insight of this Canaanite innkeeper. It also echoes the promises to the patriarchs; regardless of whether Rahab has intuited this or

learned of the divine promise in some other way, the claim remains a striking foundation for her continuing discourse.

Rahab's report, "The fear of you has fallen upon us, and . . . all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you," is likewise remarkable. In describing the dread that she feels in the face of the Israelite presence across the river she speaks not only for herself but for "all the inhabitants of the land." But how does she know this? Her knowledge here has puzzled many ancient commentators, Jewish and Christian alike, and they have offered various suggestions, some of which relate naturally to her role as an innkeeper, while some offer bawdier speculations based on her status as "prostitute." At a narrative level this claim at least resonates with the connection made between her and the emissaries of the king of Jericho as the chapter begins, including the level of trust they place in the information she provides to them (2:2–7). Clearly Rahab knows the talk not only of the town but of the regions beyond as well.

<span id="page-341-2"></span><span id="page-341-1"></span>It is not only the extent of Rahab's knowledge that is striking here but also the manner in which she frames her report of the widespread dread of Israel on account of the Lord's actions. She echoes the Song of Moses from Exodus 15:16, in which the distinctive language of "terror . . . falling upon" (a form of *naphal* "fall" + *ʿal* "upon" + *ʾemah*, "dread, horror") the enemies of Israel22 is the same as that used by Rahab here—the only two places in the Hebrew Bible this collocation occurs. So, as Rahab begins her plea to the agents of Israel, her speech resonates in striking ways with what has previously been heard from the God of Israel and from Moses, their late, lamented leader.

<span id="page-341-8"></span><span id="page-341-7"></span><span id="page-341-5"></span>2:10 Now Rahab identifies the source of Canaanite dread: the memory of the saving action of the Lord some forty years previously, when he "dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt." One might have expected the fear-inducing memory to be that of the plagues of Egypt that came with such devastation on Israel's oppressors, as they sometimes appear in biblical reminiscence apart from the deliverance at the Sea (e.g., Ps. 135:9). But this is not what Rahab offers at first; rather, it is the divine deliverance of Israel that is one source of Canaanite fear (cf. Ps. 77:19–20). And again Rahab's unexceptional wording invites closer inspection. The combination of "dried up" (a form of *yabash*) and the "Red Sea" (*yam suf*) occurs only twice in the entire Hebrew Bible: here and again in the mouth of Joshua as he explains to the people of Israel the significance of their crossing the Jordan River, the waters of which had likewise been "dried up" by the Lord as those of the Red Sea had been (Josh. 4:23). So rather than being simply an innocuous reference to the deliverance of the "wilderness generation" of Israel from Egypt, Rahab's wording here anticipates the formulation of Israel's current leader at the moment the "conquest generation" experiences its parallel action of God. And to the divine promise (2:9) Rahab adds divine deliverance (v. 10).

<span id="page-341-6"></span><span id="page-341-4"></span><span id="page-341-3"></span><span id="page-341-0"></span><sup>22</sup> In that instance Edom, Moab, and "all the inhabitants of Canaan" (Ex. 15:15).

<span id="page-342-1"></span><span id="page-342-0"></span>The nation enjoyed divinely mandated and aided military victories in the wilderness as well, and Rahab adds these to the Red Sea crossing ("What you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og") as the sum of that which induces Canaanite dread. These hostile Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, refused Israel safe passage through their territories and instead massed their armies to engage Israel in battle. They were defeated (Num. 21:21–24, 33–35). These two kings as a set pair become the template for what will take place in the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, especially in chapters 9–13, and Moses invokes them in this way in one of the key passages commissioning Joshua as his successor (Deut. 31:4). In effect, all of Israel's battles are defensive: opposition arises as dread of the people falls on the lands they approach, leading to aggressive hostility (cf. Psalm 2!) rather than a recognition of the sovereignty of Israel's God and submission to him—as with Rahab here.23

<span id="page-342-13"></span><span id="page-342-10"></span><span id="page-342-7"></span><span id="page-342-5"></span>Joshua 2:10 concludes on an ominous note. Rahab characterizes the defeat of Sihon and Og as their having been "devoted to destruction." She uses the verbal form of the word *kherem*, the distinctive technical term for the total ritual annihilation of the enemy. This is the first occurrence of the term in the book. The *kherem* has proved to be a notoriously difficult ethical issue for readers across the centuries; it will be considered more fully in connection with the story of Jericho in Joshua 6–7 (cf. comments there; cf. Deut. 7:2).

<span id="page-342-8"></span><span id="page-342-6"></span><span id="page-342-4"></span>2:11 After the pivotal trigger for Canaanite fear is set out in verse 10, Rahab in verse 11a reiterates the depths to which the people of the land have come in terms akin to those of verse 9. She not only reinforces but deepens and extends the impression of that earlier verse: "There was no spirit left in any man because of you." They literally were individually breathless on account of Israel's presence.

<span id="page-342-9"></span>While the Canaanites' attention is focused on the dread-inducing Israelites corresponding to their actions against Sihon and Og—Rahab offers her own quite different perception in verse 11b: "For the Lord your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath." Among all of Rahab's confession this statement is most remarkable of all. Where has she learned her theology? This precise wording is found on only two other occasions in the OT.24 The first is at the climactic moment in the sermon of Moses: his forceful appeal to Israel to be faithful to this God and obey his commands. Moses offers this as the corollary of the historical experience recounted in Deuteronomy 1–3, displaying the unique, unparalleled character of *this* God on Israel's behalf, who is "in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other" (Deut. 4:39) The second occurrence of this confession comes at an equally dramatic and significant moment in Israel's history. On that occasion it is spoken by Solomon as he uses this phrase as the preface to his great prayer at the dedication of the temple: "O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like

<span id="page-342-12"></span><span id="page-342-11"></span><span id="page-342-3"></span><span id="page-342-2"></span><sup>23</sup> There is a further echo of this perception in the ruse of the Gibeonites in Joshua 9:9–10 (cf. comment on 9:8–13).

<sup>24</sup> Cf. Douglas S. Earl, *Reading Joshua as Christian Scripture,* JTISup 2 (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2010), 126–127.

<span id="page-343-9"></span>you, in heaven above or on [the] earth beneath" (1 Kings 8:23). So Rahab's statement of the supremacy of the God of Israel and the basis for her plea to the spies match that of Moses' reflecting on the work of God in delivering Israel from Egypt and anticipate that of King Solomon as he dedicates the temple in Jerusalem, the place that marks the presence of God with his people.

Each of the elements, then, of Rahab's confession in these verses contains surprises, and her reaction to these truths is to make every effort to ensure that she too is included among the people of this God and that she experiences the deliverance only this God can bring—which means her orientation and ultimate loyalties are entirely opposite to that of the rest of the Canaanite population.

<span id="page-343-3"></span><span id="page-343-1"></span><span id="page-343-0"></span>2:12–14 Having thus declared her convictions concerning the God of Israel and accounted for the state of the Canaanite population, Rahab now makes her request, following through to the moral conclusion of her preceding speech. And the theological surprises continue. Her plea to the spies is framed in terms of the way she has "dealt kindly" with them, and it aligns her hopes for their response to her in the same terms: the Hebrew here uses the freighted term *hesed*, which is difficult to translate but signals a kindly and loyal love and faithfulness, whether between people (e.g., Gen. 24:49; Prov. 3:3) or from God to his human creatures (e.g., Deut. 5:10; Lam. 3:22–32), particularly in his covenant love for his people (e.g., Psalm 136). There are other ways in which Rahab might have framed this request, but her stating her actions in terms of *hesed* and seeking a corresponding response from Israel's agents sets off deep resonances. Her plea is essentially for salvation (Joshua 2:13), including a "sure sign" (cf. comment on 2:15–21) not only for herself but also for her "father's house" (v. 12), as enumerated in verse 13. The spies respond affirmatively, adopting the term used by Rahab: as long as she keeps quiet about their affairs, they will also deal with her "kindly [*hesed*] and faithfully." These are the only occurrences of the term *hesed* in the book, and its use is initiated by Rahab.

<span id="page-343-10"></span><span id="page-343-5"></span><span id="page-343-4"></span><span id="page-343-2"></span>2:15–21 The second block of dialogue between Rahab and the spies reverses the initiative in the conversation and places it in a more liminal setting. As the narrative has it, this phase of the dialogue unfolds as the men are dangling from a rope in Rahab's window at the city's wall (v. 15). Even if the men take the initiative in speech, then, they remain dependent on Rahab for their welfare. Her counsel to them on how to evade the pursuit of the men of Jericho (v. 16) is taken at face value (v. 22) and again attests to Rahab's trustworthiness.

<span id="page-343-8"></span><span id="page-343-7"></span><span id="page-343-6"></span>The spies' reply in verses 17–20 is by far their longest speech in the text. Aside from the agreement that will see Rahab's family safe so long as it remains within her house, it is the sign of "this scarlet cord" (lit., "cord of scarlet thread"; three Hebrew words, *tiqwat hut hashani* ) that they supply to her (where did it come from?) that has drawn attention over the centuries of commentary. In Christian commentary the scarlet thread has been identified with the blood of Christ from as early as *1 Clement* 12:7 ("a scarlet thread . . . foreshadowing that all who believe and hope on God shall have redemption through the blood of the Lord"), followed by Origen

(c*.* 185– 254) among many others, up through Charles Spurgeon (1834–1892). The association with the blood applied to the doorways of the homes of the Israelites during the first Passover in Egypt (Ex. 12:13) has also been made.25

<span id="page-344-1"></span><span id="page-344-0"></span>To most modern readers, such suggestions appear arbitrary and without foundation in the text. Rabbinic commentators, for example, could likewise make connections to the scarlet threads for the tabernacle (the suggestion of the eighteenth-century commentator Metzudat David; cf. Ex. 25:4) or the "thread" of descendants of Rahab that tradition has assigned to her.26 While free associations such as these that spring to the mind of the preacher—whether Christian or Jewish—from a small textual detail have a naïve appeal, they remain speculative and indicative more of the imagination of the interpreter than of the impulse of the biblical writer. But the detail of the "scarlet thread" was preserved by this inspired storyteller: a bit of insignificant stuff, conveying a sign of saving significance. So perhaps more hangs from this thread, then, than the fate of Rahab's family alone.

<span id="page-344-5"></span><span id="page-344-4"></span>With Rahab's agreement to the spies' conditions, the business is concluded (Josh. 2:21a). Even in this final moment Rahab's initiative is hinted at, as she "sent" the spies away (v. 21b), much as Joshua "sent" them on their mission at the beginning of the episode (v. 1).

<span id="page-344-7"></span><span id="page-344-6"></span><span id="page-344-3"></span><span id="page-344-2"></span>2:22–24 Events unfold just as Rahab has predicted they would (cf. v. 16). The spies return safely to the Israelite camp and report to Joshua. It is tempting to see something of an ironic undertone to the Hebrew wording of the last clause of verse 23 ("all that had happened to them"), which could be rendered "all that found them." They seem to have been a remarkably passive pair of spies!

<span id="page-344-8"></span>Their final report, as given in verse 24, confirms the divine gifting of the land and passes along the psychological information gleaned from Rahab. There is nothing here, however, about the geographical setting of the city in the terrain, an assessment of its fortifications, an estimate of Jericho's fighting force, or so on. So, in the final analysis, what did the spies accomplish? By implication—there is no explicit statement—Joshua is satisfied with their mission. He will, as it happens, adopt this approach on one further occasion (cf. comments on 7:1–26). For the moment, however, it might feel like something of an anticlimax, at least so far as Israelite military preparations are concerned.

#### <span id="page-344-10"></span>*Response*

At least three things are going on in this text. First, the frame has to do with the interests of Israel and the leadership of Joshua. At this time and from this vantage point there is nothing suspect about Joshua's dispatch of the two spies to Jericho, although how it relates to his own solo effort related in 5:13–15 is difficult to say. At least it appears that Joshua is attempting to exercise prudence in discerning

<span id="page-345-0"></span>the lay of the land. If the spies' theological insight corresponds with the kind of information Joshua sought, this would be consistent with the exercise of faith that Joshua's own spying in partnership with Caleb brought many years earlier. The response they offered to a fearful people on that occasion ("If the Lord delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us"; Num. 14:8) orients the hopes and expectations of Israel toward what God is willing and able to do through a faithful and obedient people rather than toward their own strength or stratagem. And such is also the outcome here.

<span id="page-345-4"></span><span id="page-345-2"></span>The narrative may be anticlimactic on a military or strategic level, but it is satisfying on a theological level, and this is especially true of the second facet of the story, which concerns Rahab.27 Over the centuries her actions have been reflected upon with profit and from different angles. In rabbinic commentary Rahab's *zeal* seems to come to the fore. She acts boldly and shrewdly on Israel's behalf as she clearly identifies her future with the acts of Israel's God. In patristic commentary it is rather her *faith* that claims attention. Having realized that Israel's God is "in the heavens above and on the earth beneath" (Josh. 2:11), she commits her future to this God and his people. Her story, then, is one of conversion. It is not completed here, and even by the end of chapter 6 she is not fully integrated into Israel. Still, the decision is made, the trajectory certain. There is no need, of course, to choose between these two interpretive emphases. Rahab's is a story of faith in action, as recognized in James 2:25. "She is certainly an example of the Divine grace working through a sinful people."28 In the Gospel of Matthew her story is woven into the genealogy of Jesus (Matt. 1:5), one of four women to appear there, alongside Tamar, Ruth, and Bathsheba. If Rahab could grasp and act upon the signs that Israel's God is supreme and thus enter into a covenant relationship with Israel's representatives (Josh. 2:12), the same possibility is true of any Canaanite.

<span id="page-345-7"></span><span id="page-345-6"></span><span id="page-345-3"></span><span id="page-345-1"></span>The third perspective in the text points a different direction. Not much narrative effort is expended on the inhabitants of Jericho themselves or their king (only vv. 2–7, 22). Although limited in scope, these verses are decisive in their depiction of a king and people who resolutely set their face against Israel and its God—quite the opposite of Rahab. Their entrenched opposition will lead to their own destruction. In this text the initial outcomes are the futility of their investigations—their judgment impaired, they readily accept without scrutiny Rahab's misdirection—and the futility of their pursuit. These both anticipate the futility of their defenses. The gate is closed, the city sealed, but these will prove no obstacle to the God who parted the Red Sea and consigned Amorite kings to oblivion. And yet Jericho has time to think and reconsider. When the city is next seen, however, nothing will have changed (6:1).

3 Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from Shittim. And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. **2**At the end of three days the officers went through the camp **<sup>3</sup>** and commanded the people, "As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it. **4**Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits*<sup>1</sup>* in length. Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before." **5**Then Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you." **6**And Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.

**<sup>7</sup>**The Lord said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. **8**And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.' " **9**And Joshua said to the people of Israel, "Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God." **10**And Joshua said, "Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. **<sup>11</sup>**Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth*<sup>2</sup>* is passing over before you into the Jordan. **12**Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man. **13**And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap."

**<sup>14</sup>** So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, **<sup>15</sup>** and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), **<sup>16</sup>** the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho. **17**Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.

4 When all the nation had finished passing over the Jordan, the Lord said to Joshua, **<sup>2</sup>** "Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man, **<sup>3</sup>** and command them, saying, 'Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests' feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.' " **4**Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe. **5**And Joshua said to them, "Pass on before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, **<sup>6</sup>** that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, 'What do those stones mean to you?' **<sup>7</sup>** then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever."

**<sup>8</sup>**And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the Lord told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down*<sup>3</sup>* there. **9**And Joshua set up*<sup>4</sup>* twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day. **10**For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua.

The people passed over in haste. **11**And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the Lord and the priests passed over before the people. **12**The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them. **13**About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the Lord for battle, to the plains of Jericho. **14**On that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.

**<sup>15</sup>**And the Lord said to Joshua, **<sup>16</sup>** "Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan." **<sup>17</sup>** So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan." **18**And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.

**<sup>19</sup>**The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. **20**And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal. **21**And he said to the people of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in times to come, 'What do these stones mean?' **<sup>22</sup>** then you shall let your children know, 'Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.' **<sup>23</sup>**For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over, **<sup>24</sup>** so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty, that you may fear the Lord your God forever."*<sup>5</sup>*

#### *Section Overview*

After the compact drama in the previous chapter featuring Rahab, this next episode can feel congested and even confusing to the reader, in spite of its own drama and significance. At several points in the book of Joshua parallels are drawn between the events of the exodus, when the previous generation departed Egypt under Moses' leadership, and the present generation's experience in entering Canaan. Of these moments, the crossing of the Jordan River on "dry ground" is certainly the most obvious—it is, in any case, noted explicitly at Joshua 4:22—and probably the most significant. At that fundamental level, then, things are clear enough.

<span id="page-348-5"></span><span id="page-348-3"></span><span id="page-348-2"></span><span id="page-348-1"></span>The narration of this momentous event, however, is beset with difficulties and challenges to the reader. As the episode begins, it is difficult to know how its timing relates to the conference between Joshua and the spies that concluded chapter 2 or whether it harks back more directly to the arrangements made in chapter 1. A generous measure of direct speech can be seen in chapters 3–4, but it is almost wholly in the form of command or instruction, and that without reply. There is nothing like dialogue in the story in spite of the amount of speaking it contains. The priests with the ark form a unified group distinct from the rest of the people, who form a second group. The actions of these two groups are difficult to keep clear, including even their spatial relation to each other. And then there is the crossing—or "passing over," in the preferred language of the narrator—itself.29 The people seem to "pass over" twice, once in 3:17–4:1 and again at 4:10–11. Then there is the matter of the memorial stones, which seem to be erected two or three times and explained twice.

<span id="page-348-4"></span>Inevitably, some scholars have resolved the difficulties raised by these features, along with other details, by positing a complex editorial process that can be disentangled and assigned to distinct sources. However, this rough literary texture is so obvious that it seems likely to serve the narrator's purpose to present the episode in this fashion rather than via some smoother account. There is further support for such an approach when we notice that the accounts in chapters 3–4 take up distinctive vantage points, bring different concerns to the foreground, and offer complementary perspectives on the momentous event. Commentators have helpfully suggested the analogy of the artistic choices made by a film director to display various facets of some cinematic moment; the ancient Hebrew narrator merely lacked the technical options available to the filmmaker to convey these multifaceted dimensions.

In broad terms, then, chapter 3 might be called the riverbed perspective; its chief concern is with the mechanics of the river crossing itself and its meaning for Joshua. Chapter 4, on the other hand, pays no attention to the flow of water (or its absence) but rather is concerned with the memorialization of the event and its larger meaning for the people of Israel and the watching nations. Yet the narrator ensures that each episode has a hook in the other: the odd and intrusive notice

<span id="page-348-0"></span><sup>29</sup> The Hebrew verb used here is *ʿabar* (a very common verb, used almost seven hundred times in the Hebrew Bible); its translation as "pass over" should not be confused with the verb used of the Passover in Exodus 12:13, 23, 27, which is *pasah*.

<span id="page-349-7"></span><span id="page-349-6"></span><span id="page-349-5"></span><span id="page-349-4"></span><span id="page-349-3"></span><span id="page-349-1"></span>about choosing twelve men in 3:12 anticipates the selection of the stone carriers in 4:2, while the notice of 4:14 of the exaltation of Joshua has its counterpart in 3:7. The narrative dynamic of the account as a whole thus comes clear. The preparations for the crossing (vv. 1–6) lead up to the focus on Joshua's leadership at this crucial phase of operations (vv. 7–13), and the "passing over" takes place via the miracle of the cessation of the water's flow, which is integral to the story (vv. 14–17). In that crossing—emphasized by the repetition at 3:17 and 4:1—twelve memorial stones are collected and explained, first with primary reference to the people as a whole (4:1–13) and then again with a priestly emphasis and an interest in the nations (vv. 15–24). It is difficult to see how a narrator using the tools of ancient Hebrew prose could convey such a multifaceted account in so integrated a fashion yet eliminate the clumsiness perceived by many modern commentators.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-349-2"></span><span id="page-349-0"></span>3:1 The notice that "Joshua rose early in the morning" (v. 1)—coincident, it seems, with the "three days" timing (v. 2)—raises again the question of the relationship

<span id="page-350-13"></span><span id="page-350-2"></span><span id="page-350-1"></span><span id="page-350-0"></span>of this activity to the narrative of Rahab in chapter 2. The formula "and . . . rose early in the morning" (Hb. *wayashkem* . . . *baboqer*) is found a further eleven times in Hebrew narrative, including three in Joshua. On each of those occasions the formula signals action directly consequent of some instruction, usually divine.30 The case of Abraham in Genesis 19:27 is instructive for this instance in Joshua, as it is separated from its precursor text (Gen. 18:33) by the dramatic events in Sodom (19:1–26). This consistent pattern strongly suggests that the activity that now unfolds in preparation for crossing the Jordan links back directly to Joshua 1, with the Rahab story fitting integrally into this sequence rather than being sequential with it. Readers are invited to understand that the "end of three days" in verse 2, when the officers act on Joshua's instructions of 1:10–11, is coincident with the arrival of the spies and their conference with Joshua—even if this chronology seems awkward to modern readers.

<span id="page-350-16"></span><span id="page-350-14"></span><span id="page-350-12"></span><span id="page-350-10"></span>The time has finally come to depart from Shittim (cf. 2:1; modern Juwafat al-Kafrayn, Jordan), roughly 5 miles (8 km) from the Jordan River and opposite Jericho, another 10 miles (16 km) to the west.

<span id="page-350-17"></span><span id="page-350-11"></span>3:2–4 The action now unfolds with deliberate reference back to chapter 1. The "officers" (cf. comment on 1:10) move into action, delivering an update on the instructions given three days previously.

<span id="page-350-19"></span><span id="page-350-15"></span><span id="page-350-9"></span><span id="page-350-5"></span>The ark is swiftly introduced along with its bearers, the priests. The ark will serve as the guide to the people in their crossing; it is a central "character" in the narrative of the Jordan crossing, mentioned seventeen times in Joshua 3–4. This pervasive presence of the ark is striking in view of its otherwise limited appearance in the book. Aside from two brief, incidental references (7:6; 8:33), it is prominent again only in the fall of Jericho in chapter 6. Given the ark's role as a guide to the people, an inviting parallel emerges with the fire and cloud in the exodus from Egypt, which provided divine direction for the Israelites from the moment they departed Egypt as they made their way through the wilderness (Ex. 13:21–22; cf. Deut. 1:33). The fire and cloud protected them from their Egyptian enemies (Ex. 14:24), and signaled God's presence with them in association with the tabernacle on their journeys (cf. Ex. 40:36–38). At some point, though, this guidance by fire and cloud ceased. Whereas these had guided the people earlier, now the ark takes over the guidance function at this crossing, which forms a counterpart to the episode at the Red Sea.31 And just as the fire and cloud miraculously delivered the people as they left Egypt, so too the ark will be present at the miraculous entrance to the Land of Promise at Jericho in Joshua 6, so fulfilling the protection function. And clearly it becomes the focal point for God's presence in the books of Samuel– Kings, latterly in association with the temple.

<span id="page-350-18"></span><span id="page-350-7"></span><span id="page-350-6"></span><span id="page-350-4"></span><span id="page-350-3"></span><sup>30</sup> The other instances are Genesis 19:27; 20:8; 21:14; 22:3; 28:18; 31:55 [32:1 MT]; Exodus 24:4; Joshua 6:12; 7:16; 8:10; and 1 Samuel 17:20. The only exceptions involve Laban in Genesis 31:55 (no instruction) and David in 1 Samuel 17:20 (the instruction is from Jesse). In all eleven of these passages, however, the action signaled by the "rising" occurs the very next day.

<span id="page-350-8"></span><sup>31</sup> The conjunction of God's direct presence in the cloud together with the ark is found in the account of Numbers 10:33–36, supporting the parallel suggested here.

<span id="page-351-7"></span>With the people now in the land, the ark takes the place of the fire and cloud of the wilderness. But there is a difference between these modes of guidance. The fire and cloud were, in a sense, unmediated. They required no human assistance. This is not the case for the ark—for the most part! (cf. comment on 4:15–18) which requires some intervention for transport. With an object so holy, however, only priests can function as its bearers. When arrangements were made for the transport of the camp in the wilderness, Aaron and his sons covered the ark, and the Kohathites—one branch of the tribe of Levi—were assigned to carry it, but they were prohibited from touching it (Num. 4:5, 15; recalled in Deut. 10:8; 31:9). In fact, apart from the assignment of cities in Joshua 21:19, interest in priests as a class in the book of Joshua is limited to the two occasions on which they bear the ark: at the crossing of the Jordan and the taking of Jericho.32

<span id="page-351-10"></span><span id="page-351-8"></span><span id="page-351-4"></span><span id="page-351-0"></span>The final instruction conveyed by the officers—to keep "about 2,000 cubits in length," or over one-half mile (0.8 km)—has interpretive difficulties of its own.33 The Jordan is not very wide at this point, nor are the banks very steep. It is difficult to know how maintaining such a gap to the ark would aid with direction, which is the rationale provided. But the instruction has other echoes. The wording "do not come near" appears only three times in the Bible, and two of those are here and in the scene of Moses at the burning bush (Ex. 3:5). Although the bush scene has a stronger resonance still to come (Josh. 5:13–15), this explicit echo is a reminder of the ark's sacrosanct status. We also find similar instruction when Israel is camped at the foot of Mount Sinai in Exodus 19, although there it is a matter of strict demarcation of Israel from the mountain, rather than of keeping a given distance from it. Even if directional sense is meant to be enhanced by the people's keeping so far from the ark, these other resonances inform both Israel's sense and the reader's that the ark requires the utmost respect.

<span id="page-351-6"></span><span id="page-351-3"></span><span id="page-351-2"></span><span id="page-351-1"></span>3:5 If the instructions conveyed by the officers contains a faint echo of the preparations at the foot of Mount Sinai in Exodus 19, the command from Joshua amplifies it. In the preparation at the mountain of God in Exodus 19:10 Moses instructed the people similarly to consecrate themselves in anticipation of the Lord's coming to the mountain (Ex. 19:9). In that case, two days of preparation were provided. Another incident in the wilderness wanderings has an even stronger resonance, and closer verbal parallel: the provision of quail in response to the people's demand for meat in Numbers 11:18. Woven into that account is the appointment of seventy elders and the distribution of the Spirit on them to assist Moses in governing Israel. The motif of consecration "for tomorrow," then, reinforces the expectation of divine intervention as announced in the "wonders" predicted by Joshua (cf. 7:13). This can be seen as a fulfillment of the promise the Lord made to Moses at the renewal of the covenant following the golden calf episode, still at Mount Sinai (Ex.

<span id="page-351-9"></span><span id="page-351-5"></span><sup>32</sup> Eleazar son of Aaron, as well as his son Phinehas, appear in Joshua, but they act as individuals rather than in a priestly capacity.

<span id="page-351-11"></span><sup>33</sup> The distance conversion assumes a cubit of 18 inches (45 cm), so 0.56 miles (0.90 km) miles is the distance specified. In later Judaism 2,000 cubits was the distance of a "Sabbath day's journey" (Acts 1:12).

<span id="page-352-0"></span>34:10), as the "marvels" (Hb. *niflaʾot*) announced by God find their counterpart in the "wonders" (*niflaʾot*) Joshua announces here.

<span id="page-352-5"></span><span id="page-352-4"></span>3:6 Although the instructions of the officers in Joshua 3:5 relate to "tomorrow," the command Joshua now gives to the priests—to "take up the ark" and "pass on before the people"—seems temporally awkward. The reader is to assume either that, unsignaled, this is now the next day or that the priests go out in advance of the people, who remain in place for a few more hours. Given the hints in the remainder of chapter 3 ("today," v. 7; the coincident action in v. 14), the former is the more likely scenario. In a narrative so taut and compressed as this account of the Jordan crossing, such abrupt transitions may be expected.

<span id="page-352-6"></span><span id="page-352-3"></span>A subtle but meaningful contrast can be seen between Joshua's brief words to the people in verse 5 and this instruction to the priests. In the previous verse, and on the previous day, the last phase of preparation is put in place in anticipation of what will come. With the instruction in verse 6a, complete with its word-for-word fulfillment in verse 6b, the moment of decisive action has finally come. As Soggin points out, "When the ark is taken up and carried, God begins to act. That this in no way means that it is possible to make Yahweh do what is required of him by ritual means, is something Israel was to learn at its cost, cf. I Sam. 4."34

<span id="page-352-12"></span><span id="page-352-7"></span><span id="page-352-2"></span><span id="page-352-1"></span>3:7–8 With the ark now in motion and, in some profound but mysterious sense, with God on the move, the Lord addresses Joshua. This caps a crescendo of authority, as the reader has "heard" the voices of the officers, the voice of Joshua, and now the voice of the Lord. The reassurance God gives Joshua here reinforces the promise of divine presence given in 1:5, when God formerly spoke to Joshua, providing a further connection between this episode and that of chapter 1. The promise here is extended, as not only must Joshua know that God is with him but Israel as a whole must see that the leadership mediated by Moses continues intact in Joshua. The promise thus serves as a reassurance not only to Joshua but by extension also to the whole people of God.

<span id="page-352-8"></span>The divine instruction in 3:8 concerning the movement of the priests with the ark not only gives guidance concerning their actions but also provides explicit confirmation that the ark's movement as carried by the priests has divine sanction. By this action, and signaled by the presence of the ark, God will act at the Jordan on behalf of those entering the land with the same power demonstrated at the Rea Sea to those who left Egypt.

<span id="page-352-10"></span><span id="page-352-9"></span>3:9–13 As Joshua summons the people to draw near, his words take on prophetic overtones as he speaks on behalf of the Lord (v. 9). He issues the final instructions before the people embark on the crossing itself, and, as has so often been the case already in this book, the directions come with encouragements. A miracle is announced (v. 13), but this startling and significant statement is not the primary focus; rather, Joshua is concerned first to ensure that the people understand that

this event discloses the character of their God and the meaning of his presence among them.

<span id="page-353-9"></span><span id="page-353-8"></span><span id="page-353-4"></span><span id="page-353-0"></span>Two titles are used, one each in verses 10 and 11, that set apart the God of Israel as distinct from the pretensions of any potential rival. Although their wording is familiar, they are not so pervasive in the OT as we might assume. In verse 10 Joshua informs Israel how they will know "that the *living God* is among you." The precise wording used here for "living God" (Hb. *ʾel hay*) occurs at only three other places in the OT: in two of the psalms of the Sons of Korah (Pss. 42:2; 84:2) and in Hosea 1:10. At a further nine places a close variant is found (*ʾelohim hay*, 2 Kings 19:4, 16//Isa. 37:4, 17; *ʾelohim hayyim,* Deut. 5:26; 1 Sam. 17:26, 36; Jer. 10:10; 23:36). Taken together, the passages using this title outline a theology of divine presence (Deut. 5:26; Pss. 42:2; 84:2) and the dignity and incomparability of this God against the presumptions of hostile nations (1 Sam. 17:26, 36; 2 Kings 19:4, 16; Isa. 37:4, 17). Joshua's use of the title stands at the intersection of these two main themes connected with referring to the God of Israel as the "*living* God."

<span id="page-353-11"></span><span id="page-353-10"></span><span id="page-353-7"></span>The second title, "Lord of all the earth" (*ʾadon kol-haʾarets*), appears in verses 11 and 13. Here again the phrase occurs with less frequency than might be supposed: it is found only in the two verses here and again at Psalm 97:5; Micah 4:13; and Zechariah 4:14; 6:5. In the psalm and Micah it is used in parallel with the divine name, Yahweh, in the context of theophany and military victory, respectively. In such settings a universalistic sense for *ʾerets*—which may be translated as either "land" or "earth" (or, we might say, "world")—makes good sense. Here in Joshua that might seem more difficult if the reference is to the Promised Land in a more limited sense. But if Rahab is able to confess that the Lord the God of Israel reigns over heaven and earth (*ʾerets*; Josh. 2:11), so too this larger claim may be seen in this title, especially with its qualification by "all."

<span id="page-353-6"></span><span id="page-353-5"></span><span id="page-353-3"></span><span id="page-353-2"></span><span id="page-353-1"></span>Such is the character of the God who is about to act on behalf of Israel. It is fitting that Joshua should signal this theology at just this moment, as he announces an imminent act of God (3:13) that will serve as the guarantee of God's immediate presence as well as his capacity to dispossess the nations before Israel (v. 10). There are, then, two parts to Joshua's prophetic statement, which entails three temporal phases: (1) "now" (v. 11) and (2) "later" (v. 10) served by the (3) "very soon" (v. 13). The seven-member list of nations holds its own interest. Such a list occurs roughly fifteen times, with five each coming in Exodus and Joshua, the other instances being scattered. But on only two further occasions is it a seven-member list, as here: Deuteronomy 7:1, where it accompanies the prospective instruction concerning the *kherem* (cf. comment on Josh. 2:10), and Joshua 24:11, where it is found again in Joshua's prophetic retrospective of God's faithfulness in all that has been accomplished in bringing them into the Promised Land. The certainty of God's dispossessing (or "driving out"—the expression does not require the sense of "exterminate") these nations is founded upon the action he is about to undertake in preventing the waters of the Jordan from flowing (3:13). The cessation of the

water is a consequence of his presence, as identified with the ark of the covenant; the "feet of the priests" are incidental to the miracle.

<span id="page-354-11"></span><span id="page-354-2"></span>This tightly-woven sequence brackets the instructions of verse 12 to select twelve men, one from each of Israel's twelve tribes, which is left without explanation. Their actions are integral to Israel's crossing the Jordan seen as a whole and will feature prominently in chapter 4. Here their selection is integrated into the final moments of preparation. Their duty is no afterthought; rather, their role is deliberate, even if at this point their function remains obscure.

<span id="page-354-8"></span><span id="page-354-7"></span><span id="page-354-6"></span><span id="page-354-5"></span><span id="page-354-4"></span><span id="page-354-1"></span><span id="page-354-0"></span>3:14–17 Aside from the arrangement of the march in verse 6, everything up to this point has been either instruction or preparation. Now there is action—and according to the Hebrew syntax everything happens at once. We find two sets of coordinated activity in verses 14–16, bracketed by mention of the "people." First, as the people set out, the ark-bearing priests go before (v. 14); second, as the feet of the ark-bearing priests touch the edge of the water (v. 15a MT), the waters of the Jordan stop flowing (v. 16). The note about the Jordan's seasonal flooding (v. 15b MT) is "offline" in terms of the Hebrew syntax and could be represented in parentheses in translation. This tightly knit scene has its culmination in the second mention of the "people" (v. 16). They cross over "opposite Jericho," the mention of the city recalling the reconnaissance in chapter 2 and anticipating the advance of chapter 6. The topographical details included have been scrutinized by commentators in an attempt to explain the miraculous cessation of the river's flow, especially since in contemporary experience crossing the Jordan does not seem so difficult.35 The additional details of 3:16 describe an extent of some miles, from a named point "far away" upstream to the Dead Sea, the destination of the water's flow downstream an impressive stretch of dry riverbed. The repetition of details from verse 13 in verse 16 signals the primary intention: to reinforce the perception of the drying up of the Jordan's flow as a result of divine intervention. Further reinforcement comes in verse 17, which in Hebrew uses the identical first word as verse 16: the verb "stand." While in verse 16 it is the flowing waters of the Jordan that "stand," in verse 17 it is the ark-bearing priests who "stand." Where the Lord's ark stands, there the waters must do likewise.

<span id="page-354-9"></span><span id="page-354-3"></span>The result is "dry ground" shared by priests as they stand and the people as they cross over, repeated for emphasis in verse 17. In similar fashion the reiteration of the word "all" (Hb. *kol*; "all Israel," "all the nation") makes abundantly clear the inclusive and complete nature of the event.

<span id="page-354-12"></span><span id="page-354-10"></span>4:1a The most striking repetition, however, is the use in the Masoretic Text of the last seven words of 3:17 as the first seven words of chapter 4, now introduced by the narratival Hebrew verb *wayhi* (= "so it was that") in combination with the relative particle connected to a different preposition (yielding "when" rather than "until"). Given the narrative sequence that follows concerning the collection of the

<sup>35</sup> Cf. Christiana Z. Peppard, "Troubling Waters: The Jordan River between Religious Imagination and Environmental Degradation," *JESS* 3/2 (2013): 109–119.

memorial stones, this could leave the impression that this activity takes places only after the crossing, with the twelve designated carriers returning to collect their stones. That this is not what is in mind, but rather concurrent action is signaled by the unusual division in the Hebrew text of this verse, which places a paragraph marker after the repeated words and before the introduction of the Lord's speech.

<span id="page-355-14"></span><span id="page-355-13"></span><span id="page-355-12"></span><span id="page-355-11"></span><span id="page-355-10"></span><span id="page-355-3"></span>4:1b–3 The Lord speaks again to Joshua to carry forward the instructions begun in 3:7–8 and passed along to the people in the central paragraph of that chapter. There Joshua summoned twelve men as tribal representatives (3:12) but did not clarify what their task was to be. Now the Lord repeats that instruction (4:2) and calls them to take one stone each from the riverbed and bear the stones to the new camp, on the west bank of the Jordan (v. 3). No action corresponds to this in the Red Sea crossing, although we find something like it at the conclusion to the reception of the law at Mount Sinai (Ex. 24:4). Unlike the "pillars" (Hb. *matsebah*) set up at the conclusion of the law giving on Sinai, however, these are simple "stones" (*ʾeben*). Although pillars appear to have been an acceptable part of patriarchal devotion (e.g., Gen. 28:18, 22; 35:14; cf. Isa. 19:19) and were erected by Moses at Sinai, they came to be regarded as illicit (Lev. 26:1; Deut. 16:22) and appear later only in association with idolatry (e.g., 1 Kings 14:23 [of Judah]; 2 Kings 17:10 [of Israel]; cf. Hos. 10:1–2). Here the collected "stones" avoid any such associations. Presumably they are of a modest size, too, since each can be carried by a single individual (Josh. 3:5).

<span id="page-355-18"></span><span id="page-355-17"></span><span id="page-355-15"></span><span id="page-355-9"></span><span id="page-355-4"></span><span id="page-355-0"></span>4:4–7 As Joshua conveys the Lord's command to the twelve men, the bare instructions he has received begin to be filled with meaning. First, what might have been assumed even from 3:12 concerning their selection is made explicit: the men, and the stones they have taken up, are tribal representatives and so in that sense stand for the people of Israel as a whole. This goes beyond the mere political representation of the twelve spies of Numbers 13:4–15, when one man was also chosen from each tribe. These stone bearers—and even more so their stones—hold symbolic value. When these stones are seen they point beyond themselves to the people as a whole.

<span id="page-355-16"></span><span id="page-355-8"></span><span id="page-355-5"></span>The deeper meaning of these symbolic stones is explained twice in this chapter, here and in Joshua 4:21–24. In both cases the explanation provided is to be passed on to the children when they inquire into the meaning of "these stones." The trope of instruction to the succeeding generation is common enough in the OT (e.g., Deut. 11:19; Ps. 78:1–8), but the detail of the children's questioning connects the teaching concerning the memorial stones with the event of the Passover and the initial exodus from Egypt (Ex. 12:26; 13:14).36 In both cases, too, the explanation is provided in the context of a "memorial" (Ex. 12:14), so that another link is forged between the departure from Egypt and the entry into the Land of Promise.

<span id="page-355-2"></span><span id="page-355-1"></span>The first account is now given by Joshua to the twelve chosen men. He is not only an instructor but an interpreter. Like the memorial on the departure from

<span id="page-355-7"></span><span id="page-355-6"></span><sup>36</sup> Deuteronomy 6:20–25 also shares this feature, drawing in the larger exodus narrative in the service of explaining the meaning of keeping the law (cf. Deut. 11:18–21). It lacks the "memorial" element, however.

Egypt, here too the meaning is explained in terms of God's extraordinary and saving action on behalf of his people. The ark, which signals the Lord's presence, is the agent of the miracle: the waters cease "before" (Hb. *mipney*) it. The audience for the miracle and the memorial is Israel itself.37 In effect, the memorial is one that directs Israel's attention to the ark, and thus to the Lord who has acted so powerfully in this moment on Israel's behalf. These stones are instrumental in forging and maintaining a shared recognition and social memory of this saving event. That they serve a further purpose will be seen at the end of the chapter.

<span id="page-356-4"></span><span id="page-356-3"></span><span id="page-356-2"></span>4:8–9 This account of the execution of the instructions may induce some confusion, on two counts. First, the Hebrew pronouns ("they") lack the clarity of explicit nouns. All Israel does not gather the stones and set them up, as the text of Joshua 4:8 might imply; rather, the twelve designated tribal representatives ("they") carry them to the camp at which Israel ("they") has come to rest. In verse 9 some care is needed in perceiving that the twelve stones Joshua places in the riverbed of the Jordan to mark the spot where the priests stood is a different set of stones from those referenced in verse 8. This is signaled by the Hebrew syntax and the lack of a definite article with these twelve stones. The Septuagint makes this explicit, translating as "twelve other stones."

<span id="page-356-6"></span><span id="page-356-5"></span>4:10–11 With the matter of the twelve stones (both sets!) dealt with, the narrative returns to the matter of the crossing of the Jordan itself, into which the account of the stones is set. Here, too, matters unfold as Joshua has instructed. Verse 10 brings the additional and seemingly random detail that "the people passed over in haste [*wayemaherhu*]." This brief notice provides yet another connection to the departure from Egypt: when the moment finally came for the Israelites to leave Egypt, the Egyptians sent the people "out of the land in haste [*lemaher*]" (Ex. 12:33).

<span id="page-356-7"></span><span id="page-356-0"></span>The Hebrew of Joshua 4:11 presents a conundrum, as it could be read as stating that the priests bearing the ark crossed over "in front of the people" (Hb. *lifney haʿam*). How could the priests with the ark cross over "in front of" the people, who had already crossed? The ESV adopts an ancient solution, envisaging that as the people on the west bank of the Jordan turn and look they see the ark and the priests complete their crossing "before" them, that is, in their presence.38 The somewhat unusual decoupling of the ark from the priests is striking and bears on the understanding of an unusual detail of verse 18 (cf. comment on 4:15–18).

<span id="page-356-9"></span><span id="page-356-8"></span><span id="page-356-1"></span>4:12–13 The role of the Transjordan tribes was noted previously (cf. comment on 1:12–15). Here again they appear for explicit comment at the decisive moment of the crossing into the Land of Promise. The notice that forty thousand of them are "ready for war" (lit., "ones equipped for military service") picks up the precise

<sup>37</sup> This analysis follows Elie Assis, "A Literary Approach to Complex Narratives: An Examination of Joshua 3–4," in *The Book of Joshua*, ed. Ed Noort, BETL 250 (Leuven: Peeters, 2012), 406–407.

<sup>38</sup> This is Rashi's understanding. Alternatively Joüon, §118k suggests that in a number of cases the narrative verb form should be taken to signal not succession but rather summation, and on occasion "even for . . . a logically anterior circumstance," thus explaining the "apparent contradictions" of this verse.

<span id="page-357-3"></span>phrase used in Numbers 32:27 by the Transjordan tribes when the arrangements were first made with Moses.

<span id="page-357-8"></span><span id="page-357-4"></span>4:14 Just as the Transjordan tribes provide closure to the transition from Moses' to Joshua's leadership in chapter 1, so too here the notice of their crossing provides the occasion for noting the impression this complex event has on the perception of "all Israel" regarding Joshua. His exaltation is seen as the Lord's doing and is a further outcome of the miracle of the cessation of the waters of the Jordan. "Joshua has become the new Moses,"39 in fulfillment of the Lord's words at Joshua 3:7.

<span id="page-357-10"></span><span id="page-357-9"></span><span id="page-357-6"></span><span id="page-357-0"></span>4:15–18 For the third and final time in this episode the Lord addresses Joshua. In three swift sentences (vv. 15–17) the command is given for the priests also now to "come up" (or "ascend") from the riverbed. Although the Hebrew construction (*ʿalah* + the preposition *min*) is common enough in the Hebrew Bible, it is also the distinctive language used of the journey from Egypt to Canaan (Gen. 45:25) and especially of the exodus from Egypt itself (e.g., Ex. 3:8; 17:3; 32:1, 4, 7, 8; 33:1; Num. 16:13). Now used of "coming up" from the Jordan (Josh. 4:16, 17, 19), this construction adds another link in the chain of connections to the departure from Egypt in this account of the entry into the Promised Land.

<span id="page-357-11"></span><span id="page-357-7"></span><span id="page-357-5"></span><span id="page-357-2"></span><span id="page-357-1"></span>The departure of the priests bearing the ark from the Jordan bears some unusual—and usually unnoticed—features. As noted above on verse 11, the ark is distinguished from its bearers as the crossing of the priests is completed. Three distinct actions are related in verse 18: (1) the coming up of the ark-bearing priests from the "midst of the Jordan," (2) the "soles of [their] feet" being lifted to dry ground, and (3) the reflowing (and overflowing!) of the waters of the Jordan "as before." Translations since the time of the Septuagint have connected actions 1 and 2 as the conditions for the coincident occurrence of action 3, that is, when the priests leave *and* their feet meet dry ground, *then* the Jordan flows. This, however, is not the sense of the Hebrew. Rather, action 1 is the sole condition for the cooccurrence of both actions 2 and 3; that is, as the priests depart the dry riverbed, *then* their feet are "lifted up on" dry ground *while* the Jordan flows. Another factor is the passive voice of the verb in action 2. The Hebrew *nitqu* is a passive form of the verb *nataq*, with its meaning normally to do with being "plucked" or "torn apart"; it is nowhere else used of being "lifted," for which several other verbs are available (*ʿalah*, *rum*, or *nasaʾ*). The passive sense is correctly maintained by the ESV, although it is common among modern versions to recast this and make the verb active through a variety of translation strategies.

If the feet of the priests are passive, however, who—or what—is active? The obvious and surprising solution is that the ark itself "acts." The unusual syntax at certain points in chapter 3 identifies the presence of the ark with the presence of God in a striking way. So how is it that the priest's feet are torn from the dry riverbed, with their being passive in the operation? The Hebrew suggests it is due

<sup>39</sup> Trent C. Butler, *Joshua*, WBC 7 (Waco, TX: Word, 1983), 50.

to the power of God present in the ark. The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi found in this circumstance the explanation for the wrath of God against Uzzah when he reached out to steady the ark at David's first attempt to bring it into Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:7–8). Uzzah's sin was to fail to realize, based on this episode, that if the ark could lift its bearers out of (or over) the Jordan, it could bear itself.

<span id="page-358-17"></span><span id="page-358-6"></span><span id="page-358-2"></span><span id="page-358-1"></span>4:19 At last all the people are together on the west bank of the Jordan. Only at this point is the timing of the event stated in terms of the calendar; previously, simply "three days" passage of time sufficed for the narrative moment (3:2; cf. comment on 3:2–4). This exact day, however, the tenth day of the first month, is enormously important. This is the same day on which the final plague came in Egypt, the night of which Israel kept the first Passover and subsequently were sent out of Egypt (Ex. 12:3). The moment of exodus finds its counterpart in this moment of entry.

<span id="page-358-14"></span><span id="page-358-13"></span><span id="page-358-0"></span>Several locations in the Bible bear the name Gilgal, but this camp of the Israelites in the proximity of Jericho and near the Jordan, named here for the first time, is certainly the most important of them and appears most frequently. It will be Israel's base of operations throughout the opening campaigns of Joshua 6–12. Its last significant mention in Joshua comes in the episode of Caleb's securing land in 14:6. Thereafter its associations are less positive. In Judges 2:1, while the action is obscure, the movement of the "angel of the Lord" away from Gilgal at a moment of announcing national disobedience hints at discipline. Later still it is the site of the making and unmaking of Saul as king (1 Sam. 11:14–15; 15:21, 33), and among eighth-century BC prophets it was a place of apostasy (e.g., Hos. 9:15; Amos 4:4; Mic. 6:5). Those tragic associations lay far in the future. As will be explained more fully in Joshua 5, the site at this point is one at which God's promises for his people come to fulfillment as they now occupy the Land of Promise.

<span id="page-358-18"></span><span id="page-358-16"></span><span id="page-358-15"></span><span id="page-358-12"></span><span id="page-358-8"></span><span id="page-358-3"></span>4:20–24 As the episode concludes, attention returns to the memorial stones. Joshua has already offered one explanation of these stones' meaning for succeeding generations in Joshua 4:6–7 (cf. comments on 4:4–9), and that was offered in anticipation of their being set up by way of instruction. There the significance they hold for Israel was the focus of attention, and Joshua spoke only to the twelve stone carriers. In this second explanation, now given consequent to the placement of twelve stones at Gilgal and to "the people of Israel" (vv. 20–21), Joshua brings another element into the foreground. As in verse 8, their children's questioning prompts the explanation (vv. 21–22).

<span id="page-358-11"></span><span id="page-358-10"></span><span id="page-358-9"></span><span id="page-358-7"></span><span id="page-358-5"></span><span id="page-358-4"></span>The explanation itself completes the passage (vv. 23–24). The drying up of the Jordan's waters remains the act of God, twice stated explicitly (as verse 23 both begins and ends)—thus bracketing the notice of this moment's parallel to the miracle of the Red Sea. The entry of this generation into the land is thus of a piece with their parents' departure from Egypt: they are two sides of one act of deliverance and salvation. The ESV says the waters dry "for" (Hb. *mipney*) Israel, while other translations render this second explanation to say the waters dry up "before" Israel, contrasting "before the ark" in verse 7. There is a double reason given for

<span id="page-359-9"></span>this in verse 24. First, God has done this "so that [*lemaʿan*] all the peoples of the earth" will recognize this as God's power: that is, the audience now is not so much Israel, as in the earlier explanation, as her watching neighbors. Second, God has done this "that" (or "so that"; *lemaʿan*) Israel will fear its God. As the ark, then, was the focal point of the first memorial explanation, in this second account Israel is the focus and beneficiary of the mighty acts of God: through her the nations come to "know" this God; through this moment Israel learns what obedience looks like and what its benefits are as she "fears" her God (cf. Deut. 10:12).

#### <span id="page-359-1"></span>*Response*

In spite of the keen interest of this passage in shaping memory of this event for both Israel and the watching world, it has not generated the same interest or legacy as has the crossing of the Red Sea with which it is associated. The moment of deliverance on the exit from Egypt has captured the attention of poets and preachers far more consistently than has this moment of fulfillment on the entry to the Land of Promise. Perhaps it lingers in the hymn "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah" (1745), as the final stanza and its prayer, "When I tread the verge of Jordan . . . land me safe on Canaan's side," follows on the wilderness wanderings accompanied by "fire and cloudy pillar" in the previous stanza. William Williams, however, in the Welsh original—perhaps influenced by John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*—did not anticipate crossing on dry ground.

<span id="page-359-6"></span>But this passage is no mere echo or replica of that earlier, more seminal event. It has its own purposes and claims, and these have their own immediate aftermath, as will be seen in chapter 5, as well as farther-reaching implications for the life of God's people. The account as given attends mostly to the preparations for crossing over the Jordan (Joshua 3) and the memorializing of the event with the twelve stones (ch. 4), into which is recorded at various points the crossing of the people themselves—but getting ready and remembering are the more prominent concerns in the narration, and these are deliberately signaled in both chapters of the account in the person of Joshua and in the matter of the twelve stones.

<span id="page-359-10"></span><span id="page-359-8"></span><span id="page-359-7"></span><span id="page-359-5"></span><span id="page-359-4"></span><span id="page-359-3"></span><span id="page-359-2"></span><span id="page-359-0"></span>Joshua's exaltation (3:7; 4:14) spans the episode, and the mechanism for this is largely the elements of preparation it contains. This development was already signaled in the divine promise and encouragement as Joshua took up his role as successor to Moses (1:5) and found its response as spoken by the Transjordan tribes as the book began (v. 17). Now, as Joshua receives, communicates, and explains God's instructions at the moment in which God's presence intervenes with power to make possible their entry into the land, this promise is fulfilled. The intermediary role Joshua has taken on thus carries forward that which Moses exercised (cf. Deut. 5:24–29) and also anticipates the recognition the disciples will one day have of Joshua's namesake, Jesus, that he is the one who uniquely conveys the "words of eternal life" (John 6:66–69). It is important also to note that Joshua is not a replica of Moses (Deut. 34:10); the pointer forward to the raising up of a "prophet like me from among you" (Deut. 18:15) has a trajectory through Joshua, but it does not rest <span id="page-360-7"></span>there. Joshua mediates the rule of God to the people of God40 and provides direction as they occupy, then settle, the Promised Land. But, as we shall see, even this blessing contains flaws and seeds of dissolution that come to flower in the book of Judges. Nor is the "rest" Joshua's leadership gives stable and complete (Heb. 4:8). To make possible entry to that "rest" would require not simply God's appointed successor to Moses but the sending of his Son (Heb. 1:1–2).

<span id="page-360-6"></span><span id="page-360-4"></span><span id="page-360-3"></span><span id="page-360-1"></span>The memorial stones that so dominate Joshua 4 also span the account, having a hook in Joshua 3:12 (admittedly, a small one). Unlike the memorials instituted in the book of Exodus at the moment of departure from Egypt, which continue to play a significant part in shaping the worship life of God's covenant people, these twelve stones seem to play little further part in this people's shared memory. Perhaps that is no surprise; they are set up at a boundary of the land, and the people's attention—rightly—will turn inward, as the focus of their national life will find other locales for its expression (e.g., 8:30–35; 18:1). More than the stones themselves, the meaning they bear does have continuing effect as the story of settlement unfolds, as we may see in the very next episode. For the people, this event has displayed the power of God present in their midst to save and deliver. For the watching nations, the message is slightly shifted: the power of God is displayed in the movement of his people. To be sure, Rahab was already familiar with this ominous circumstance (2:10), but the Jordan crossing brings this reality to the very doorstep of the land's inhabitants and will evoke a consistent response—one very much at odds with the reaction that motivated Rahab.

<span id="page-360-5"></span><span id="page-360-2"></span><span id="page-360-0"></span>Surprisingly little attention is given to the response of the people themselves. They have no speaking part at any point in the proceedings, and the only insight to be gained into their understanding of and reaction to what is happening is in their obedient actions. There may even be in the brief note of 4:10b a subtle indication of the difference between this generation entering the land and their parents who left Egypt. Whereas it was the Egyptians who impelled their parents to leave "in haste" (Ex. 12:33), now this generation crosses the Jordan "in haste" of its own accord and at Joshua's express instructions. Calvin was impressed by this aspect of the people's behavior at other points in this narrative, seeing it as an aspect of faith, "for faith prepares us to perceive the operation of God." As the river dramatically and miraculously stopped flowing, faith was operative.

This, indeed, is the special characteristic of faith, not to inquire curiously what the Lord is to do, nor to dispute subtly as to how that which he declares can possibly be done, but to cast all our anxious cares upon his providence, and knowing that his power, on which we may rest, is boundless, to raise our thoughts above the world, and embrace by faith that which we cannot comprehend by reason.41

<span id="page-361-2"></span>5As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.

**2**At that time the Lord said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time." **<sup>3</sup>** So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.*<sup>1</sup>* **<sup>4</sup>**And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt. **5**Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised. **<sup>6</sup>**For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the Lord; the Lord swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the Lord had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. **<sup>7</sup>** So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.

**<sup>8</sup>**When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. **9**And the Lord said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." And so the name of that place is called Gilgal*<sup>2</sup>* to this day.

**<sup>10</sup>**While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho. **11**And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. **12**And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-361-3"></span><span id="page-361-1"></span><span id="page-361-0"></span>The boundaries of episodes in the opening section of Joshua are more fluid than chapter numbers would suggest. This is true of the single-episode pairing of chapters 3–4, which combine; it is true in a different way of chapter 5. Each of its four small vignettes could serve as a conclusion of the Jordan-crossing narrative that precedes: (1) 5:1 continues interest in the reactions of the "peoples of the earth" mentioned in 4:24a; (2) 5:2–9 and (3) 5:10–12 all speak to Israel's interest in <span id="page-362-5"></span><span id="page-362-3"></span><span id="page-362-0"></span>obedience in the land implied in 4:24b; and (4) 5:13–15 confirm Joshua's "exaltation," established before "all Israel" in 4:14. From another perspective, each of these vignettes also points forward, introducing the next phase of Israel's movements: Scene 1 anticipates similar language at 9:1; 10:1; and 11:1. Scenes 2 and 3 establish this generation, born in the wilderness, in a state of readiness for the demands to come of settling the land. And scene 4 is the immediate setting for the Lord's conquest of Jericho, narrated in chapter 6. This chapter, then, is more staging post than stopping point; it is properly transitional.

<span id="page-362-10"></span><span id="page-362-9"></span><span id="page-362-8"></span><span id="page-362-7"></span><span id="page-362-6"></span>Joshua 5:1 momentarily picks up the perspective explored in the Rahab episode (ch. 2), as the reader now gets a glimpse into the perceptions outside Israel of the miraculous events occurring in the region. The rest of the chapter returns to the intra-Israel story. Joshua 5:2–12 recounts two different aspects of the ritual preparation of the wilderness generation for life in the land: circumcision (vv. 2–9), which necessarily involves only Israelite males, and Passover celebration (vv. 10– 12), which includes the whole community. The final paragraph, verses 13–15, bears distinctive characteristics setting it apart from the rest of the chapter, and thus it is dealt with independently in the next section.

#### *Comment*

5:1 This brief insight into the reactions of the watching nations is dense with resonances to other passages. Attending to them heightens the sense of the transitional point at which the narrative has now arrived.

<span id="page-362-4"></span><span id="page-362-2"></span><span id="page-362-1"></span>The clearest connection on first reading is the reaction of the Amorite and Canaanite kings, with hearts "melted" and dispirited—exactly the characterization offered by Rahab of the "inhabitants of the land" (2:9). This observation brings another: this dismay was occasioned by news that the Lord had "dried up the water" of the Red Sea (2:10). Only three verses in the OT use this form of the verb "to dry up" with "water": 2:10, of the Red Sea; 4:23, equating God's work in drying up the Jordan with that of the Red Sea; and 5:1, in terms of the crossing of the Jordan only. Putting these together, it is clear that the forty-year memory that has continued to inspire awe has now had a significant update in the Jordan crossing itself. This moment shares fully in the dynamic Rahab described at yet another level: while the saving action is seen clearly to be the work of God, the fear inspired in the watching nations is of his people.

<span id="page-363-3"></span>To those retrospective connections within the book, another is added beyond it. The pairing of the Amorite and Canaanite kings with which the verse begins is striking. It is common to see these names as part of a longer list of nations to be dispossessed by the Israelites (e.g., 3:10; cf. comment on 3:9–13). But there appears to be only one other occasion on which only the Amorites and the Canaanites are named. As Moses begins to address the people gathered on the plains of Moab, he recounts the Lord's instruction to the Israelites to move from Horeb and to press on toward, and into, the Promised Land. As its extent is described (Deut. 1:7), these two nations are named and represent the entire sweep of the "land that the Lord swore to your fathers" (Deut. 1:8). These two names thus serve as a kind of geographical shorthand. Additionally, this subtler echo reinforces the sense that the God who met with Israel in the wilderness and above all at the "mountain of God" (Ex. 18:5) is the same God who now leads them into the land.

<span id="page-363-16"></span><span id="page-363-2"></span><span id="page-363-1"></span><span id="page-363-0"></span>The final set of connections from this verse points forward. As noted in the Section Overview, the distinctive wording "As soon as . . . heard" (Hb. *wayhi kishmoaʿ*) that begins this verse is found again in Joshua 9:1; 10:1; and 11:1. Together these plot the successive movements of Israel into the land, marking the occasion of their taking first its central region, then the southern and northern regions. This chain of events is anticipated here, as the news that is heard inspires fear. When it is met again later in the book, to that fear will be added outright hostility.

<span id="page-363-7"></span><span id="page-363-6"></span><span id="page-363-4"></span>5:2–9 If verse 1 is dense and allusive, these verses read rather as rambling and repetitive. However, an attentive reading shows the present Hebrew text to be carefully and purposefully arranged. The account of God's words to Joshua for instructing and affirming the circumcision of Israel's males in verses 2–3 and 8–9 bracket the central explanation of and rationale for this action in verses 4–7. What on first reading may appear repetitive turns out on closer inspection to be resonant, and a deliberate chiastic structure emerges.

- <span id="page-363-11"></span><span id="page-363-10"></span><span id="page-363-9"></span><span id="page-363-8"></span><span id="page-363-5"></span>(A) The Lord speaks to Joshua; instruction (v. 2)
	- (B) Israel circumcised; begun [+ place name] (v. 3)
		- (C) "Joshua circumcised them"; exodus generation died (v. 4)
			- (D) Failure of exodus generation to circumcise those "born on the way" (v. 5)
			- (D') Divine punishment of exodus generation, who perish in wilderness for disobedience (v. 6)
		- (C') "Joshua circumcised [them]"; wilderness generation instead (v. 7)
	- (B') Israel circumcised: completed (v. 8)

The two parts of the chiasm bear distinct overtones. With AB/B'A' as the narrative frame, CD recounts the historical circumstances giving rise to this intervention;

D'C' provides the corresponding theological evaluation of this situation. The divine speeches that introduce and conclude this episode bear this character as well.

<span id="page-364-9"></span>Observing this structure brings into sharper relief aspects of meaning. The failure of the exodus generation in the wilderness extended also to their failure to maintain a ritual purity in their nation. The D/D' pairing (vv. 5–6) makes this point most sharply: what might have been seen as simple neglect in verse 5 is construed in verse 6 in deeply theological terms as disobedience to the "voice of the Lord."

<span id="page-364-10"></span><span id="page-364-8"></span><span id="page-364-4"></span><span id="page-364-2"></span><span id="page-364-0"></span>5:2–3 Circumcision has been a sign of the covenant community since the time of Abraham (Genesis 17). Although known and practiced in ancient Egypt, circumcision seems to have been erratically carried out under the difficult circumstances of slavery and infanticide depicted in the opening chapters of Exodus. Its importance as a covenant sign persisted, however. This, at least, is to be inferred from the mysterious episode between Moses and Zipporah in Exodus 4:24–26, which holds some resonance with this moment of establishing the Israelite camp in the Promised Land (the use of "flint knives" in particular). There, maintenance of the covenant sign appears to be a matter of life and death, although the episode contains obscurities.

<span id="page-364-12"></span><span id="page-364-3"></span>The meaning of the detail that Joshua is to carry out this procedure a "second time" (Joshua 5:2) remains uncertain. One suggestion is that Egyptian circumcision used only an incision in the foreskin rather than its removal, as in Israelite custom.42 This second circumcision, the argument goes, was to complete the task and explains as well the "reproach of Egypt" mentioned in verse 9. This solution commands limited support in the commentaries and does not accord well with the explanation stated in the text itself: it had not been carried out "on the way" (vv. 4, 5), which is further understood as disobedience. It seems more likely, then, to understand this "second" operation on Israel as intended to return it to the state that, presumably, it held prior to the sojourn in Egypt (such as is implied, e.g., in the narrative assumptions of Genesis 34).

<span id="page-364-11"></span><span id="page-364-7"></span><span id="page-364-6"></span><span id="page-364-5"></span><span id="page-364-1"></span>5:4–7 The focus now falls on the exodus generation to explain this intervention in Israel's first days in the Promised Land. Although these verses may appear static, given the structure they display a discernible dynamic. The statement of Israel's moral failure and death in the wilderness is simply stated in Joshua 5:4–5 before a theological explanation for the sequence of events is provided in verses 6–7. The rhetorical emphasis falls on accounting for this community action, with the introductory phrase "And this is the reason why" followed by a chain of four further logical particles. As demonstrated in the structural analysis, the issue turns on the disobedience of the exodus generation, which by implication here includes its failure to circumcise the boys born en route. Why is there such concern at this moment to give such a thorough explanation? Multiple factors are likely in play. The obedience displayed here to the simple divine demand conveyed

<sup>42</sup> Jack M. Sasson, "Circumcision in the Ancient Near East," *JBL* 85/4 (December 1966): 474.

<span id="page-365-7"></span>through Joshua (vv. 2–3) carries on the disposition that characterizes this people through the first part of the book: they are obedient to a degree not seen in their immediate forebears. Verse 6 censures the exodus generation emphatically. The formula "did not obey the voice of the Lord" applied to those who left Egypt is used regularly for covenant failure. It harks back to the failure of the spies (Num. 14:22) and anticipates the explanation offered for the fall of the northern kingdom (2 Kings 18:12), as well as the final offense of the last of the Judean refugees after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians (Jer. 43:7; 44:23).

<span id="page-365-16"></span><span id="page-365-14"></span><span id="page-365-3"></span>The rationale offered here further exonerates this generation from whatever guilt or impediment their parents' failure had entailed. The use in this context of the striking phrase "a land flowing with milk and honey" (given "to us"!) in verse 6 further ties in with this understanding. In "Joshua and the Prophets" this phrase is used exclusively in "reference to Israel's obeying or disobeying its covenant with God."43 And positively, it has prepared this replacement generation (v. 7) for the celebration of the Passover, which is the immediate aftermath of the circumcision of the "whole nation" (v. 8).44 Israel must be in a fit state to keep the feast.

<span id="page-365-12"></span><span id="page-365-10"></span><span id="page-365-9"></span><span id="page-365-8"></span>5:8–9 The timing of the process is not spelled out by the narrator, but the time for "healing" can be inferred from the chronology specified in 4:19, dating the crossing of the Jordan to the tenth day of Abib (the first month), and 5:10, putting the Passover celebration on the fourteenth day of the same month. Thus three full days are allowed for this process, an echo of the "three days" between the investiture of Joshua and the crossing of the Jordan (cf. comment on 3:2–4). This is marginally better than the timing at which Simeon and Levi took revenge on the men of Shechem after they submitted to circumcision ("on the third day"; Gen. 34:25).

<span id="page-365-11"></span><span id="page-365-6"></span><span id="page-365-5"></span><span id="page-365-4"></span><span id="page-365-1"></span><span id="page-365-0"></span>In verse 9 the Lord again addresses Joshua, now with the assurance that the "reproach of Egypt" has been "rolled away" (a form of the Hb. verb *galal*). This is linguistically related to the place name Gilgal, already introduced in Joshua 4:19. That much is obvious, but what is intended by the "reproach of Egypt" is not. One suggestion has already been mentioned in the comment on 5:2–3. The two most common interpretations understand the "reproach" (*herpah*) to be shame either from the slavery Israel endured in Egypt or, more immediately in this context, from the state of being uncircumcised in the wilderness (cf. Gen. 34:14). But the Hebrew term can also have the nuance of "scorn," that is, insulting language. If this nuance comes to the fore (cf. Lam. 3:61; Jer. 42:18 [in a context with Egypt]), then perhaps the reviling of Israel's God and the nation itself, an integral element of the struggle for power during the plagues, is in mind. Now, as the people are rightly related to their covenant God, those insults have been silenced.

<span id="page-365-15"></span><span id="page-365-13"></span>5:10 Among the further exodus references relating to the final paragraph of this transitional passage, two in particular inform its interpretation. Now that Israel

<span id="page-366-6"></span><span id="page-366-2"></span><span id="page-366-0"></span>is ritually prepared to celebrate it, Passover observance immediately begins. This sequence is a matter not only of timing, although that plays its part (cf. Ex. 12:8; Num. 9:3), but also of obedience. On the brink of departing from Egypt (Ex. 13:5–6, noting too its use of the "milk and honey" phrase appearing in Josh. 5:6), Moses charges the people to keep the festival upon entering the land promised to "your fathers" (Ex. 13:5). The simple statement here of its observance is a further sign of the obedience this generation maintains as it enters the land.

<span id="page-366-5"></span><span id="page-366-4"></span><span id="page-366-3"></span><span id="page-366-1"></span>5:11–12 The second exodus reference illuminating this paragraph is one of the OT's deliberate intertextual connections. As Israel embarks on its journey from Egypt to the mountain of God after crossing the Red Sea, their immediate needs of water and bread are met by miraculous divine provision, each in response to the people's murmuring (Ex. 15:22–16:36). This in itself is a demonstration of God's merciful regard for his people (not dealing with them as they deserve), as well as his gracious provision (dealing with them as they do not deserve).45 The account of the arrival of "bread from heaven" (Ex. 16:4) concludes by noting, "The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan" (Ex. 16:35), twice repeating "ate." Now camped on the "plains of Jericho" (Josh. 5:10), they are at the border of the land. Three times in the space of verses 11–12 the narrator stresses that "they ate" the fruit of the land of Canaan. In both cases we see gracious provision, but of two different kinds: in the wilderness manna had a miraculous origin (cf. John 6:30–34), and now in Canaan Israel eats the land's produce, for which they have not worked (cf. Deut. 6:11; Josh. 24:13). And with the cessation of the manna their new life in the Land of Promise has truly begun.

#### <span id="page-366-12"></span><span id="page-366-9"></span><span id="page-366-8"></span><span id="page-366-7"></span>*Response*

This remarkable and rapid transition from Israel's being a landless people to arriving in their appointed home takes place against the briefly sketched but significant backdrop of the fear of the watching nations. The description of the emotions of the watching nations shares language with Rahab's account of the fear with which Israel was regarded on account of the actions of Israel's God. At this point the fearful response has not been translated into hostile action—that will be a later development. As of this moment, however, nothing prevents the kings of the Amorites and Canaanites from drawing the same conclusion Rahab did and adopting her solution: recognizing Israel's God as their God. This tends not to be the way of kings, however (cf. Psalm 2). But it is important to observe this space for a response that could lead to life, given the hasty, anachronistic, and mistaken accusations of "genocide" the book of Joshua can provoke.

<span id="page-366-11"></span><span id="page-366-10"></span>At the heart of this passage is a forthright contrast between the disobedience of the exodus generation and the call to obedience and faithfulness of the wilderness generation. This moment invites connections, too, to the prayer of Nehemiah 9,

<span id="page-367-6"></span><span id="page-367-4"></span>in which, centuries later, this very transition from wandering to settlement provides a means to consider and repent of generational sin, especially as it finds a foothold in Nehemiah's own time (Neh. 9:23–25). Concerns with ancestral guilt are mute in Western contexts but may be felt much more acutely in African and Asian settings, in which ancestors play a much more active role than they do in the Western world.46 Jesus' rebuke to the lawyers in Luke 11:47–52 suggests that it is not only an OT matter. The challenge of this wilderness generation on the brink of a faithful life in the Land of Promise is not only to reject and repent of the sins of the generation past but also to commit to live faithfully into the future. That they, too, ultimately fail (Neh. 9:26) provides its own cautionary tale.

<span id="page-367-7"></span><span id="page-367-5"></span><span id="page-367-2"></span>At least at this time they demonstrate a desire for personal purity in taking on the covenant sign of circumcision. This is what prepares them for keeping the Passover and enjoying the presence of God as the people of God. Even Deuteronomy knows of the circumcision of the heart (Deut. 10:16; 30:6; cf. Jer. 4:4; Rom. 2:28–29). The call of this passage is for that external behavior to be consistent with one's inner disposition.

**<sup>13</sup>**When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-367-1"></span>This briefly told encounter of Joshua with the "commander of the army of the Lord" begins abruptly. It is the only time in the book—or at any time from Joshua's first introduction in Exodus 17—that we see him individuated, on his own, without others around him. It is a significant moment, with an obvious echo to the encounter of Moses with the "angel of the Lord" at the burning bush in Exodus 3. What is Joshua doing "by Jericho"? He has already sent out

Still, the compressed narrative holds plenty of interest. These three verses divide in the middle: Joshua 5:13–14a describes Joshua's meeting with this mysterious figure, while 5:14b–15 recounts his dramatic reaction and response to the disclosure of the commander's identity.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-368-4"></span>5:13 The episode begins with Joshua "by Jericho." The more natural reading of the Hebrew is "in Jericho," although this has problems. Medieval rabbinic commentators took it to mean that the city's outskirts qualified to describe one as being "in" the city. One modern suggestion grants the Hebrew its natural force and then understands the episode to be a vision. While classical Hebrew has language to express "in the region of" more precisely, it still seems simplest to follow the typical English rendering "by Jericho," which falls within the semantic range of the Hebrew preposition.47 This grammatical point bearing on location takes on significance in the light of the commander's claim in verse 15: "The place where you are standing is holy." This "place" would seem not to be Jericho itself, despite the initial implication of the natural sense of the Hebrew.

<span id="page-368-7"></span>Even the wording that Joshua "lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold" bears some suggestive associations, although it is at first blush a fairly innocuous phrase. Of the fourteen times this full phrasing is found in the OT, nine of them anticipate divine disclosures.48 Familiarity with this biblical diction raises anticipation about just what, or who, awaits Joshua's encounter. This sense is further heightened when the figure is described as having a "drawn sword in his hand." To "draw the sword" is a biblical Hebrew idiom for an armed warrior, including times in which swords are drawn in the heat of battle. But on only two other occasions in the OT is a figure encountered with a "drawn sword in his hand." One appears in the exodus story, as this is the description of the angel of the Lord who intercepts Balaam on his way to confer with Balak, king of Moab, in Numbers 22:23, 31—a truly terrifying figure in the context of that story. The other is found in the Chronicler's version of David's census (1 Chron. 21:16; cf. 21:30). David, like Joshua, "lifted [up] his eyes and saw" a figure who held "in his hand a drawn sword," and David recognized it as "the angel of the Lord," who was working destruction in Jerusalem. With these wider resonances in mind, then, a reader would be alerted to the potentially

ominous, possibly supernatural nature of this figure who now encounters Joshua. Joshua, however, sees "a man."

<span id="page-369-1"></span>Even so, his reaction might be surprising: "Joshua went to him." No graphical description of this "man" is given, and speculation is futile—but he does have a drawn sword, and at this point Joshua is an intruder. But Joshua emerged as Moses' assistant for a reason. The first time he appears in the exodus narrative is in the battle with Amalek, in which it appears that he is well able to wield a sword himself (Ex. 17:8–13). Here, while it is possible to see in Joshua an element of impetuosity in going up to this man, this can also be seen as the assured approach of one who has known the Lord's assistance in more threatening situations than this. In any case, Joshua approaches and challenges the man: "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?" The binary for us/against us choice Joshua offers in this question is in keeping with other brief speeches he makes while serving Moses (Ex. 32:17; Num. 11:28; 14:7–9, together with Caleb). Significantly, the question is posed in terms of supporting Joshua's people or those opposed to them.49 But this choice will be resisted, as the man's response immediately makes clear.

<span id="page-369-4"></span><span id="page-369-3"></span><span id="page-369-2"></span>5:14 "No" is the simple and unexpected reply—unexpected because it requires a third option Joshua's question does not anticipate. In other words, Joshua's question has been fundamentally misplaced. The commander's reply makes clear that his identity transcends any form of loyalties on the human level. His presence and presumed power cannot be coopted by any group. This matter is of fundamental importance for understanding properly not only this episode but the book as a whole; it will be further explored in the Response below.

<span id="page-369-0"></span>Rather than offering a self-identification in terms of any human allegiance, the figure provides a title that places his status in an entirely different light. Several military generals in the OT hold the title *sar sebaʾ*, which finds different renderings in the ESV, as in other English versions; "commander of the army" is by far the most frequent.50 Only in these verses in the whole OT is the "army of the Lord" mentioned. What kind of army is this? The closest parallel to this language is found in Exodus 12:41, where the *sebaʾot* (pl. "armies" or "hosts") of Yahweh depart from Egypt. That, of course, is the company of Israelites, leaving their bondage to return to the land of their ancestors. So one possibility is that this figure is claiming supreme rule over the people, or "army," that Joshua is designated to lead. Another possibility arises in connection with the later designation "Lord of Hosts" (Hb. *yhwh sebaʾot*), used first at Shiloh (1 Sam. 1:3) and associated with the ark of the covenant (1 Sam. 4:4; 2 Sam. 6:2).51 This may suggest, then, a "host"

<span id="page-369-6"></span><span id="page-369-5"></span><sup>49</sup> Two distinct words in Hebrew are both rendered by "enemy" and "adversary" in the ESV, although the former is typically *ʾoyeb* and the latter normally *tsar*, as here. Simplifying, *ʾoyeb* carries the nuance of hostility, *tsar* of opposition. The language Joshua uses here, then, appropriately anticipates resistance but does not assume enmity.

<sup>50</sup> Hebrew *sar* on its own is a very wide-ranging designation (from "official" to "chief" to "prince") that requires some closer specification. On the military designation cf. Fox, *Service of the King*, 162–163. There may even be a hint of wordplay here: this figure is no *tsar* ("adversary") but rather is the *sar* ("commander").

<sup>51</sup> On the origins and development of this divine title, and especially its frequent use in the prophetic literature, cf. H. G. M. Williamson, *A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Isaiah 1–27*, vol. 1, *Commentary on Isaiah 1–5* (London: T&T Clark, 2006), 71–73.

<span id="page-370-12"></span><span id="page-370-11"></span><span id="page-370-3"></span>or "army of heaven," although (perhaps surprisingly) in the OT *sebaʾot* on its own most frequently refers to objects of illicit worship (e.g., Deut. 4:19; 17:3; 2 Kings 23:4–5; Jer. 19:13) rather than the "angel armies" celebrated in contemporary worship songs (but cf. Ps. 148:2). Either of these possibilities—one natural, one supernatural—could be understood as the "army" under the command of the figure now confronting Joshua, and perhaps there is no need to decide between them.

<span id="page-370-10"></span><span id="page-370-1"></span>Joshua's immediate reaction is one of prostration. This action may be offered as an act of worship to God, as understood by the ESV here, or as an act of homage to a human recipient; Saul and David both receive such obeisance (e.g., 1 Sam. 24:8; 2 Sam. 14:4, 22). Prior to this moment, however, the strongest resonance to Joshua's behavior comes in Moses' reaction to the revelation of God's divine name and character in Exodus 34:8. The strong sense here, then, is that Joshua recognizes a "man" deserving of worship. Although Joshua himself was "exalted" by God before the people in Joshua 4:14, here he is wholly subservient. The deferential form of his request for direction is further indication that any sense of Joshua's maintaining the initiative—as his challenge in 5:13 implied—has been set aside before this "commander."

<span id="page-370-8"></span><span id="page-370-7"></span><span id="page-370-6"></span><span id="page-370-4"></span><span id="page-370-2"></span><span id="page-370-0"></span>5:15 Just as Joshua's initial challenge failed to correspond to reality, so too his request for orders is ignored as he is informed about quite different matters. Any lingering doubt about the divine status of the commander is dispelled in his further response to Joshua. The language is familiar—it is very nearly identical to part of God's declaration to Moses in Exodus 3:5. This is an emphatic signal that Joshua's experience in this moment has its counterpart in Moses' meeting with God at the burning bush. For Moses, that was a first encounter with a deity otherwise unknown to him, at least by name. Joshua, however, has known this God and served in his presence for many years, so what purpose does this encounter serve for him? It cannot be one of commission, as in Moses' case, for such commissioning has already occurred in Joshua 1 and was anticipated by his appointment in Numbers 27:12–23. It should probably be understood instead as direct confirmation to Joshua of the theological information brought by the spies after their foray into Jericho (Josh. 2:24). The commander is to Joshua the visible corroboration that the Lord is with them in this place. If the assurance the Lord gives to Gideon when he's about to attack the Midianites is an echo of this moment (Judg. 7:9–14), it may say something about any lingering uncertainty in Joshua's mind about what awaits him and the rest of God's people. At a number of points in these opening chapters Joshua displays some uncertainty about the next step to take. While he has been "exalted" (Josh. 4:14) in the presence of the people, this direct, immediate encounter with the commander of the Lord's army offers weighty reassurance. The final words of the verse confirm that Joshua's attitude is not merely subservient but obedient.

<span id="page-370-9"></span><span id="page-370-5"></span>The one minor difference in the wording between this encounter and that of Moses in Exodus 3:5 is worth observing. Moses is told that "the place" on which he is standing is "holy ground;" in Joshua's case the word "ground" (Hb. *ʾadmat*) is absent, and "the place" itself is said to be "holy." This is, admittedly, a small difference. But what made the "ground" holy in the case of Moses was the divine presence itself at the bush that burned and was not consumed. Any such limitation is lifted in Joshua's case: "the place" that is "holy" here is the land that lies before them, promised by God to their ancestors and now given to this generation under Joshua's leadership. This has deep significance for the events about to befall Jericho, narrated in Joshua 6.

<span id="page-371-2"></span><span id="page-371-0"></span>The strong connection between this verse and Exodus 3:5 brings to completion a widely noted structural boundary to the literary shaping of the wider account of the exodus. It is launched with Moses' meeting with God at the burning bush, marked by the keeping of Passover, and continued by the deliverance of Israel at the crossing of the Red Sea. As the wilderness generation finally completes the exodus, this sequence is reversed: Israel crosses into the Promised Land through the miraculously dry Jordan, enjoys a first Passover, and ends with Joshua's meeting with God in the person of the "commander of the army of the Lord."

<span id="page-371-3"></span>This is not, of course, the end of the story. Its natural continuation is found in Joshua 6:2, in which further, and now explicit, direction will be given to Joshua about what should happen next.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-371-1"></span>Dramatic and brief, this episode has been a focal point for discussions of theophany, God's appearing to human beings. Such biblical appearances may take many forms, but the striking feature on this occasion is the imposing military character of this figure who confronts Joshua. Both his title and his demeanor emphasize his role as a man of war—identified with the name of Yahweh at the moment of Israel's crossing the Red Sea ("The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name"; Ex. 15:3). The drawn sword not only coincides with the "angel of the Lord" in other OT episodes but also anticipates the militaristic depiction of the rider on the white horse in John's vision, clearly identified with the triumphant Christ, leading the armies of heaven and wielding "from his mouth" a "sharp sword with which to strike down the nations" (Rev. 19:11–16; cf. 17:14). When the battle is to be joined, it is well that God's people should know and recognize that this is the one who goes before them.

<span id="page-371-4"></span>As noted above, the commander's refusal to accept Joshua's binary choice radically reorients Joshua and fundamentally realigns the loyalties of the participants in the struggle on this landscape. Joshua's question assumes that the matter turns on whether this "man" is on Israel's side. The resounding no shifts the crucial point, and with it the basic understanding of what is happening in the book of Joshua. It is not a case of whose side this "man" is on — in reality, on whose side God is on — but rather who is on the Lord's side. This brief exchange between Joshua and the commander who receives worship performs that shift.

It is not a matter of Israelite victory on one side and Canaanite "genocide" on the other.

God is neither *straightforwardly* for Israel . . . nor *straightforwardly* against her enemies. Rather, as seen in the stories of Rahab and Achan, what matters is alignment with and obedience to YHWH; the right question to ask is whether one is "for YHWH" or not, and not the other way around.52

<span id="page-372-0"></span>In this book, Israelites will die and Canaanites will live. The matter of life and death turns not on any national, let alone ethnic, allegiances but on whether one is loyal to the God "in the heavens above and on the earth beneath" (Josh. 2:11), to return to Rahab's formulation. And this is Israel's God.

<span id="page-372-2"></span>At this point Joshua's response is exemplary, and through most of this book so too will be the response of Israel as a whole. However, as the book ends this same answer ("no"; 24:21) will be heard again. As the people speak it on that occasion, the question remains one that probes the fundamental loyalties demanded by the true and living God.

### <span id="page-372-1"></span>JOSHUA 6:1–27

6 Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in. **2**And the Lord said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor. **3**You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days. **<sup>4</sup>** Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. **5**And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat,*<sup>1</sup>* and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him." **<sup>6</sup>** So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord." **7**And he said to the people, "Go forward. March around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord."

**8**And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Lord went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the Lord following them. **9**The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually. **10**But Joshua commanded the people, "You

<sup>52</sup> Earl, *Reading Joshua*, 140.

shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout." **<sup>11</sup>** So he caused the ark of the Lord to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.

**<sup>12</sup>**Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. **13**And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets blew continually. **14**And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.

**<sup>15</sup>**On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. **16**And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for the Lord has given you the city. **17**And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the Lord for destruction.*<sup>2</sup>* Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. **18**But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it. **19**But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the Lord; they shall go into the treasury of the Lord." **<sup>20</sup>** So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city. **21**Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.

**<sup>22</sup>**But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her." **<sup>23</sup>** So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel. **24**And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord. **25**But Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

**<sup>26</sup>** Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, "Cursed before the Lord be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho.

"At the cost of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."

**<sup>27</sup>** So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-374-2"></span>While the historicity of the conquest of Jericho has been the subject of much scholarly debate since the second half of the twentieth century, the narrator's concern is not in providing details of interest to later historians. Joshua 6 records the first act of conquest in the Promised Land. Yet in a book devoted to recording that conquest, no military activity is described in this first military foray. In this famous and (for many) familiar story this basic observation can still occasion surprise.

<span id="page-374-1"></span>As is often the case in biblical accounts of commands and their execution, the storyline contains repetitive elements; what is commanded is in turn carried out. The chain of command is consistent with that seen earlier in the book: God instructs Joshua directly, and Joshua in turn passes these instructions to Israel, along with some elaboration of detail. Here, as in the case of the crossing of the Jordan (chs. 3–4), the main characters are God, Joshua, the priests, the ark, and the rest of the people of Israel. These two episodes are the only ones to share these same dramatis personae, a signal of their close relationship. But the story arc is clearly longer than this, as Rahab and the spies first encountered in chapter 2 return in the latter part of this chapter. In that earlier episode interest in Jericho was central and the identity and fate of Rahab were decided. These come to fulfillment in chapter 6, with deliberate references to the earlier phase of the story.

<span id="page-374-5"></span><span id="page-374-4"></span><span id="page-374-3"></span>After the initial glimpse at Jericho itself in verse 1, the narrative of the week-long action against the city unfolds in a succession of dialogue/report sequences. Verses 2–14 narrate the initial commands—their delivery and the first six days of their being carried out, with the phrases "Thus [*koh*] you shall do for six days" (v. 3) and <span id="page-375-10"></span><span id="page-375-9"></span><span id="page-375-8"></span>"So [*koh*] they did for six days" (v. 14) framing the section. The events of the seventh day bring another set of instructions and their implementation—including the treatment of Rahab (v. 17)—in verses 15–21. Rahab's rescue is completed in verses 22–25, as the fate of the city is sealed (v. 24). The episode concludes with Joshua's declaring a curse on the city (v. 26), which bears the character of a prophecy (cf. 1 Kings 16:34), and the confirmation of Joshua's "fame" (v. 27).

#### <span id="page-375-12"></span><span id="page-375-11"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-375-7"></span><span id="page-375-4"></span><span id="page-375-1"></span>6:1 Just as chapter 5 began with a brief glance away from Israel to catch a glimpse of what was happening in the wider context, so too here a simple observation regarding the situation in Jericho sets up the account of Israel's actions in the rest of the chapter. When Jericho was last seen in chapter 2, it was already "shut" (2:7), with only those in pursuit of the spies allowed outside the city. They have long since returned (2:23), and since then the Israelites have crossed the Jordan, coming that much closer and increasing the fearful tension of the watching Canaanites (2:10; 5:1).

<span id="page-375-3"></span><span id="page-375-2"></span>Now Jericho is shut tight. The phrasing of the Hebrew of this verse is as tightly constructed as Jericho's defenses. The ESV's "inside and outside" seeks to capture the nuance of the active and passive forms of the same verb used here; "shut" and "shut out" might convey the sense as well, with the first form denying egress and the second denying ingress. And this is all on account of the proximity of Israel, the pivot of this verse. The latter part of the verse precisely echoes the first part: none goes out, and none goes in. Each verbal form in the verse is a participle. Combined with the fronting of the explicit subject ("Now Jericho"), these forms make clear that this verse is conveying simultaneous action.53 This is the situation in Jericho as Israel prepares to move into the land. The verse stands apart from the main line of narration beginning with Joshua's encounter with the commander in 5:13–15, which finds its natural continuation only at 6:2, after this moment's interruption to observe Jericho.

<span id="page-375-6"></span><span id="page-375-5"></span>6:2 Joshua's encounter with the commander of the army of the Lord was hardly disappointing, but it was not laden with detail. Joshua's request for directions from his commanding officer (5:14) did not receive a corresponding reply. But the instruction he sought is now provided, as the Lord speaks once more with Joshua. If it seems surprising that the voice of "the Lord" should now be heard, when the commander's might have been expected, this too is a feature of the appearances of "the angel of the Lord" (e.g., Ex. 3:2, 4; Judg. 6:12, 14).54

<span id="page-375-0"></span>The first item offers complete reassurance. If Joshua's solitary reconnaissance arose out of any lingering anxiety, this is wholly dispelled by God's simple statement that Jericho is wholly under Joshua's possession and control, as signified by the idiom "given . . . into your hand."

<sup>53</sup> On this syntax cf. Joüon, §166h; Waltke and O'Connor, *Biblical Hebrew Syntax*, §37.6d.

<sup>54</sup> "The angel of the Lord" does not otherwise feature in Joshua.

<span id="page-376-7"></span>6:3–5 But how the city is to be vanquished is explained in distinctly unmilitary terms. Rather, the terms of engagement appear to be composed entirely of ritual or ceremonial actions. Four elements in these verses bring religious concerns into prominence:

(1) The number seven is especially prominent: "seven priests," "seven trumpets," seven days, seven circuits—each of these expressing in some way the sacral associations of the number of completeness.

<span id="page-376-6"></span>(2) The priests are again in action. As noted in the comment on 3:2–4, the priests have only a limited role in the book of Joshua, bearing the ark during the Jordan crossing and now in the siege of Jericho again carrying the ark (6:6) and also blowing "trumpets." Priestly service involves, among other duties, handling holy things. This was their privileged task in the wilderness (as outlined in Numbers 3–4), and much later the Chronicler also focuses on this aspect of their remit (1 Chron. 15:2; 16:4–6, where there is also a conjunction of ark and "trumpet" [the latter a different Hebrew term, however]).

<span id="page-376-10"></span><span id="page-376-4"></span>(3) The presence of the ark and its role in the daily circuits of the city recalls its central role in the miracle of the crossing of the Jordan. There it represented the very presence of God and as such was accorded reverence and respect. Although here the people do not keep a great distance from the ark, as they did at the Jordan crossing, a significant buffer remains between them and the ark. The cohort of seven trumpet-blowing priests walks in front of the ark, and before them are the "men of war" ("armed men"; v. 7). The ark's identity here is no different from that in the Jordan crossing: it signals the presence and power of God as Jericho is taken.

<span id="page-376-9"></span><span id="page-376-8"></span><span id="page-376-1"></span><span id="page-376-0"></span>(4) In addition to the priests carrying the ark, seven more blow "trumpets," mentioned in five verses in this passage (vv. 4, 5, 6, 8, 13). Clearly, they play a prominent role. Most of these references are to a Hebrew compound (*shofrot*  [*ha*]*yobelim*) signaled in the ESV by "trumpets of rams' horns," which combines the most common word for "trumpet" or "horn" (*shofar*) with a very rare one (*yobel*).55 Typically, this latter term has to do with the "jubilee," best known from Leviticus 25. However, *yobel* as "trumpet" is used only in this passage (and on its own, apart from the compound, in Josh. 6:6) and at Exodus 19:13, where it is referenced again three verses later as a *shofar*. There it appears as part of the instructions Moses delivers to Israel as the people gather at the foot of Mount Sinai in anticipation of Moses' ascending and receiving the law. Some commentators connect the *yobel* here with the proclamation of the Jubilee (Lev. 25:9–10) and its related property laws in Israel that reflect the Lord's claim that "the land is mine" (Lev. 25:23).56 While the use of *yobel* may well suggest this link, perhaps more distinctive is its counterpart at the foot of Mount Sinai and the moment of divine encounter, implying a similar dynamic to this generation of Israel now poised outside the walls of Jericho.

<span id="page-376-5"></span><span id="page-376-3"></span><span id="page-376-2"></span><sup>55</sup> Hebrew *shophar* is used seventy-two times in the Hebrew Bible. Another term for trumpet, *hatsotserah* (used twenty-nine times), made of metal, does not feature in this passage, although it is also handled by priests and brings together war and worship in Numbers 10:8–10 (cf. comment on 6:15–19). 56 E.g., McConville and Williams, *Joshua*, 33.

<span id="page-377-14"></span>The circuits themselves might hold some ritual significance beyond their number. If circling the altar is the prerogative of priests in their sacred duties, perhaps suggested by Psalm 26:6, then their circumambulations would imply the approach of a sacrifice, and by analogy Jericho becomes an altar.57 Although stated tentatively here, it could also be seen as a further facet of treating Jericho as *kherem* (cf. comment on 6:15–19), and these features all cohere strongly.

<span id="page-377-9"></span><span id="page-377-2"></span>The result of all these activities will be the downfall, literally, of the city of Jericho (Josh. 6:5). The moment of capture described here in preparing Israel for the conquest anticipates precisely the outcome in verse 20.

<span id="page-377-13"></span><span id="page-377-3"></span><span id="page-377-0"></span>6:6–7 Similar to the pattern of chapters 1 and 3, the Lord's words to Joshua lead to Joshua's passing on instructions to those under his leadership, here to the priests and the rest of the people in succession. The deployment of the people seems to require Joshua to make some inferences about how the march is to be orchestrated, and he does so in verse 7. It is clear from the Lord's instructions that all the people are to be involved in the march, but it is not clear how they are to take their place in the procession.

<span id="page-377-6"></span><span id="page-377-5"></span><span id="page-377-4"></span>6:8–14 And so the first circuit is undertaken in the terms arranged. The only additional feature is Joshua's emphatic instruction to the people to maintain silence (v. 10), which comes across even more clearly in the Hebrew construction, which reverses the typical word order ("But the people Joshua commanded"), differentiating them from the priests and "armed men" in the rest of the procession.

<span id="page-377-7"></span>The final summary of this first day's action displays a differentiation of another kind: the ark's circling of the city is the decisive factor in the summary (v. 11). Just as the ark's movements in the crossing of the Jordan made possible the actions of the rest of the company, so too here the ark's circuit of Jericho is the important factor.

The next five days unfold in the same way as the first. Again the narration stresses the combination of ark, which represents the presence of God, and the trumpets, which signal divine encounter in this orderly march of priests, men of war, and the rest of the people. The final notice ("So they did for six days"; v. 14) provides the inclusio with verse 3, repeating the words almost verbatim.

<span id="page-377-11"></span><span id="page-377-10"></span><span id="page-377-8"></span><span id="page-377-1"></span>6:15–19 The seventh day and its seven circuits bring the action to a climax, and for it Joshua provides some reminders and additional instructions. For the first time the people are to add their voice to the sound of the trumpets (v. 16). Shouts and trumpet blasts come together in two different contexts in the OT. In the Psalms the combination comes at moments of worship and high praise of God (Ps. 98:6; cf. 81:1, 3),58 whereas in the Prophets it comes rather in moments of military

<span id="page-377-16"></span><span id="page-377-15"></span><sup>57</sup> Cf. Paul G. Mosca, "Psalm 26: Poetic Structure and the Form-Critical Task," *CBQ* 47/2 (1985): 230–233. The Mishnah tractate Sukkah 4:5 describes the altar processions during the "Feast of Tabernacles" (Sukkot), which occurred once daily for six days, then seven times on the seventh day. In Sukkah 54c Rabbi Acha says this was done as a "memorial to [the victory at] Jericho," so the association with an altar and the city to be sacrificed remained in memory (J. Neusner, ed., *The Talmud of the Land of Israel*, vol. 17, *Sukkah* [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988], 101).

<span id="page-378-9"></span>action (Hos. 5:8; Joel 2:1). Here at the walls of Jericho the actions are both ritual and military at the same time.

<span id="page-378-4"></span><span id="page-378-1"></span>Another, more surprising conjunction comes in the two parts of verse 17. First, Jericho is explicitly to be "devoted to the Lord for destruction," invoking the Hebrew *kherem* first mentioned by Rahab back in 2:10. As noted above, for something to be *kherem* is to be designated as wholly devoted to the Lord, and so beyond secular use and dedicated entirely to the divine domain. In the case of inanimate things this renders them holy and subject to all the rules governing sacred objects. For living beings—whether human or animal—this requires their death, as the life is consigned to God sacrificially (cf. Lev. 27:28–29). The Hebrew term, whether noun or verb, is used roughly eighty times, and at least one extrabiblical usage is known as well (line 17 of the Mesha Stele, or "Moabite Stone"). It is far more frequent in early texts than late, and rare after the time of Saul—although it is the last word of the OT as it is typically arranged in Christian Bibles, concluding Malachi 4:6 (3:24 MT). In spite of such frequent attestation, programmatic statements about it are few, with the central teaching passage found in Deuteronomy 7:1–5, 17–26.

<span id="page-378-11"></span><span id="page-378-10"></span><span id="page-378-6"></span><span id="page-378-2"></span><span id="page-378-0"></span>The analogy to sacrifice is helpful in another regard. One type of sacrifice is wholly given to God: the *ʿolah* ("burnt offering"; Lev. 1:3), in which the sacrifice is wholly consumed. In many other types of sacrifices, though, a part is given to God, a part is consumed by the priest, and the rest is shared among those presenting the sacrifice. So too with the *kherem*: its default is for the object under *kherem* to be wholly devoted, although different degrees of devotion could be specified. Here Joshua is insistent on a strict *kherem* against Jericho, with the direction given in Joshua 6:17 supplemented by the further instructions in verse 18 dealing with human and animal life (which uses the verb once and the noun three times) and verse 19 regarding metals. The urgency has to do with the dynamic outlined in Deuteronomy 7:26, which provides the pattern for the warning in Joshua 6:18: that which is *kherem*, like other sacred things, could communicate holiness and thus could not come into contact with the profane; such contact would occasion further destruction.59

<span id="page-378-7"></span><span id="page-378-3"></span>While the first part of verse 17 invokes *kherem* and its associated destruction against Jericho, in Joshua's next breath he speaks a word of life. Rahab and her household "shall live" because of her faithful action on Israel's behalf. At the moment in which judgment is announced, salvation is also proclaimed—and for a Canaanite household.

<span id="page-378-8"></span><span id="page-378-5"></span>6:20–21 The moment arrives. The narration is straightforward and unflinching, but with no sense of gloating or lingering over details. Matters proceed just as the Lord announced they would (v. 5). It is clear that in this most unmilitary of battle accounts it is the Lord who achieves the victory, as the city walls collapse, allowing the circling Israelites to enter "straight before" wherever they happen to be. The

<sup>59</sup> For the place of *kherem* in handling contagion and its cleansing cf. Richard D. Nelson, *Raising Up a Faithful Priest: Community and Priesthood in Biblical Theology* (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1993), 31–33.

<span id="page-379-1"></span>destruction of Jericho is truly an act of God, of Yahweh, who is a "man of war" (Ex. 15:3). The fall of Jericho owes nothing to any strategic planning by Israel or military power she might possess.

<span id="page-379-4"></span>At the same time, there is no evading the claim of Joshua 6:21 that the terms of the *kherem* are enacted by the onrushing warriors of Israel. No matter how few might be left after the city's collapse, they must still be dispatched. In this the Israelites serve as agents of the Lord's decree. This is the distressing moment for ancient and modern readers alike. Yet it remains clear that nothing makes this a precedent for a routine action, nor does it qualify in any way as a form of the modern conception of genocide. There are no close biblical analogies, but the victory of God over the army of Egypt at the Red Sea, narrated and celebrated in Exodus 14–15, probably provides some helpful parallel. The initiative, prerogative, and victory are God's, taken against those who oppose his rightful rule (cf. Ps. 2:10–13).

<span id="page-379-13"></span><span id="page-379-8"></span><span id="page-379-7"></span><span id="page-379-5"></span><span id="page-379-0"></span>6:22–25 Instructions for delivering Rahab and her family from the carnage in Jericho were embedded in Joshua's final commands. Now, after a hiatus of almost three chapters, she comes into the foreground once again. Here the situation is reversed from the previous paragraph, as the final statement of Israel's faithful execution of the *kherem* is noted in Joshua 6:24. This arrangement reinforces the contrast of Rahab and those she saved with the rest of the populace of Jericho. Joshua and the spies prove themselves faithful to the agreement made with her; she has proved herself faithful to Israel's God, and so she and "all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive" (v. 25). At this point they remain "outside the camp of Israel" (v. 23). She cannot as yet be counted an Israelite. There appears to be other sojourners among the company as well, according to 8:35. This mixed community is yet another signal that *ethnicity* and *genocide* are inappropriate terms for understanding the nature of Israel's conquest of the Promised Land. Keeping Rahab outside the camp may also have something to do with Rahab and her family's being regarded as "devoted to destruction" (*kherem*), in other words, yet allowed to live despite the rules for *kherem* (e.g., Deut. 7:2).

<span id="page-379-12"></span><span id="page-379-11"></span><span id="page-379-9"></span><span id="page-379-6"></span><span id="page-379-2"></span>6:26 Joshua's curse on Jericho becomes one of the great prophetic arcs in the OT, giving divine shape to human history. Its counterpart is found in 1 Kings 16:34 as the last action before the great prophet Elijah comes on the scene. Elijah's ministry testifies to the fact that the Lord rules Israel, not Baal or any other pretender. Here, as the oracle is delivered, the same principle has just been demonstrated: Israel's God rules over this land, as over every other.

<span id="page-379-10"></span><span id="page-379-3"></span>6:27 But the last word concerns Joshua. The declaration of his fame carries forward to the eyes of the nations what has already been confirmed to Israel in the Jordan crossing (Josh. 3:7; 4:14). Joshua's ability has not won him this recognition; rather, it is wholly a matter of the Lord's presence with him. Rahab saw Israel as being bound up with the actions of Israel's God; so now Joshua is seen in this same light.

#### *Response*

The fall of Jericho raises in an acute form the question of the relationship of divine and human action. In this first military activity of Israel in the Land of Promise it is clear that God's action and initiative take priority: Israel's marches, trumpet blasts, and final shouts are not the material cause of the collapse of Jericho's defenses. Its conquest is God's doing. And yet, there is something for Israel to do. The city's inhabitants and all they possess are consigned to destruction, with the valuables and metals devoted to the "treasury of the Lord" (6:19). This took real action on Israel's part. As the battles faced by Israel progress, these overt dynamics will change, but the principle does not. It is never a matter of either God's acting or Israel's, nor even a division of labor. Rather, as Jonathan Edwards well put it,

<span id="page-380-2"></span>In efficacious grace we are not merely passive, nor yet does God do some, and we do the rest. But God does all, and we do all. . . . God is the only proper author and fountain; we only are the proper actors. We are, in different respects, wholly passive and wholly active.60

This remains the situation throughout the battles recounted in Joshua. The land is God's gift, but it must be taken. Israel is, in Edwards's parlance, wholly passive *and* wholly active.

<span id="page-380-4"></span>This is, properly speaking, an act of faith, even an active faith. According to Hebrews 11:1, "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." This assured conviction results in the active lives portrayed swiftly and deftly in that famous chapter. Toward the end of his list of case studies, the author offers the fall of Jericho as the next-to-last named example of what can happen "by faith" (Heb. 11:30). In this sense, the faithful actions of Israel here remain exemplary for the believer, whose life of faith is to move by the same assurance and conviction as that displayed on the plains of Jericho.

<span id="page-380-5"></span><span id="page-380-3"></span><span id="page-380-1"></span><span id="page-380-0"></span>The issue of the violence displayed here also must be addressed. It is clear in the OT that the God who gives life is the one who alone can also take it: "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand" (Deut. 32:39). But Israel was called upon to wield God's sword (Deut. 32:41), even as from time to time God's sword was passed to pagan kings (e.g., Ezekiel 21). Christians today take up starkly differing positions on violence exercised by states vis-à-vis the life of the obedient disciple of Jesus. Yet even the first-century Jewish historian Josephus could develop a position in which taking up arms was to be resisted. In an impassioned speech to his compatriots, besieged in Jerusalem by the Roman army, Josephus reviewed Israel's history from patriarchal times to plead the case that

in short, there is no instance of our forefathers having triumphed by arms or failed of success without them when they committed their cause to God:

<sup>60</sup> Jonathan Edwards, "Remarks on Important Theological Controversies," in *The Works of Jonathan Edwards* (Edinburgh: Banner of Truth, 1974; London, 1834), 2:557.

if they sat still they conquered, as it pleased their Judge, if they fought they were invariably defeated.61

Josephus may have exaggerated the case, but the underlying contention is fair: only in acting in a manner fully consonant with the purposes of God was victory attained.

<span id="page-381-8"></span><span id="page-381-5"></span>While the NT continues to teach that the sword may be wielded by the state (Rom. 13:1–4), there is no sense that Christians now act as Israel did in the wars of conquest. Rather, in a trajectory that passes through the suffering servant of Isaiah 49:7; 52:13–53:12, God's saving action has to do with submission to violence, culminating in Jesus' cross. This, rather than committing violence, is what Jesus' disciples are now primarily called to emulate (cf. Matt. 5:11–12; Heb. 10:32–36). This is not suffering for its own sake, much less any form of religious masochism. It is rather to participate in bearing the cross, so as also to know the victory that Christ ultimately won through it (Mark 8:34–38; Col. 1:19–20).

<span id="page-381-7"></span><span id="page-381-6"></span>It is also worth noting that Jericho represents a city that refuses to recognize the sovereignty of God and chooses rather to persist in rebellious idolatry. For

when the Lord comes to found, to build up, and to perfect His kingdom upon earth, He also comes to overthrow and destroy the worldly power which opposes His kingdom. The revelation of the grace and mercy of God to His children, goes ever side by side with the revelation of justice and judgment towards the ungodly who are His foes.62

<span id="page-381-9"></span><span id="page-381-4"></span><span id="page-381-2"></span>Jericho resolutely refuses to consider the manifest sovereignty of Israel's God, but not so Rahab. After the promise of her confession in Joshua 2, her protection of Israel's representatives, and her patient expectation of deliverance, as this chapter ends her redemption is completed. The author of Hebrews follows the sequence of Joshua 6 in completing the case studies of faith in action. Jericho's fall was noted already (Heb. 11:30), and in 11:31 the contrast is drawn between Jericho's disobedience and Rahab's obedience, her faith-in-action demonstrated by her giving refuge to the spies. That obedience extended also to assembling her family and remaining in their dwelling built into the city wall—which is more than Lot managed to do when impelled to flee Sodom (Gen. 19:14). The danger to Rahab and her family was not principally from falling masonry; the danger was in being engulfed in the divine judgment that fell on the city, carried out by Israel's warriors (Josh. 2:19).

<span id="page-381-3"></span><span id="page-381-1"></span><span id="page-381-0"></span>Does her survival, then, mean that the Israelites failed to carry out the strict terms of the instructions for *kherem*? Leviticus 27:28–29, for example, excludes any possibility of redemption for those "devoted to destruction." However, this fails to take into account the nature of this holy, redeeming God. The principle at work is well articulated in James 2:13: "Judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment." The same notion is operative in

### <span id="page-382-1"></span>JOSHUA 7:1–26

7 But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the Lord burned against the people of Israel.

**<sup>2</sup>** Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." And the men went up and spied out Ai. **3**And they returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few." **<sup>4</sup>** So about three thousand men went up there from the people. And they fled before the men of Ai, **<sup>5</sup>** and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.

**<sup>6</sup>**Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads. **7**And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord God, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan! **8**O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! **9**For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?"

**<sup>10</sup>**The Lord said to Joshua, "Get up! Why have you fallen on your face? **<sup>11</sup>** Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings. **12**Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction.*<sup>1</sup>* I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you. **13**Get up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the Lord, God of Israel, "There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you." **<sup>14</sup>** In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe that the Lord takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the

clan that the Lord takes shall come near by households. And the household that the Lord takes shall come near man by man. **15**And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel.' "

**<sup>16</sup>** So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken. **17**And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. **18**And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. **19**Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel and give praise*<sup>2</sup>* to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me." **<sup>20</sup>**And Achan answered Joshua, "Truly I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I did: **21**when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels,*<sup>3</sup>* then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."

**<sup>22</sup>** So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath. **23**And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the Lord. **24**And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor. **25**And Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The Lord brings trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones. **26**And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.*<sup>4</sup>*

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-383-2"></span><span id="page-383-1"></span>After the book's introduction in chapter 1, the next seven chapters could be seen as two long arcs, each involving multiple elements. The narrative of Jericho found in chapters 2–6 incorporates the first entry of Israel into the Promised Land (chs. 3–5) and features Rahab, a Canaanite. The narrative of Ai, found in chapters 7–8, features Achan, an Israelite. The arcs contain numerous small parallels, but the key connection is the matter of *kherem*—of objects devoted to destruction, properly belonging to God—and how they are dealt with by Israel.

The first phase of life after the conquest of Jericho does not go well for Israel. If there was an expectation in Israel that the dramatic divine intervention that delivered the city into their hands would lead to a similarly easy conquest of the rest of the land, Israel was quickly to be disabused of this notion. As this episode begins, Israel's actions have attracted the wrath of God, hardly what one might <span id="page-384-1"></span>have expected after the fidelity displayed so far in the story. This sets up Israel for a painful failure (7:2–5) at its next target, the city of Ai, whose Hebrew name literally means "The Ruins," using a definite article (much like Den Haag, "The Hague" or "The Woods"). After the vanquishing of the sealed and fortified Jericho, how difficult could this be? Difficult enough for Israel to be defeated and for her warriors to be killed in action. It is only after a dramatic response by Joshua and the rest of Israel's elders that God's response identifies the cause of this failure: their sin, and divine wrath (7:6–15). Although all Israel feels the force of God's anger, there is a particular culprit, Achan, who is identified and executed alongside his household (7:16–25). With that judgment the Lord's wrath is appeased, but Ai remains untaken. The narrative continues in chapter 8.

<span id="page-384-4"></span><span id="page-384-3"></span><span id="page-384-2"></span>As with the fall of Jericho, Achan's narrative has its troubling aspects. Modern readers might find aspects of corporate punishment for what appears to be an individual's action to be unfair and unjust, whether it is Israel's initial defeat and its loss of Israelite life or the punishment meted out not only to Achan but also to his family as the episode concludes. Interpreters adopt different strategies to explain and understand these difficult dynamics. But the affront to modern readers cannot simply be explained away; a properly satisfactory solution must take the narrative seriously and consider the nature of Israel's God carefully.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-384-6"></span><span id="page-384-5"></span><span id="page-384-0"></span>7:1 Using an emphatic construction in Hebrew, in which the key term *maʿal* is used as both verb and noun, the text declares that Israel "broke faith in regard to the devoted things." This term is familiar in the OT, used more than sixty times, with about a fifth of those coming in 1–2 Chronicles, providing one of those books' central concepts. The verb has to do with personal infidelity, used almost always with reference to God but on rare occasions also of interpersonal relationships. The usage here, and its echo in Joshua 22:20, would appear to be the sole exceptions, as here it is used of objects rather than of persons. This outlines even more clearly the status of *kherem* as the personal property of God himself.

While the breach of faith is Israel's, the culprit is Achan. The extended list of patronyms identifies him precisely; he is, moreover, of the tribe of Judah. In a variety of ways Judah has been coming to the fore among the tribal groups, and this movement to preeminence continues in the latter part of the book during the land distribution and into Judges, as the first exemplary judges come from Judah. Achan's action, however, marks a setback.

<span id="page-385-0"></span>And so the Lord's anger "burned against the people of Israel." This was a frequent occurrence during Israel's wilderness grumblings in the book of Numbers, and it is similarly triggered time and again in the downward spiral recounted in Judges (cf. Ps. 106:40). During Joshua's time, however, this is the only recorded moment of rebellion that leads to a response of divine wrath.

<span id="page-385-7"></span>This opening verse, then, offers three different elements as the episode unfolds: Israel's infidelity, Achan's theft, and the Lord's anger against his people. By the end of the chapter, the matters of Achan and the Lord's anger are resolved; Israel's infidelity, however, awaits the end of chapter 8 for a full resolution.

<span id="page-385-6"></span><span id="page-385-5"></span><span id="page-385-2"></span><span id="page-385-1"></span>7:2–3 Joshua's leadership has been full of promise and, to this point, faithfully executed. In this episode, however, and again in chapter 9, his judgment can be called into question. With Ai as the next Israelite target, Joshua once again sends out spies. Unlike Moses' original sending of spies into the land at the Lord's express instructions (Num. 13:1–2), here Joshua takes the initiative to send out men. When they return, they are full of confidence and brimming with advice; "The spies are short on information and long on prescriptions."63 In fact, their report to Joshua in 7:3 consists almost wholly of instruction, with the only information imparted being the small numbers of inhabitants. But even their advice is on the woolly side, only roughly indicating the numbers needed—not what one expects in these battle accounts. They further signally fail to demonstrate the sort of theological insight that the two spies of Jericho imparted.

<span id="page-385-3"></span>Unlike the location of ancient Jericho, which has long been known, the location of Ai remains uncertain. It must be in the near environs of Jericho, but et-Tell, one site widely thought to be ancient Ai, has problems aligning with this account; in particular, it appears to have been a walled city with a significant population during this historical horizon. Other suggestions have been made, with the nearby Khirbet el-Maqatir being one strong, albeit speculative, candidate.64

<span id="page-385-4"></span>7:4–5 Joshua accepts this counsel and sends "about three thousand men," at least cautiously attending to the high side of the figures offered by the spies. Not only does Joshua seem to relinquish some element of his responsibility in this moment, but even more problematic is his failure to consult the Lord at all. The results are devastating, not only in terms of Israel's humiliation, defeat, and loss of life but also in terms of the absence of the God who has fought for them up until now. The

<span id="page-386-4"></span><span id="page-386-3"></span>closing observation that "the hearts of the people melted" puts them in the company of the Canaanites who observed their previous victories (cf. 2:11; 5:1) and of the Israelites who experienced fear at the report of the ten spies (Deut. 1:28). That Israel should so quickly find itself in this state after the experiences of the Jordan crossing and Jericho conquest is remarkable. Meanwhile, in Israel's compromised state, God is simply absent.

<span id="page-386-6"></span>7:6–9 Joshua's reaction, along with the elders', and his prayer attract our sympathy, and perhaps even our approval. His grief is palpable; his prayer intense. There is an irony in their protracted prostration before the "ark of the Lord," which has previously been identified with the Lord's powerful presence among his people, both while crossing the Jordan and in the operations against Jericho. They are learning that they cannot presume upon Lord's power exercised on their behalf.

<span id="page-386-1"></span>At first we might hear in Joshua's prayer an echo of Moses' prayer during the golden calf episode, when the Lord expressed an intention to blot out Israel and start over with Moses. At this Moses pleads for the people on the basis of the honor of the Lord's name among watching nations (Ex. 32:11–14 [esp. v. 12]; cf. Josh. 7:9). Far from a resonance with Moses, who sought by his intercession to turn aside the Lord's wrath in recognition of the people's failure, however, Joshua's cry has more the character of the complaints in the wilderness, attributing Israel's failure to God's action and longing to return to the far side of the Jordan, much like those moments when the exodus generation wished it had never left Egypt (Ex. 16:3; Num. 11:5, 18–20; 14:2). At least in Joshua's case the wish is for an alternate place to live rather than a place to die!

<span id="page-386-2"></span><span id="page-386-0"></span>Importantly, then, Joshua's intercession fails to reckon with the reality Moses grasped, confessed, and pleaded through: the matter of sin in the camp. "Where there is smoke, there is fire; . . . where there is what looks like punishment, there must have been a sin."65

<span id="page-386-8"></span><span id="page-386-7"></span>7:10–15 As soon as the Lord speaks, the accusation is leveled. The blunt "Get up!" (Josh. 7:10, 13) may strike modern readers as harsh in the face of Joshua's distress and abasement. But such a judgment fails to recognize the lack of fitness between Joshua's words and actions. Prostration suggests repentance and confession, but Joshua's prayer is one of presumption and complaint. Joshua seems to think the issue is one of the Lord's shame and the people's well-being. The Lord's reply indicates that Israel's guilt is the problem; thus what is required is not lament but repentance and a removal of the covenant-breaking offense so as to repair the damage it brought to the relationship between God and his people.

<span id="page-386-5"></span>God's words highlight the same set of connections observed in verse 1: an individual's sin indicates community failure, which results in the destructive absence of the Lord. In this case, the issue revolves around the misappropriation of "devoted things"; the Hebrew word *kherem* is repeated six times in the space of

<sup>65</sup> Berman, "Sin of Achan," 124.

<span id="page-387-2"></span><span id="page-387-1"></span>these few verses. Here "covenant" breaking (v. 11) is another way of describing the breach of "faith" (v. 1); therefore, although objects are involved, the issue remains an interpersonal one. The connection between personal sin and communal guilt runs deep here. It is difficult to resist the implication that Achan's sin (with its dimensions to be more fully explored below) have led to the loss of spiritual discernment in Israel. There is no doubt that the root fault is Achan's, as the text goes on to make abundantly clear. But individual sin, when harbored in the community, brings deeply damaging results for the nation, particularly in its relationship with its covenant God.

Thus the instruction Joshua receives focuses on the consecration of the people: they have lost their status as holy and rendered themselves no different than the Canaanites, for they have lost their connection with their holy God. The process prescribed involves the discerning of divine choice via "lot" (*goral*), only implied here but explicitly named over twenty-five times in the distribution of the land in the latter half of the book. The same process (and language) occurs twice in the narrative of Saul, once at his selection as king (1 Sam. 10:20–21) and once to discern guilt in oath-breaking (1 Sam. 14:41–42), which is very close to the situation here.

<span id="page-387-7"></span><span id="page-387-6"></span><span id="page-387-4"></span><span id="page-387-3"></span><span id="page-387-0"></span>7:16–18 Joshua complies, and, like other major and divinely-instructed initiatives, the process begins the next day (cf. Josh. 3:1; 6:12, 15). The passage of time is significant. The news of the problem and its remedy will be public knowledge, and it is difficult to imagine that Achan would remain unaware of the situation. There is space, then, for him still to come forward—although, given the severe repercussions of divine judgment (7:15), it is likewise easy to appreciate why Achan might not do so. Beside this, one ought also to observe Rahab's treatment: although she was one of the people placed under *kherem* (cf. Introduction: Interpretive Challenges), her declaration on behalf of the Lord achieved for her salvation from that judgment. There is, then, some space in which God's grace might operate but this would require Achan's repentance, which is not forthcoming.

The next day, then, as the selection process unfolds, Achan is inexorably and inevitably identified.

<span id="page-387-5"></span>7:19 Under these circumstances, Joshua's invitation to Achan to divulge his wrongdoing may seem oddly worded. This appears to be the wrong moment for Achan to "give glory" and "give praise" to God. However, these phrases carry a nuance not immediately apparent. Regarding the first of these two clauses, several different Hebrew verbs of "giving" may be used with "glory" (Hb. *kabod*), but the one used here, a form of *sim*, is found with *kabod* on only two other occasions in the Masoretic Text. In both of these, Psalm 66:2–3 and Isaiah 42:12–13, giving glory is accompanied by a declaration of the rule of God and his victory over his enemies.66

<span id="page-387-8"></span><sup>66</sup> For discussion cf. Marilyn E. Burton, *The Semantics of Glory: A Cognitive, Corpus-Based Approach to Hebrew Word Meaning* (Leiden: Brill, 2017), 153, 265. In view of simplistic associations often suggested between "weight" and "glory" in biblical Hebrew, it is worth attending to Burton's conclusions, which note, in part, that *kabod* exhibits a "strong participation in the metaphor glory is height," and that it "constitute[s] and [is] consequent on, righteous behaviour"; *kabod* "is also, notably, instrumental in sanctification and purification" (300–301).

And the word for "praise" (*todah*) may be rendered "confession" (cf. ESV mg.). This is the only verse in the OT in which *kabod* and *todah* come together. Given the nuance attached to "glory" here, taking *todah* as "confession" makes good sense. If the sense of *todah* in legal contexts is to convey an acknowledgment of the justice of the judgment rendered,67 then Joshua is calling on Achan not only to confess his own guilt but also to declare that God is in the right in delivering this judgment.

<span id="page-388-6"></span><span id="page-388-3"></span>7:20–21 Achan now admits his sin against the Lord. He appears to have little choice. It is clear that what he has taken had value, although it is nearly impossible to quantify it in modern terms. The precious metal and clothing is, at least, similar in makeup to the riches Gehazi finds impossible to forgo (2 Kings 5:20– 23). Commentators differ on the precise amount of gold and silver Achan takes, but roughly 20 oz (550 g) of gold and 80 oz (2,200 g) of silver approximates the amount. While clearly of great value, the volume of goods taken means that it all could have been "transported and hidden with ease."68 Presumably it could easily have been hidden "in the earth inside my tent," too, although how Achan could do so without the complicity of his household is difficult to say.

<span id="page-388-5"></span><span id="page-388-0"></span>Tellingly, Achan describes having seen these goods "among the spoil"—but in this battle with Jericho there was to be no spoil (Josh. 46:17–19, 24; cf. Deut. 7:25–26). It was all *kherem*, devoted to destruction and thus belonging to God. This is a subtle but significant category mistake on Achan's part, providing a glimpse into his self-rationale for this action.

<span id="page-388-4"></span>7:22–25 Once Achan's story is confirmed, the Lord's judgment is carried out. The stoning is not only of Achan, the culprit; his "sons and daughters" and livestock are likewise stoned. Further, all of his belongings are destroyed, along with the contraband. Given the detail of the list, the absence of a wife is notable and perhaps implies Achan is a widower. This inclusive punishment when a single perpetrator has been identified has vexed interpreters for centuries. In modern interpretation three notions have been explored to understand this event. Perhaps the best known, but now least widely accepted among scholars, is the idea of "corporate personality" or "corporate responsibility." This legal-anthropological concept, it was argued, meant that individual identity was subsumed under that of a larger grouping or community, so that the aggregate was implicated in the actions of any one member. This idea has come under strong criticism in its own right, and in any case has been found wanting in the specific case of Achan.69 A second explanation has been found in the matter of the *kherem* itself; as sacred objects communicate contagion, so too does *kherem* (cf. comment on 6:15–19). This would account for the suffering of Israel as a whole and the more strict judgment against Achan's family, who harbored the devoted items. This has some cogency, especially in light of Deuteronomy 7:26, which warns against taking an "abominable thing"

into one's house, lest one "become devoted to destruction like it." A third factor to consider is the likely complicity of Achan's household in his crime. Perhaps it would be possible for Achan to conceal these items—portable, yes, but still bulky enough—without the knowledge of the rest of the family occupying the tent with him, but it seems most unlikely. Would this consideration be sufficient to explain the destruction of his animals and goods, however? On balance, a combination of the latter two factors offers the most explanatory power for an outcome for a crime that has cosmic dimensions.

<span id="page-389-5"></span><span id="page-389-3"></span><span id="page-389-2"></span><span id="page-389-0"></span>7:26 The account ends with a mound of stones raised to memorialize the event. The connection is not explicitly made to the sets of memorial stones set up to commemorate the crossing of the Jordan recounted in Joshua 4; this is left to the reader. The significance is analogous to the pairing of Psalms 105 and 106. Not only should the mighty acts of God remain in memory; there is a place, too, for remembering the destructive effects of sin, with each theme in its different way providing instruction in obedience. There are echoes of idolatry in Achan's crime. The temptation of gold and silver is not simply their great economic value but also their association with idol manufacture (cf. Deut. 7:26; Judg. 17:1–4). The wording that "the Lord turned from his burning anger" has two near parallels in the OT: Deuteronomy 13:17 (which also deals with the Hb. *kherem*) and 2 Kings 23:26. Both have to do with idolatrous actions among God's people. The Deuteronomy text is especially instructive, as it is in one of three paragraphs dealing with covenant loyalty and what Israel must do to remove the offense to God from its midst. Israel is shamed, but her repentance and removal of the devoted items makes it possible for her to be restored once again to God's presence.

#### <span id="page-389-4"></span><span id="page-389-1"></span>*Response*

Joshua's reputation is tarnished in this episode. It is true that this is incremental and not a wreck, but warning signs here will emerge again as the conquest unfolds. The characterization of Joshua does not invite much psychologizing overall; we are not given any depth of insight into his inner life. This episode is one of the few that offer even a small glimpse. In spite of his years as Moses' assistant, and despite the direct assurances from the mouth of God, it appears that Joshua is capable of stumbling too. He is in some ways a more consistent leader than his predecessor, even if in some sense he ranks below him in the great scheme of Israelite history. But even with these advantages and with this stability, Joshua's judgment is impaired at the moment his dependence on God grows slack. That a leader of Joshua's stature could be susceptible to such neglect serves as a warning to all who lead God's people or aspire to do so.

Like leader, like people. There are implications here for Israel as well. At a narrative level, the initial report that leads to the defeat by Ai and the death of Israelite men is rooted in complacency and a deep sense of self-sufficiency. This is something like the opposite of the ten spies in Moses' day, whose assessment was <span id="page-390-7"></span><span id="page-390-1"></span><span id="page-390-0"></span>that the Canaanites were unconquerable, and thus that pressing on was not an option (Num. 13:32–14:4). When Israel eventually decided—presumptuously to attempt battle, that too led to defeat (Num. 14:44–45). It is difficult to say to what extent Achan's sin contributes to the clouded judgment of the people. A pattern can be seen in Scripture of a dynamic in which provoking God's wrath leads to such impaired discernment (e.g., 2 Sam. 24:1; Ps. 73:18, 21–22; John 5:14; Gal. 3:1; Rev. 2:20–23). This generation of Israel is well placed to understand that it does not move forward in its own strength: it would have to reflect for only a moment on the manner of its crossing the Jordan or defeating Jericho to understand this. And yet at the next step come a significant stumble.

<span id="page-390-12"></span><span id="page-390-6"></span><span id="page-390-5"></span>This all seems to be very much an "OT" scenario, but, as the references immediately above suggest, it is in fact the sustained pattern of God's relationship with the world he has made. What seems more significant is that Achan's story holds two important echoes in later times. One comes in the disobedience of Saul over instructions concerning the destruction of the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15. It too is a story of *kherem* ignored (the word is used eight times in that account; cf. esp. 1 Sam. 15:3, 8–9) and comes at the foundation of the monarchy, leading to Saul's rejection as king, as he is seen to be responsible for his failure to obey God's express instructions. The second echo is more distant and comes in the NT: the account of the dramatic deaths of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5 bears striking resemblance to the narrative of Achan. Both incidents (1) involve needless theft (*kherem* in Achan's case; glory in that of Ananias and Sapphira), (2) are robbery of that which belongs properly to God, (3) include complicit family (implied in Achan's case; explicit in Acts 5), (4) hold space between act and discovery for change of heart and repentance, (5) induce fear in the wider community, and, significantly, (6) come at the foundation of a new phase of life in the constituting of the people of God (landed Israel; the NT church).

<span id="page-390-9"></span><span id="page-390-8"></span>The strictness and severity of judgment in these cases seems to be associated with the pivotal moment in which God is doing a new thing, and these failures within the community of his people strike at the heart of that. In other seasons, even though God's patience is graciously extended, the dynamic does not entirely disappear. At the beginning of Romans, Paul's account of the exchanges that sin occasions, with the divine response of God's "giving them up" (Rom. 1:26), finds its summary statement in a warning against presuming on the patience of God (Rom. 2:3–5). But God's judgments are redemptive for those who have ears to hear, turning to him in repentance and faith. Here too God's patience operates (cf. 1 Tim. 1:16; 2 Pet. 3:14–15), as indeed it did even in the cases of Achan, Saul, and Ananias and Sapphira. In their cases, however, the space for grace confirmed them in their rebellion rather than leading to repentance and a changed life.

<span id="page-390-11"></span><span id="page-390-10"></span><span id="page-390-4"></span><span id="page-390-3"></span><span id="page-390-2"></span>Finally, the contrast between the fate of Achan's family and that of Rahab's is stark and explicit. The central narratives of each of Joshua chapters 6, 7, and 8 end with a comment on something that persists "to this day." In 6:25 it is Rahab's continued presence in the community; a burial cairn awaits in 8:29. Between these <span id="page-391-0"></span>two is the stone mound beneath which Achan and his family lie (7:26). It is no accident of narration that it should be so, as Achan might have been like Rahab: alive with his family among the Israelites. Instead they lie dead, suffering the same fate as the hostile Canaanites.

### <span id="page-391-1"></span>JOSHUA 8:1–29

8 And the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land. **<sup>2</sup>**And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city, behind it."

**<sup>3</sup>** So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night. **4**And he commanded them, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you remain ready. **<sup>5</sup>**And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us just as before, we shall flee before them. **<sup>6</sup>**And they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will say, 'They are fleeing from us, just as before.' So we will flee before them. **7**Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the Lord your God will give it into your hand. **8**And as soon as you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire. You shall do according to the word of the Lord. See, I have commanded you." **<sup>9</sup>** So Joshua sent them out. And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, but Joshua spent that night among the people.

**<sup>10</sup>** Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. **11**And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai. **12**He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. **<sup>13</sup>** So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley. **14**And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the men of the city, hurried and went out early to the appointed place*<sup>1</sup>* toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. **15**And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness. **<sup>16</sup>** So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city. **17**Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.

**<sup>18</sup>**Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched

out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. **19**And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it. And they hurried to set the city on fire. **<sup>20</sup>** So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers. **21**And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. **22**And the others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And Israel struck them down, until there was left none that survived or escaped. **23**But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him near to Joshua.

<span id="page-392-6"></span>**<sup>24</sup>**When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword. **25**And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000, all the people of Ai. **26**But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction.*<sup>2</sup>* **<sup>27</sup>**Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of the Lord that he commanded Joshua. **<sup>28</sup>** So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day. **29**And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-392-1"></span>The first campaign against Ai ended in ignominious failure (7:2–5). The bulk of the preceding chapter was spent in displaying the destructive effects of disobedience and in applying its divinely ordained remedy. As action against Ai is renewed in this chapter, the same sort of obedience that had marked Joshua's and Israel's behavior alike returns.

<span id="page-392-3"></span><span id="page-392-2"></span>This account includes multiple frames and narrative blocks that do not wholly coincide. The outer frame is marked by the fate of the "king of Ai," identified as given into Joshua's hand by the Lord in 8:1 and executed at the close of the text in verse 29. Within this frame two main narrative panels are set: the preparations for renewed military action in verses 3–9 and the description of the battle and its aftermath itself in verses 10–29. Contained in this latter block is an inner frame, marked by the Lord's further instruction to Joshua in verse 18 to "stretch out the javelin that is in your hand," with its record of fulfillment in verse 26 acting as the conclusion to the battle itself.

<span id="page-392-5"></span><span id="page-392-4"></span><span id="page-392-0"></span>The broad shape of this conquest, then, shares the main outlines with the operation against Jericho in chapter 6. In this case, however, it can be seen that <span id="page-393-3"></span><span id="page-393-2"></span>Joshua's initiatives and the effectiveness of the Israelite fighting force brings much more to the action against Ai than either did in the case of Jericho. A further issue brings a reminder of one of the features of chapter 2. The matter of Rahab's deceit in putting off the agents of the king of Jericho from discovering the Israelite spies was discussed in the interpretation there (cf. comment on 2:2–7). This episode shares something of that dynamic, as the stratagem that Joshua proposes and which meets with success against Ai also involves deception. For whatever reason, this ploy has not attracted the same kind of moral scrutiny as has Rahab's guile.

<span id="page-393-7"></span><span id="page-393-5"></span>The final deposition of the king of Ai beneath a "great heap of stones" (8:29) forges an explicit link to the fate of Achan (7:26), adding to the impression that Achan's identity was in effect that of a Canaanite.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-393-6"></span>8:1–2 After the death of Achan and the subsiding of God's anger against Israel, the Lord again speaks to Joshua. Every element of this brief speech bears reflection.

<span id="page-393-4"></span><span id="page-393-1"></span><span id="page-393-0"></span>The first words God speaks to Joshua have the character of a recommissioning. The encouragement not to "fear" or "be dismayed" are strongly reminiscent of his first words to Joshua as he took up the role of leading Israel after Moses death (1:9). Even more striking is the main commissioning of Joshua by Moses in Deuteronomy 31:8, in which these very words are used; here they may seem to Joshua to be a divine restatement of that earlier experience. If the force of God's blunt response to Joshua's lament following the Ai failure dampened Joshua's spirit, the encouragement given in just these terms would certainly act as a restorative. Further reassurance comes in the promise that Ai has been "given into your hand," just as promised to Joshua in advance of the campaign against Jericho in Joshua 6:2. It is, however, noteworthy that whereas 6:2 framed this primarily in terms of the city but included the king and people, here that situation is reversed: it is the king of Ai who is the focus, and his defeat entails people, city, and land. The king of Ai does not otherwise appear as a character in his own right but plays

<span id="page-394-13"></span><span id="page-394-11"></span>a narrative role here (although cf. 8:14), with this initial divine commitment concerning his defeat fulfilled in the final verse of the account (v. 29).

God's directions to Joshua concerning the action against Jericho were distinctly nonmilitary. Not so now, as a second battle against Ai looms. While the divine directions are brief in this narrative, they form a striking contrast to the counsel provided by the Israelite spies. The spies recommended to Joshua that only a small portion of the men be sent (7:3), but here God instructs Joshua to employ the whole fighting force in this action.70 In this case, at least, divine instruction is very different from conventional human "wisdom."

<span id="page-394-0"></span>Finally, there is the matter of how Ai is to be treated. Ai's fate is both like and unlike Jericho's. It is the former in that all the inhabitants are to be put to the sword. It is the latter in that Ai's livestock and goods are now to be plundered and taken as spoil by Israel. Tellingly, the Hebrew word *kherem* is not used, in contrast to its emphatic application against Jericho. Perhaps this could be thought of as "*kherem* light." There is a deep irony here, of course, regarding Achan's failure to observe the *kherem* against Jericho. In his confession to Joshua, Achan termed Jericho's goods "spoil" (*shalal*; 7:21), noted above as a category mistake (cf. comment on 7:20–21): it was not spoil but *kherem*. Now, however, Israel may plunder Ai and take "spoil" (Hb. *shalal*). What Achan wrongly took from the Lord he might now have legitimately obtained from Ai.

<span id="page-394-12"></span><span id="page-394-6"></span><span id="page-394-3"></span><span id="page-394-2"></span>8:3, 9 The brief essentials of narrative action are recounted as a frame around the full set of instructions Joshua delivers to the whole army. With a muster of 30,000 men, Israel now massively outnumbers the people of Ai, as the conclusion to the battle provides the information that its total inhabitants number only 12,000 (cf. v. 25). One wonders again why it was that the spies who initially scouted Ai thought an army of "about two or three thousand men" (7:3) would be sufficient to conquer the city: it was either misplaced self-confidence or impaired judgment, or a combination of the two.

<span id="page-394-10"></span>The encampment of the ambush is deployed "between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai" (8:9). The landscape plays a significant role in this account, and the narrator is clear in order to orient the reader to the lay of the land and the location of the two halves of Israel's army. When the time comes, the Israelites fleeing before the men of Ai will head east; the ambush lies to the west. All of this takes place at night (vv. 3, 9), the darkness obscuring their movements from the people of Ai.

<span id="page-394-8"></span><span id="page-394-7"></span><span id="page-394-4"></span><span id="page-394-1"></span>8:4–8 The instructions, now provided, sketch a military stratagem designed to fool the inhabitants of Ai into thinking their previous victory is being repeated. Joshua shows shrewd psychological judgment in verse 6, exactly matched by the response of the king of Ai (v. 14). What is the source of this plan? In verse 1 the Lord instructed Joshua simply to use the whole of Israel in this next engagement with Ai. But as Joshua concludes this briefing to the ambush contingent (vv. 7, 8),

<span id="page-394-9"></span><span id="page-394-5"></span><sup>70</sup> A wooden rendering of the Hebrew would be "people [*ʿam*] of war," a formulation used only in Joshua (8:1, 3, 11; 10:7; 11:7).

<span id="page-395-2"></span>he acknowledges both that conquest is in the Lord's gift—the very sign of dependence on God absent from the previous attempt—and that the actions they are to carry out conform to the "word of the Lord." The implication is that Joshua has not concocted this plan alone but rather owes the strategy to God's express guidance. Although this is unstated in verses 1–2, this kind of guidance is not without parallel in the OT. Another example of a strikingly explicit battle plan is one given to David as a word of the Lord, on an occasion still early still in his reign, that enables him to defeat the Philistines (2 Sam. 5:22–25).

<span id="page-395-8"></span><span id="page-395-5"></span><span id="page-395-4"></span><span id="page-395-3"></span>8:10–26 While various repetitions in the narrative can challenge perception of what precisely takes place, how and when the army is deployed, and even Joshua's own movements, the overall implementation of Joshua's plan is clear enough. Most of the force is stationed toward the north of the city; this is perceived by the king of Ai (Josh. 8:14). A relatively small cohort (five thousand, as noted in v. 12) is stationed toward the west of Ai. The pairing with Bethel, noted in verses 9, 12, and 17, adds another, better-known locale by which to situate the ambush party. In the summary of kings defeated by Joshua, Bethel is explicitly paired again with Ai (12:9). Meanwhile, the Arabah (v. 14) from this vantage point describes the direction of flight back toward the Jordan and the region of the Dead Sea—that is, away from the post of the Israelite ambush.

<span id="page-395-7"></span><span id="page-395-6"></span>In this extended narrative of the battle sequence three particular features invite comment.

<span id="page-395-1"></span>(1) The amount of detail provided for this military engagement is itself striking. The military aspect of the planning phase has already been contrasted with the paucity of such information in the Jericho account of chapter 6; this contrast extends to the account of the battle itself. The stratagem adopted by the Israelites offers better material for narrative development than was the case with Jericho. This contributes to a shift in perception of what God is doing in, for, and through Israel. He is, in a sense, weaning them off direct divine intervention on which they were wholly dependent in the conquest of Jericho.71 God remains directly involved to a significant degree, as explored below. But he has taken a perceptible step back, which in consequence develops Israel's skills and experience of battle. The process has only begun here, but the trajectory is set and will continue as Israel moves deeper into the Promised Land.

<span id="page-395-0"></span>(2) The king of Ai plays a more prominent role in this episode than the king of Jericho did in the sprawling account of the conquest of that city (chs. 2; 6). At the same time as God is, in some sense, stepping back, the Canaanite kings are emerging more fully into view. There is some echo here of the situation in Egypt during Moses' mission to speak to Pharaoh on God's behalf. Superficially, it appears that the struggle is between Moses and the king of Egypt. It is not. The contest, such as it is, is between the true and heavenly king of the people of Israel and the

<sup>71</sup> This theological dynamic is explored by Yigal Levin, "The Wars of Joshua: Weaning Away from the Divine," in *War and Peace in Jewish Tradition: From the Biblical World to the Present*, ed. Yigal Levin and Amnon Shapira (London: Routledge, 2012), 37–50, esp. 39–40.

<span id="page-396-4"></span><span id="page-396-3"></span><span id="page-396-0"></span>oppressive pretender (e.g., Ex. 11:3). This remains the situation as Israel makes its way into the land. The Canaanite kings oppose the God of Israel (cf. Josh. 5:1), and in so doing they oppose his people as well. In the narrative of Ai this transition is signaled principally by the prominence the king takes as agent in the story. Again, contrast with Jericho makes the point: the king of Jericho is intransigent yet remains passive in chapters 2; 6, being mentioned in passing only once, in the battle story itself (6:2). The king of Ai, on the other hand, is mentioned five times (8:1, 2, 14, 23, 29) and plays a pivotal part in the downfall of his own city (v. 14). From this point on Israel will take a defensive posture in their battles of "conquest," as the Canaanite kings take the initiative against her.

<span id="page-396-8"></span><span id="page-396-6"></span><span id="page-396-5"></span>(3) The pursuit of the fleeing force of Israel proves irresistible to the men of Ai. The city empties, left open and now undefended (vv. 16–17). At this point the Lord intervenes once again to speak to Joshua, with the instruction to "stretch out the javelin [*kidon*] that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand" (v. 18).72 This appears to be the signal for the ambush to attack the city itself, for this is the response in verse 19, although readers have not been informed of this aspect of the arrangements.

<span id="page-396-10"></span><span id="page-396-9"></span>Two aspects of this divine command to Joshua are noteworthy. First, although Israel is being called to a deeper military engagement than was the case against Jericho, God has not entirely stepped back; he is still delivering the victory. Here this takes quite a practical shape, as it is God's word to Joshua that signals the moment has come for the ambush to raze the city of Ai. In the absence of drone technology, how else would Joshua know?

<span id="page-396-1"></span>Second, there is the matter of Joshua's "stretching out" the *kidon* for the duration of this phase of the battle. This action seems familiar, recalling two incidents in the exodus under Moses. Some have drawn the parallel to Moses' stretching out his staff over the Red Sea as the people passed over and stretching out his hand as the water returned (Ex. 14:16, 21, 26–27).73 A closer parallel involves Joshua himself the first time he is encountered in Scripture. The first battle Israel faces subsequent to its departure from Egypt is against Amalek, recorded in Exodus 17:8–13, with Joshua himself leading the forces. In some mysterious way, the staff held aloft by Moses during this battle, as with the *kidon* held out here by Joshua, coincides with the action of God's fighting on behalf of his people. In both cases, the victory is complete.

<span id="page-396-12"></span><span id="page-396-7"></span><span id="page-396-2"></span>8:27–29 And so Ai is defeated. Three notices are provided as the battle concludes, each corresponding to an element of God's commands in Joshua 8:1–2 concerning king, city, and plunder, here in reverse order: its plunder is available and taken as spoil by Israel (v. 27); the city of Ai itself is reduced to "ruins" (Hb. *tel*), the meaning of the city's name (v. 28); and the king himself is executed and a cairn raised over

<span id="page-396-15"></span><span id="page-396-14"></span><span id="page-396-13"></span><span id="page-396-11"></span><sup>72</sup> The nature of the weapon that Joshua holds is obscure, since *kidon* is used only nine times in the Hebrew Bible. The LXX translators represented it by a variety of Greek terms: "javelin" in this chapter and "spear" at Jeremiah 6:23, but "shield" in 1 Samuel 17:6 [LXX v. 7], 45; "sword" at Job 39:23; "firebrand" in Job 41:21 [LXX v. 20]; and "dagger" in Jeremiah 50:42 [LXX 27:41], which quotes the Hebrew of 6:23! 73 Cf. McConville and Williams, *Joshua*, 43.

<span id="page-397-5"></span><span id="page-397-2"></span><span id="page-397-1"></span>his body (v. 29), as was the case with Achan (7:26), these two verses sharing the distinctive Hebrew phrase "great heap of stones," used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible only of Absalom (2 Sam. 18:17). The pattern of execution, exposure, and burial follows the legislation of Deuteronomy 21:22–23 and anticipates the same treatment meted out to the five kings of the Jerusalem coalition (cf. comment on 10:22–27).

#### <span id="page-397-0"></span>*Response*

The defeat of Ai by Israel displays aspects of the ways in which God prepares his people for accomplishing the purposes he has for them, and it is possible to see this as a gospel shape.

The fundamental element from which the whole episode flows is the matter of restoration to fellowship with God, the effects of sin having been removed. The compromising and debilitating effects of sin that led to the initial defeat in chapter 7 have been put away, punishment for sin has been rendered, and the guilty people are now restored. From the perspective of the writer to the Hebrews, Achan would have been like the exodus generation, which failed to enter because of its disobedience (Heb. 4:6, 11), even though Achan was among those who crossed over the Jordan. Now God speaks again to Joshua as he had at the beginning and acts once again for Israel.

<span id="page-397-6"></span>This renewed relationship meets a corresponding obedience in God's people, even as they are called to deeper participation and given more responsibility for bringing the mission to a successful conclusion. The first step in that obedience was to deal with sin in the camp. "The stories of Jericho and Ai indicate the need to obey YHWH through the covenant. It is this, rather than military tactics, that grants Israel success."74 Israel further demonstrates its obedience in forthrightly carrying out the divine commands as conveyed through Joshua in all its treatment of Ai, including the delivery of the king of Ai for death (Josh. 8:23, 29). This will be the fate of each of the Canaanite kings who opposes the God of heaven and earth. Grasping this helps to see how the book of Judges sets off in the wrong direction, as its first defeat of a Canaanite king sees his being dealt with in Canaanite ways rather than as God had ordained through the period of exodus and conquest (Judg. 1:5–7).

<span id="page-397-4"></span><span id="page-397-3"></span>With restoration and obedience is also provision. God does more than direct Israel through Joshua in its battle with Ai—he remains the guarantor of victory. The relationship between Joshua's holding aloft the "javelin" with God's acting on behalf of his people remains mysterious. However that relationship is to be understood, its import is clear: Israel does not fight this battle alone. Rather, as God's people fight, God fights with and for them, and ultimately Israel's success is dependent on God's action on its behalf.

#### *Section Overview*

Following the renewal of the authority of Joshua and the obedience of the community, what could be more natural than a ceremony renewing the covenant, in keeping with the instructions found in the book of Deuteronomy? However, while this short passage appears at home in its present context on a narrative level, literary, textual, and geographical issues complicate its understanding.

<span id="page-398-5"></span><span id="page-398-4"></span><span id="page-398-3"></span><span id="page-398-1"></span><span id="page-398-0"></span>At the literary level the transition to the next passage in Joshua 9 appears rough. That which stimulates the Canaanite kings in 9:1–2 is unlikely to have been this religious ceremony, as is mostly naturally inferred in the transition from 8:35 to 9:1, but rather the news of the complete destruction of Ai, which points back to 8:29. The Septuagint locates the present 8:30–35 after our 9:27, so that at least in antiquity one edition of the book directly connected the reaction of the kings of the central region to the defeat of Ai rather than to the covenant renewal ceremony. At this point the literary and textual matters merge: the "problem" of context in the Hebrew text is met by the arrangement of the Septuagint. With the discovery of Dead Sea Scrolls manuscripts in cave 4, a further ancient edition of Joshua was unearthed. Known as 4QJoshᵃ (= 4Q47), this text preserves a fragment in which the last two verses of the present chapter 8 are continued not by chapter 9 but by

<span id="page-399-3"></span>chapter 5.75 The arrangement of the edition attested at Qumran also makes good narrative sense, at least in terms of sequence of action: the renewal of the covenant and its memorialization of the law on the stones of the altar follow naturally on Israel's first entry into the land, with parallels in the literary features of the prominence of Moses' name and the use of the memorial stones.

<span id="page-399-4"></span>These textual scenarios share a complicating factor in the realm of geography: the ceremony takes place in the environs of Shechem, which will be the site of the final episode of the book—another ceremony renewing the covenant—in chapter 24. At that point the whole land has been conquered and the Israelite settlement completed. Shechem is a fairly central location, and so it makes good sense to gather there. But at the time of this ceremony the region is as yet unconquered. That Joshua with all the people should perform this ceremony at that location at such an early moment—whether it follows the crossing of the Jordan or the conquest of Ai—sits awkwardly at any point in this opening phase of the book but much more naturally in chapter 24.

And yet, here it is. An analogy from the Gospels may be helpful. Each of the four Evangelists organizes his story of Jesus' earthly ministry according to his own purpose in writing. The same events are not always recorded in the same sequence. The different ordering of the temptations Jesus faces in the wilderness as presented by Matthew and by Luke is one simple example that serves for many. The same principle applies to the ancient editions of the book of Joshua, and the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi, for one, assumed the account to be nonchronological at this point.

<span id="page-399-2"></span><span id="page-399-1"></span><span id="page-399-0"></span>The narrator sends strong signals that this event corresponds entirely with the commands given through Moses, found in two closely related passages: Deuteronomy 11:26–32 and Deuteronomy 27:1–8. Together these passages frame the laws of Deuteronomy 12–26 and thus bear an added weight at that level, enveloping the code that was to shape the life of the people in the land. In the first of these Moses instructs the people to "set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal" at the moment "when the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering" (Deut. 11:29). This comes with some notional geographic orientation and encouragement to obedience. The second includes more detailed instructions concerning the construction of the altar in connection with a set of plastered stones for offering sacrifice and writing a copy of the law. It is clear that this episode in Joshua is intended to fulfill this entry requirement. With the ceremony following on the stumbling and recovery of the people through the Ai encounter, the obedience Moses urged in both earlier passages takes on a deepened significance. The renewal of the covenant is not merely an optimistic moment after the Jordan crossing and before any attempt at "possession" (Deut. 11:29) has been broached. Rather, it takes place in the context of the lived experience of this

company, who knows what it is to fail and also to be restored by its covenant God. Thus this early performance of the renewal of the covenant has a particular import, distinct from the related ceremony at the book's conclusion.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-400-8"></span><span id="page-400-5"></span><span id="page-400-4"></span><span id="page-400-2"></span>8:30–32, 34–35a The frequent mention of Moses here makes an emphatic assertion of obedience to the divine command given through him. Prominence is given to this in Joshua 8:31, and it is also echoed in each of the two succeeding sections of this small passage (vv. 33, 34). This ceremony forms a link in the chain comprising 1:7, 13; and 4:10, which likewise connect the actions of Joshua and the people to Moses' commands. These are pivotal moments in the life of the community. The benchmark of fidelity to God's word through Moses is an integral part of Israel's progression into the land.

<span id="page-400-0"></span>As noted in the Section Overview, several elements in this passage reflect earlier commands of Moses recorded in Deuteronomy. Here, however, emphasis falls on Ebal, the altar, and the sacrificial "peace offerings" (Hb. *shelamim*) made upon it. These offerings, described in Leviticus 3; 7:11–18, are festival meals in which the priests and laity alike participate. The essence of the ceremony, then, contributes to the sense of unity among the whole people of God.

<span id="page-400-9"></span><span id="page-400-6"></span><span id="page-400-1"></span>Alongside the gathering for worship and sacrificial offering is also the promulgation of the Word. Joshua's writing of the law (Josh. 8:32) and the subsequent reading of it (vv. 34–35) call to mind the responsibility laid on kings to write a "copy of this law" and to "read in it all the days of his life" (Deut. 17:18–20). Here, however, Joshua writes not in a book for personal devotion but on plastered tablets for public display. He is no king, and, as will be seen below, he leads a remarkable people in this covenant ceremony that will—in the current form of the book—strike fear into the hearts of Canaanite kings (Josh. 9:1–2). But this "is not a 'monarchical' polity, with Joshua as Israelite 'king' in place of the expelled Canaanite kings. A new kind of people now has possession of Canaan."76

<span id="page-400-11"></span><span id="page-400-10"></span><span id="page-400-7"></span>8:33, 35b Appearing centrally in this brief passage, verse 33 presents a detailed roster of "all Israel" attending the ceremony. It is a remarkably inclusive list, but inclusive in a different way than its echo in verse 35b, which concludes this pericope. The grouping is conveyed slightly differently in the Hebrew text than in translation. All of the key Israelite participants—elders, officers (cf. 1:10), judges, and priests—are first enumerated, and then this company is glossed with the qualifier "sojourner as well

<span id="page-400-3"></span><sup>76</sup> McConville and Williams, *Joshua*, 46.

as native born." The phrase is embedded at about the halfway point of the lengthy verse, punctuating the report and providing a transition to the actions on Gerizim and Ebal in obedience to Moses' command. It is a remarkable detail. The book has already demonstrated through the story of Rahab that the barriers to belonging are graciously porous. It now appears that the makeup of "all Israel" includes those who are not ethnically Israelite. Whether these include, decades later, the descendants of the camp followers who left Egypt with Israel (Ex. 12:38) is impossible to say. The language that aligns treatment of the "sojourner" with the "native" is familiar from Exodus (12:19, 49), Leviticus (17:15; 18:26; esp. 19:34), and Numbers (15:29–30). It remains a fundamental principle for Ezekiel's legislation for renewed Israel in the only legal code in the OT outside the books of Moses (Ezek. 47:22).

<span id="page-401-7"></span><span id="page-401-3"></span><span id="page-401-1"></span><span id="page-401-0"></span>The priests are glossed as those who "carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord," recalling the precise language of the Jordan crossing in Joshua 3–4. Here, as there, this signals the presence of Israel's God with the gathered community.

<span id="page-401-4"></span>This passage concludes with another inclusive catalog of those representing the "assembly" [or "congregation"; *qahal*] of Israel" (Josh. 8:35b). Here women and children are explicitly included. The three-member set of men, women, and children occurs regularly in the OT (over twenty-five times), always to emphasize the complete community and often to signal its vulnerable and dependent nature. The sojourners are once again specified, the last mentioned as "those sojourners who were traveling in their midst" (AT; cf. ESV mg.). This account of the composition of the gathered community thus emphasizes the welcome that nonnative Israelites may have as they respond in worship and obedience to the covenant God of Israel.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-401-5"></span>As we now read this passage in its canonical context—the renewal of the covenant in the participation of the whole community gathered for worship, alongside Joshua's declaring the covenant blessings and curses and "publishing" God's word—it is this incident that, "as soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan . . . heard of this," induces them to gather "as one to fight against Joshua and Israel" (9:1–2). There is a political logic here, as the covenant declarations assert God's sovereignty over all nations.77 After three chapters of intense military activity, this account of all Israel gathered for worship provides a brief but clear moment of pause. The rightly ordered people, living in obedience to and fellowship with their covenant God, prove even more offensive to the watching nations than does their military prowess. It is impossible to miss the dynamic shared with the attitude of the kings of the earth hostile to the universal reign of God in Psalm 2.

<span id="page-401-6"></span>The nature of this covenant community was explored above. This is an inclusive community, with a central feature of the account being the presence of women and children and—twice mentioned—the sojourners among them, in addition to the men of Israel and its officials. Origen's ninth homily on Joshua treats this

<span id="page-401-2"></span><sup>77</sup> Cf. Creach, *Joshua*, 80. Creach notes in particular the provocative nature of Deuteronomy 28:1, 7, 10.

<span id="page-402-8"></span><span id="page-402-6"></span>passage. His proclivity for allegorical interpretation inclines him in this sermon to associate the earthly stones of Joshua's altar with the "living stones" (1 Pet. 2:5) of the church. The notion of building with stones takes him also to Ephesians 2:20, which describes how the church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone." Origen draws out the lesson: "In this edifice of the Church, there must also be an altar."78 It is not his interest to note the wider setting of his Ephesians quotation, although it is particularly apt for reflection on this passage in Joshua. There Paul is setting out the "mystery" (Eph. 3:2–6) that one people of God has been made possible through the gospel of Christ Jesus as it has come to those who were both "far off" and "near" (Eph. 2:17), so that Gentiles have become fellow citizens with the "commonwealth of Israel" (Eph. 2:12). The gathering with Joshua at Ebal, incorporating the sojourner in the covenant community, is at least a hint toward the fuller realization of God's purpose to draw to himself in worship every "nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages" (Rev. 7:9).

<span id="page-402-9"></span><span id="page-402-7"></span><span id="page-402-5"></span><span id="page-402-4"></span><span id="page-402-3"></span><span id="page-402-2"></span><span id="page-402-1"></span>The reading of the law in its entirety also attracts Origen's attention. While for him the association is made through 2 Corinthians 3:15–16 to the difference it makes when Jesus reads the law,79 there is another, more simple lesson for the church here. The practice of the public reading of Scripture varies considerably between local churches; in my experience, however, the tendency is toward neglect. Those traditions that use a lectionary may be helped in this. But the careful, articulate, thoughtful reading of God's Word among God's people is a powerful thing. It can bring kings to their knees (2 Kings 22:10–11). Reading is active on the part of the reader, but so too is listening (Luke 8:18).

### <span id="page-402-0"></span>JOSHUA 9:1–27

to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us." **7**But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?" **<sup>8</sup>**They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who are you? And where do you come from?" **9**They said to him, "From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the Lord your God. For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt, **<sup>10</sup>** and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. **<sup>11</sup>** So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, "We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us." ' **12**Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly. **13**These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey." **<sup>14</sup>** So the men took some of their provisions, but did not ask counsel from the Lord. **15**And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.

**<sup>16</sup>**At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them. **17**And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriathjearim. **18**But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders. **19**But all the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them. **20**This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them." **21**And the leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.

**<sup>22</sup>** Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, "Why did you deceive us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us? **23**Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall never be anything but servants, cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God." **<sup>24</sup>**They answered Joshua, "Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you—so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing. **25**And now, behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us, do it." **<sup>26</sup>** So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel, and they did not kill them. **27**But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord, to this day, in the place that he should choose.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-403-0"></span>The account of the Gibeonites is told over two chapters, as with that of Jericho (Joshua 2; 6) and Ai (chs. 7–8), and is the third of three specific encounters with <span id="page-404-4"></span>the inhabitants of the Promised Land in the first part of the book. Also like those battles the narrative of Gibeon involves a single city. But it implies a larger alliance, the so-called tetrapolis named in 9:17, and effects a transition to wider military engagements. From this point onward, as Israel subdues the whole territory, the "conquest" gathers momentum and spreads regionally.

The earlier texts involved individuals, Rahab and Achan, whose sharply contrasting identities, commitments, and fates had a clear evaluation and purpose. One is a Canaanite who, with her family, lives; the other is an Israelite who, with his family, dies. The story of the Gibeonites admits no such clear assessment. Commentators over the centuries have been vexed by Israel's lax treatment of the Gibeonites and troubled over how to regard the incorporation of Gibeon into the community of Israel. Given this difficulty, the exegesis of this passage proceeds in a different manner than that of the preceding chapters. The comment on content will proceed fairly rapidly, and then overarching questions in evaluating the story theologically will be considered. Who is acting on Israel's behalf? What theology do the Gibeonites hold? And how should the covenant made between Israel and Gibeon be regarded?

<span id="page-404-2"></span><span id="page-404-1"></span>The narrative outlines of the account are clear enough. Following the notice of the reaction of the Canaanite kings of the central lowlands to the Israelite covenant ceremony (9:1–2), a contrasting reaction is registered on the part of the city of Gibeon. Rather than participating in the hostile stance of the other Canaanites and risking destruction at the hands of the Israelites, the Gibeonites instead successfully seek a treaty ("covenant"; v. 15) with Israel by deception (vv. 3–15). Shortly thereafter their ruse is discovered by Israel, which leads to the question of what to do next. In view of the covenant made with Israel they are spared, but on condition of becoming "servants . . . for the house of my God," as Joshua puts it (v. 23), in perpetuity (vv. 16–27).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-404-0"></span>9:1–2 The nature of the reaction of these Canaanite kings has been discussed in the Response to 8:30–35 in relation to the covenant renewal ceremony recounted <span id="page-405-8"></span>in those verses (due to the textual complications of its placement in the flow of the narrative). In the canonical text the kings' reaction is occasioned by that ceremony, with its assertions of the supreme sovereignty of Israel's God and the claims this implies for the land. This notice has counterparts in 10:1–5; 11:1–5, in which kings of the central and southern regions, and then again in the north, have the same hostile reaction. As these passages portray it, all of these kings and their cities "fight against" or "make war against" Israel.

The story of Rahab has already alerted the reader to the fact that it did not need to be so; this outcome was not automatic, and it is the further contribution of the story of the Gibeonites to demonstrate that other possibilities for Canaanites were possible for whole communities, not merely for individuals and their families. But throughout this opening part of the book the predominant pattern is that of hostility and aggression provoked by Israel's presence and the power of Israel's God.

<span id="page-405-7"></span><span id="page-405-4"></span>9:3–5 The identity of Gibeon is not fully disclosed at once, and the information appearing in 9:17 and 10:2 adds to the understanding of who it is that now approaches Joshua and the Israelites. Gibeon was a city about 19 miles (31 km) due west of Gilgal, the Israelite camp to the east of Jericho, and only 6 miles (10 km) southwest of Ai. Although it is named as acting on its own behalf as the account begins, it becomes clear that Gibeon is the leading member of a coalition of cities in the region. Its status and power are, then, on quite a different level than Ai's (cf. 10:2).

<span id="page-405-10"></span><span id="page-405-1"></span>Whether the Gibeonites are to be regarded with sympathy or antipathy rests to some extent on how their characterization here is understood; the key to this is found in the word the ESV translates as "cunning" (Hb. *ʿormah*). When used in the context of what wisdom provides (Prov. 1:4; 8:5, 12), this word is translated in the ESV as "prudence." Beyond these instances the word is used only once more in the OT: at Exodus 21:14. This verse describes murder by stealthy intent; there the ESV also reads "cunning."80 A welter of other options appears across English versions, reflecting differing moral evaluations of the Gibeonites' actions; "wily" (KJV), "shrewd" (ISV), and "deceptive" (CSB) demonstrate the range. At this point in the narrative readers lack sufficient data to come to an informed judgment; a more neutral term such as "clever" (NET) might capture the sense. But even if the judgment is a negative one, this is not the first time in the book that deception works in keeping with God's purposes (cf. comments on 2:2–7 [regarding Rahab]; 8:3–9 [regarding the ambush of Ai]).

<span id="page-405-6"></span><span id="page-405-5"></span><span id="page-405-3"></span><span id="page-405-2"></span>9:5–7 The ruse is a simple one: the Gibeonites contrive to look as if they have traveled a vast distance by exhibiting stale provisions and dilapidated equipment, reinforced by their own claim in verse 6, emphatic in Hebrew: "From a distant land we have come[!]," fronting the origin of the journey in the clause. With Gibeon less

<span id="page-405-9"></span><span id="page-405-0"></span><sup>80</sup> The related Hebrew adjective *ʿarum* is used eleven times in the OT, famously at Genesis 3:1 of the "crafty" serpent (cf. Job 5:12; 15:5, both Eliphaz). It appears eight times in Proverbs, each time with a positive nuance and consistently translated in the ESV as "prudent."

than 20 miles (32 km) to the west of Gilgal, if they departed in the morning they could have arrived comfortably that same afternoon—hardly time for bread to go moldy or clothes and sandals to wear out!

<span id="page-406-5"></span><span id="page-406-2"></span><span id="page-406-1"></span><span id="page-406-0"></span>They explicitly request a "covenant" with Israel. This raises a further question regarding Gibeonite intentions: what do they know of Israel's traditions? Two passages in Deuteronomy bear directly on the Gibeonite initiative: (1) Deuteronomy 7 (cf. comment on 6:15–19) contains instructions for *kherem* relating to the nations to be dispossessed in Canaan; (2) Deuteronomy 7:2 stipulates, "You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them." However, the laws governing warfare in Deuteronomy 20 include the requirement to offer conditions of peace and servitude only for those "that are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here" (20:15). The passage goes on to stipulate terms of *kherem* for the near inhabitants along the lines set out in Deuteronomy 7. This matter will be further explored below in connection with the status of the Gibeonite covenant. But as representatives of Gibeon present themselves to Joshua and the initial interrogation begins, the terms in which the negotiations proceed appear to have these Deuteronomic laws specifically in mind.

<span id="page-406-11"></span><span id="page-406-9"></span><span id="page-406-8"></span><span id="page-406-3"></span>Although the Gibeonites have come to Joshua at Gilgal (Josh. 9:6) and address him (also vv. 8, 9–13), the "men of Israel" (v. 7) intervene, and both Joshua and these men are involved as the initial phase of negotiations concludes (vv. 14, 15). The "men of Israel" raise the initial concern about the proximity of these strangers, and only then does Joshua take up this line of questioning. The interaction between Joshua and this wider group will require closer investigation below.

<span id="page-406-10"></span><span id="page-406-7"></span><span id="page-406-4"></span>9:8–13 The Gibeonites now provide an account of their actions in keeping with the terms of the plan already set out in verses 4–5. But first they declare their distant origins—omitting any orientation in the landscape as to where their "very distant country" might lie—and their reason for seeking a covenant with Israel in their knowledge of Israel's God. Like Rahab (2:10), news of what Yahweh has done in Egypt and of the destruction of the Amorite kings Sihon and Og looms large in their reckoning. Pointedly, they do not betray any knowledge of the real trigger for their actions: the recent conquests of Jericho and Ai (9:3). There is no need, since the reputation ("name") of Israel's God is fully established on the basis of those more historically distant events, and any mention of Jericho and Ai might raise suspicions about their access to news of Israel's very recent battles.

<span id="page-406-6"></span>Their regard for Israel's God is left to implication rather than outright confession. While the Gibeonites show an awareness of God's power and actions on behalf of Israel in more distant times, they make no further avowals of respect. The counsel of their elders to seek a covenant is all the reaction described, with attention directed to the evidence of their provisions and equipment rather than to their regard for the Lord God.

<span id="page-406-12"></span>9:14–15 The response from Israel's side comes quite quickly and with remarkable trust in the Gibeonites' words. Three parties on Israel's side are involved in <span id="page-407-5"></span><span id="page-407-4"></span>concluding the covenant. First, the "men" whose suspicions sparked Joshua's line of questioning (v. 8) test the claims of the Gibeonites via closer inspection of their goods. At this point (v. 14) we find a very brief, and very rare, intervention on the part of the narrator: "But [they] did not ask counsel from the Lord." The phrasing in Hebrew draws attention to this lapse and uses distinctive language in doing so: "counsel from the Lord" translates *pi yhwh* ("mouth of Yahweh"). This is a phrase used often for the direct revelation of a command of God and one that concludes Deuteronomy 8:3, in which Moses declares that "man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord." Here the men of Israel consider bread only, ignoring what might come from the mouth of God.

<span id="page-407-3"></span><span id="page-407-1"></span>With the "men" of Israel satisfied, now Joshua makes "peace" and a "covenant" with the Gibeonites to "let them live," this last phrase making explicit the implication of the covenant and providing an echo of the treatment Joshua ensured for Rahab (Josh. 6:17, 25). A third party now briefly is added to these proceedings, the "leaders of the congregation," whose oath confirms the arrangements. And the thing is done.

<span id="page-407-6"></span>9:16–17 Although crucial for the larger narrative, the Israelite discovery and confirmation of the deception is recounted with extreme economy. The discovery comes after "three days," and the journey to investigate is concluded on "the third day" after the Israelite delegates depart. The reason such a short journey should have taken this long is of no interest to the narrator. It may imply simply a passage of some days, using a conventional number; perhaps the Israelite investigators are also confirming the locations of all the members of the tetrapolis mentioned in verse 17. In any case, the true facts of the matter are now known to Israel.

<span id="page-407-8"></span><span id="page-407-7"></span>9:18–21 The question now arises of what to do in response to the Gibeonites' ruse. Two of the three parties involved in confirming the arrangements with Gibeon are now at loggerheads. Joshua's absence from this moment of community crisis is conspicuous. The "people of Israel" seem inclined to destroy those who have duped them. But the "leaders" allay the hostilities of the people—also termed "all the congregation"—by pointing to the oath sworn "by the Lord, the God of Israel" (as had been done by the spies with Rahab; 2:12, 17), which cannot be broken. Joshua 9:21 reports the outcome, slightly elaborated subsequently, that the Gibeonites will be allowed to live, but only as "cutters of wood and drawers of water *for all the congregation*," that is, among the general Israelite populace, in accord with the leaders' commitments.

<span id="page-407-11"></span><span id="page-407-10"></span><span id="page-407-9"></span><span id="page-407-2"></span><span id="page-407-0"></span>9:22–23 Only now does Joshua intervene, and the rest of the scene is played out between the Gibeonites and Joshua himself. He first names the Gibeonite action as one of deceit, using a fairly uncommon Hebrew verb that carries the nuance of fraud and betrayal (*ramah*; used only eight times in the OT); it is used, for example, of Laban's marrying Jacob to Leah rather than to Rachel (Gen. 29:25) and of Michal's ruse to protect David in 1 Samuel 19:17. Further, Joshua directs their role as "cutters of wood and drawers of water" toward service of the "house of my God" rather than being among the people as a whole. It is difficult to know just what to make of Joshua's refining of the leaders' assignment of servitude to the Gibeonites. Service to the community at large would appear to be in keeping with the stipulation of Deuteronomy 20:10–11, that distant cities offered terms of peace "shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you."

<span id="page-408-9"></span><span id="page-408-6"></span><span id="page-408-1"></span>9:24–25 The Gibeonites reply in mitigation and defense, filling out their account first offered in Joshua 9:9–10. Now they provide a more personal reaction to their knowledge of the actions God had commanded to perform in the land: they came in self-preservation. And so they willingly submit to the terms Joshua has placed on them.

<span id="page-408-10"></span><span id="page-408-8"></span>9:26–27 The final verses draw the threads together, wholly described in terms of Joshua's decisions that bear on the future of the Gibeonites. Their continuing existence is confirmed; they are "delivered" from the people who would rather have killed them (cf. v. 18). Their role among the Israelites is now described as "altar" service, using the distinctive language of Deuteronomy, "in the place that he should choose"81—an anticipation of Jerusalem, but at this point referring to anyplace the Lord's altar might be. This is further considered below in our evaluation of the Gibeonite covenant.

#### <span id="page-408-4"></span>*Excursus on Joshua 9:1–27*

Three questions bearing on a response to this passage have been deferred until the narrative could be seen as a whole. With the commentary above in mind, these questions can now be tackled.

#### WHO ACTS FOR ISRAEL?

At various points in this episode different parties speak for and act on behalf of Israel: (1) the "men of Israel," possibly to be identified also with the "congregation"; (2) the "leaders" (Hb. *nesiʾim*) of the congregation; and (3) Joshua himself.

<span id="page-408-5"></span><span id="page-408-3"></span><span id="page-408-2"></span>Four things are noteworthy here. (1) The "elders," who took a significant leading role throughout the Achan/Ai episode (in lament, 7:6; in mustering Israel, 8:10; in the covenant renewal, 8:33), are absent. The reason for this absence is a matter for speculation, but, given the general failure of alertness in this episode, the absence is regrettable. (2) It is difficult to know whether to correlate the "men of Israel" (9:6, 7, 14) with the people as a whole or with those later designated as "leaders" (vv. 15, 18). (3) Joshua's two interventions seem to be derivative and secondary; in both instances they are a reaction to a situation already unfolding, or perhaps even unraveling. (4) The "leaders of the congregation" take unusual initiative, as they appear as active agents only here in Joshua.82 The "leaders of the congregation"

<span id="page-408-7"></span><sup>81</sup> This phrase is used twenty-three times in the OT, with all but two instances being found in Deuteronomy

<span id="page-408-0"></span><sup>12–31.</sup> Elsewhere it is used only at Joshua 9:27 and at Nehemiah 1:9.

<span id="page-408-11"></span><sup>82</sup> They also appear in a list at Joshua 22:30.

<span id="page-409-2"></span><span id="page-409-1"></span>appear several times in the exodus narratives (Ex. 16:22; Num. 4:34; 31:13; 32:2), typically acting in concert with Moses. Numbers 31 is notable as another occasion on which inappropriate leniency is shown to enemies of Israel. On that instance, the aftermath of the Baal of Peor episode, the leaders join Moses in confronting the military commanders at fault.

This summary suggests that the line of command in Israel is somewhat confused, with both its strategic and its spiritual instincts occluded. Perhaps the most concerning of these elements is the role of Joshua. In light of his failure of judgment in the Achan/Ai episode, one would hope for increased vigilance. Here, however, we find another lapse of judgment; this will emerge again as the distribution of the land unfolds later in the book (Joshua 13–19). The criticism leveled via the unusual intrusion of the narrator's voice in Joshua 9:14 appears to be directed to the "men [of Israel]," but the fact that the very next verse relates Joshua's action as a consequence implicates him in their negligence.

<span id="page-409-11"></span><span id="page-409-10"></span><span id="page-409-8"></span>There is, then, something of a cautionary tale emerging as Joshua's leadership is subject to scrutiny (cf. Ps. 146:3). The first incremental steps toward the downward spiral that accelerates in the book of Judges have already been taken.

#### WHAT IS THE GIBEONITES' THEOLOGY?

Parallels between the Gibeonites and Rahab have often been observed. Rahab's confession was seen above to be quite a profound, even startling, expression of faith in the God of Israel, as its wording suggestively aligned her with Moses and Solomon (Josh. 2:9–11; cf. comments there).

<span id="page-409-7"></span><span id="page-409-4"></span>The outlook expressed by the Gibeonite representatives shares something of this character without achieving the depth of understanding that Rahab's words convey. Unlike Rahab's confession, made entirely before the arrangement and promise reached with the spies, the Gibeonites' confession comes in two stages, first in 9:9–10 and then again in verse 24. In both of these stages their self-account is given in response to questioning from Joshua, and both times it is embedded in their plea to be allied to Israel (in vv. 6, 11 regarding the "covenant" and again in v. 25 to be shown mercy). How these two confessions compare can be seen in tabular form (table 2.2).

<span id="page-409-6"></span><span id="page-409-3"></span>

| Shared Elements   | Rahab                                 | Gibeonites                     |

<span id="page-409-9"></span><span id="page-409-5"></span><span id="page-409-0"></span>TABLE 2.2: The Confessions of Rahab and the Gibeonites Compared

<span id="page-410-2"></span>Of the six shared elements, three align and three differ. The similarities are that both parties (1) name Israel's God by his covenant name, (2) know the essential political history of the exodus and the conquest of the Amorite kings Sihon and Og, and (3) express fear. The differences, however, are the following: (1) Whereas Rahab frames her confession in terms of personal knowledge, the Gibeonites point to an indirect report of unspecified origin, which they share. Their real reason remains the recent destruction of Jericho and Ai (9:3). (2) Whereas Rahab sees the land as in Yahweh's gift; the Gibeonites are a step removed, speaking simply of God's act and the command through Moses to destroy. (3) Tellingly, Rahab's statement reaches a climax with the recognition of Yahweh as "God of heaven and earth," an insight that places her in the company of Moses and Solomon; the Gibeonites' climactic statement is not about who God is but about their concern for their own self-preservation. The upshot of all this is that, while Rahab commits herself to Israel's God, the Gibeonites entrust themselves to Israel (9:25), or even to Israel's leader, Joshua.

<span id="page-410-3"></span>What does it matter that Gibeon's approach is less in recognition of who Israel's God is and more about self-preservation? Could it meet with the kind of divine favor that Rahab's alliance with Israel clearly did? There are connections here with the next question, regarding the status of the covenant itself. Provisionally, however, it appears that even self-interest arising from craven fear in combination with a lack of understanding of the character of Israel's God can lead in a good direction. It will shortly transpire that God appears to be so gracious that even base, self-interested fear, if it drives us to him, can be a foundation for a meaningful relationship with him.

#### HOW OUGHT WE REGARD THE GIBEONITE COVENANT?

The Gibeonites declare fear for their lives to be their starting point for seeking a covenant with Israel. In contrast to the common responses of fight, flight, or freeze—fight being the response of their Canaanite neighbors—the Gibeonites' avoidant action involves fraud. Their means of reducing fear is not to attempt battle and military conquest, subjecting Israel to them or destroying Israel and eradicating the source of danger, as is mostly the case (5:1; 9:1–2; 10:1–5; 11:1–5). Rather, they subject themselves to Israel, on whatever terms Israel will give (9:25). What they desire, though, is a "covenant," and that is what they get, even if on unattractive terms by the end of the chapter.

<span id="page-410-1"></span><span id="page-410-0"></span>How is this "covenant" to be evaluated? The case of Rahab creates a precedent, although the Gibeonite case is more complex than hers. Likewise, we have noted that some "sojourners" (or "aliens"; Hb. *gerim*) are included in Israel's covenant community (8:33, 35), and this too suggests a place for incorporating nonnatives into the covenant community. But the case of Gibeon itself requires taking a wider, although still selective, view of their place in biblical history. The following factors are relevant:

(1) The very next chapter of Joshua will demonstrate that the Gibeonite assumption—that Israel would respect any covenant forged between themis correct. The next phase of Israel's action in taking the Promised Land has as its foundation the very covenant with Gibeon, put into effect here under such apparently dubious circumstances.

<span id="page-411-2"></span>(2) During Saul's reign he apparently slaughtered Gibeonites, and this transgression of the covenant demanded the destruction of Saul's remaining offspring (Mephibosheth excepted) during the reign of David (2 Sam. 21:1–14). Saul's action is not recorded in the OT, but it has often been associated with the killing of the priests at Nob, for whom the Gibeonites were servants (1 Samuel 21–22).83 The Gibeonite covenant remained in force in David's day and demanded justice.

<span id="page-411-4"></span><span id="page-411-1"></span>(3) Gibeon was the scene of Solomon's dream in which the Lord gifted him with wisdom (1 Kings 3:4–15). The Chronicler (1 Chron. 16:39; 21:29) provides the additional information that the high place of Gibeon, said to be a favorite for sacrifice in 1 Kings 3:4, was also the home for the tabernacle, or at least a "tent sanctuary," providing it some status.84

<span id="page-411-3"></span>On balance, then, although there might be lingering qualms about the origins of the Gibeonite covenant, and a failure of vigilance on the part of Israel and (particularly) its leaders can be discerned from their making it, nonetheless this covenant became the basis for their continued existence among the people of God.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-411-0"></span>Jerome Creach asks the pertinent question of this passage: "To whom is Joshua 9 good news?"85 It is good news, first of all, to those who, like the Gibeonites, believe they face destruction from this God of Israel. Although the approach the Gibeonites initiate is flawed, the outcome is clear: they live. And not only that, for they will go on to receive both protection and justice within the covenant community and from their covenant God. There is a contrast here with Rahab. She harbored Israel's spies, at least; the only thing Gibeon did for Israel was to feed them stale bread—and this only to promote their deception! Like Rahab, however, even if on a basis less "deserving," the Gibeonites realized they did not need to be destroyed but could in fact find hope and a future in submitting to the God of Israel.

<span id="page-411-6"></span><span id="page-411-5"></span>Joshua 9 is also good news to those who, like the Israelites, believe that God's preferred option is destruction. And yet, on certain terms this God is willing for his word to "come false" rather than true. Both the OT (Ezek. 18:23, 32; 33:11) and the NT (2 Pet. 3:9) assure us that the Lord does not wish that "any should perish, but that all should reach repentance." The much later example of God's reaction to Ninevite repentance in the book of Jonah is one of the clearest examples of this lavish grace of the God of Israel.

There is also good news here for those whose reliance on this God has wavered and who have lived without reference to their sovereign Lord. Joshua 9 does not

give blithe permission to ignore seeking the will of God, nor does it justify being a muddled believer. But it does testify again to the truth that human failure cannot thwart God's good designs.

### <span id="page-412-0"></span>JOSHUA 10:1–28

10 As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction,*<sup>1</sup>* doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, **2**he*<sup>2</sup>* feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors. **<sup>3</sup>** So Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, **<sup>4</sup>** "Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel." **5**Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.

**<sup>6</sup>**And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, "Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us." **<sup>7</sup>** So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. **8**And the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you." **<sup>9</sup>** So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal. **10**And the Lord threw them into a panic before Israel, who*<sup>3</sup>* struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. **11**And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the Lord threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.

**<sup>12</sup>**At that time Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,

"Sun, stand still at Gibeon,

and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon."

**<sup>13</sup>** And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,

until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.

Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day. **14**There has been

no day like it before or since, when the Lord heeded the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.

**<sup>15</sup>** So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

**<sup>16</sup>**These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. **<sup>17</sup>**And it was told to Joshua, "The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah." **18**And Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them, **19**but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the Lord your God has given them into your hand." **20**When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, **<sup>21</sup>** then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.

**<sup>22</sup>**Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave." **23**And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. **24**And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings." Then they came near and put their feet on their necks. **25**And Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight." **26**And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening. **27**But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.

**<sup>28</sup>**As for Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-413-1"></span><span id="page-413-0"></span>Whatever conclusions we might draw concerning the covenant made with the Gibeonites, one thing remains clear: it is this event that finally plunges Israel into the sequence of battles in which they will claim God's gift of the Promised Land. Up to this point they have made a set of small steps probing its central region, still quite near their base of Gilgal, between Jericho and the River Jordan. But the Gibeonite covenant triggers a coalition of five kings in the central-southern region to make war against Israel. The result of this campaign will be a further push into the cities deeper to the south and west (10:29–43), and success in those battles sparks a similar coalition of kings in the cities in the north (11:1–5). Israel's campaign passes its early, hesitant phase and finally gathers momentum, and the

<span id="page-414-8"></span>covenant with Gibeon is the fulcrum. We find a similar dynamic in the spreading of the early church recounted in Acts. The apostles lingered for some time in the environs of Jerusalem before a "great persecution" arose in the wake of Stephen's execution that "scattered" the Christians (Acts 8:1–4), so that Jesus' commission was finally being fulfilled to be his witnesses not only "in Jerusalem" but also "in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8).

<span id="page-414-7"></span><span id="page-414-2"></span><span id="page-414-1"></span>The central campaign comprises two distinct stages. The first part has as its focal point the action against Gibeon (Josh. 10:1–15). Once the coalition formed at the initiative of the king of Jerusalem takes action (vv. 1–5), the Gibeonites respond with a plea to their covenant partners to come to their aid. Israel then acts on behalf of Gibeon, delivering the city from its enemies and securing its environs. The narrator shapes Israel's own actions as moving from and returning to Gilgal (vv. 6–15). This battle includes one of the most dramatic and mysterious of God's interventions on behalf of Israel, as at one point "the sun stopped in the midst of heaven" (v. 13).

<span id="page-414-5"></span><span id="page-414-4"></span><span id="page-414-3"></span>During the rout of Gibeon's enemies, however, the coalition kings flee. The account of their pursuit and execution is narrated in the second stage of this passage, still as a consequence of involvement with Gibeon (vv. 16–28). These were the kings responsible for making war on Israel; like other hostile kings that both precede and follow them, they learn the truth of Psalm 2 in their own fates.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-414-0"></span>10:1–5 Gibeon is not the only neighbor to react to the destruction of Ai. But the peace with Gibeon makes an even greater impact on Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem. Both his name and his city deserve notice. As for the city, this is the first mention of Jerusalem in the Bible. It is striking that the city that will be the place at which the Lord will choose "put his name and make his habitation" (Deut. 12:5) is, at the moment of its first appearance in the biblical story, hostile to the invading Israelites and their God. The place will be transformed as well as its people. The king's name, meaning "the Lord of righteousness" or "my Lord is righteous,"

<span id="page-415-13"></span>is very close to the name of the first king engaged in battle by Israel in the book of Judges, Adoni-bezek, who is also associated with Jerusalem (Judg. 1:5–7).

<span id="page-415-6"></span><span id="page-415-5"></span>Gibeon's initiative in seeking peace with Israel confronts Adoni-zedek with a dilemma. The defeat of Jericho and Ai would be cause enough for alarm. But, as Joshua 10:2 clarifies, the status and prowess of Gibeon were on a different scale than Ai's—and yet they sought terms from Israel rather than confronting them in battle. It is this, rather than the military conquests, that makes Adoni-zedek "fear greatly." What is he to do? Rather than capitulate, he outnumbers the Gibeonite tetrapolis (cf. 9:17) and gathers a coalition of five cities: Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. They fan out to the southwest of Jerusalem,86 thus placing themselves even farther from Gibeon, which lies just less than 6 miles (9.7 km) to the north of Jerusalem. It is telling that the circumstance he announces in his summons to the four kings is that Gibeon has "made peace" and is the target of their aggression, rather than pointing to the defeat of Ai or Jericho and coming against Joshua and Israel. The coalition is formed and lays siege to Gibeon, chief city of the tetrapolis.

<span id="page-415-7"></span><span id="page-415-4"></span><span id="page-415-2"></span><span id="page-415-1"></span>10:6–8 The summons issued by Adoni-zedek in verses 3–4 finds a close counterpart in the Gibeonite response of verse 6. As the king of Jerusalem "sent" to his allies (v. 3), so too do the Gibeonites to theirs. The terms of their requests are shifted: whereas Adoni-zedek's plea is to "come up . . . help . . . and let us strike" (v. 4), the Gibeonite request to Joshua is for Israel to "come up to us quickly and save us and help us." The demands of the covenant agreement mean not only Israel's preservation of Gibeon but also the latter's salvation.

<span id="page-415-11"></span><span id="page-415-9"></span><span id="page-415-8"></span><span id="page-415-3"></span>Joshua's response is immediate, marching the army of Israel to Gibeon (v. 7). Given the preceding history, one might wonder whether some attempt to seek God's guidance would have been prudent; the absence of such an inclination has proved damaging to Israel's standing before the Lord previously. However, the reassurance comes in verse 8, in forthright terms. The formula "Not a man of them shall stand . . ." is a distinctive divine assurance in the book of Joshua, occurring again at 21:44 as confirmation of the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and at 23:9 as Joshua himself reflects on God's faithfulness.87 On this occasion, then, Joshua has discerned rightly: fidelity to the covenant with Gibeon requires this response on Israel's part. God's reassurance of victory, however, is not so much corroboration of good judgment as confirmation that Israel's progress into the Promised Land is to move forward.

<span id="page-415-12"></span><span id="page-415-10"></span>10:9–11 Israel's rapid mobilization takes place at night. Its remarkable nocturnal march from Gilgal provides an element of surprise as it encounters the coalition forces the next morning at Gibeon. Israel does not act alone, however. Just as Joshua's initiative of verse 7 meets with divine partnership in verse 8, so again

<span id="page-415-14"></span><span id="page-415-0"></span><sup>86</sup> Of these four Jarmuth is closest to Jerusalem, roughly 16 miles (26 km) west-southwest, while Lachish and Eglon—if correctly identified with Tel ʾEton—are farthest, about 26 miles (43 km) southwest of Jerusalem. 87 These are the only three uses of this formula as a promise; variations are also found in Deuteronomy 7:24 and Esther 9:2, the only other occurrences in the Hebrew Bible.

<span id="page-416-3"></span>the Israelite action of verse 9 as they engage in combat with the enemies of the Gibeonites—now also their enemies—is matched by the intervention of the divine warrior, who makes here the first of three actions on Israel's behalf in this battle. The Lord brings panic into the ranks of the coalition at the same time Israel "struck them with a great blow" (v. 10). The very thing that Adoni-zedek sought to inflict on Gibeon with the help of his allies (v. 4) Israel inflicts on the coalition as they come to the aid of their covenant partner.

<span id="page-416-5"></span><span id="page-416-4"></span><span id="page-416-2"></span><span id="page-416-1"></span><span id="page-416-0"></span>The coalition warriors flee, with Israel in pursuit (vv. 10–11). Their route takes them to the north of the Gibeonite tetrapolis before veering south in the general direction of Jarmuth. And just as at the battle's inception, so again during the flight and pursuit are the actions of Israel supported by the intervention of the divine warrior. While Israelite swords work, so too does divine hail, first described as "large stones." Hail (Hb. *barad*) stirs memory of the seventh plague God brought against Egypt (Ex. 9:13–35); both the hail in Egypt and the hail in this battle are destructive (cf. Ex. 9:19, 25) and selective (Ex. 9:26), striking down the Egyptians and Canaanites but in neither case touching the Israelites. More widely, hail is very much part of the divine arsenal, celebrated as such in Psalm 18:13–14, announced as such in the theophany of Job 38:22–23, and wielded by the Lord also against Assyria in Isaiah 30:30–31. While the origins of the panicked confusion the Lord threw on the fleeing coalition might have been difficult to discern, the torrent of destructive hail is much more clearly the action of the divine warrior.

<span id="page-416-11"></span><span id="page-416-10"></span><span id="page-416-9"></span><span id="page-416-8"></span><span id="page-416-7"></span><span id="page-416-6"></span>10:12–14 The third of the Lord's interventions in this battle is by far the most dramatic, and the most famous. We have seen at least one celestial phenomenon of note in this episode, the cataclysmic fall of hail; there might have been another, if the light of the moon assisted Israel's nighttime march from Gilgal to Gibeon. The climax of dramatic celestial signs comes in these verses, as the "sun stood still, and the moon stopped" (Josh. 10:13) in response to Joshua's cry (v. 12). The preservation of the prayer and reply in poetry, along with the reference to the "Book of Jashar" (known otherwise only from a similar remark introducing David's lament over Saul and Jonathan; 2 Sam. 1:18), further evokes a sense of mystery that is already roused by the astonishing and awesome event itself. Attempts to provide some explanation for the miracle either look to natural phenomena that might explain the account, such as an eclipse, or appeal to parallels from ancient Near Eastern literature that provide the event some religious or cultural context.88 All such explanations evacuate the event of its primary meaning. Calvin remarked that "the question of how the sun stood still in Gibeon is no less unseasonably raised by some than unskillfully explained by others." The editor of the nineteenth-century English edition of Calvin astutely remarks, "The rebuke here administered to those who attempt to explain the miracle applies with double force to those who attempt to explain it away."89 The fundamental point to be

made to any who seeks to rationalize the miracle is that, in any case, explanation of mechanism is not the same as explanation of meaning. For example, explaining the biological processes involved in a mother's giving birth does not explain the meaning of a human life.

<span id="page-417-9"></span><span id="page-417-3"></span>The point concerning Gibeon is made with some force by the narrator in Joshua 10:14 regarding the incomparability of this day: "for the Lord fought for Israel." More helpful, then, is the parallel in the prayer of Habakkuk 3:11, which describes how "the sun and moon stood still in their place at the light of your arrows as they sped." There, like here, the heavenly bodies are subject to the one who made them; God's own "weapons" take precedence.90 It has further been observed that this intervention by God—indeed, all three of them (the confusion, the hail, and the longest day)—were not strictly required in military terms. Israel's army is well on its way to victory.91 The narrator's brief but pointed summary, repeated again at Joshua 10:42, when all the events set in train by the Gibeonite covenant have been concluded, remains the essential one: the Lord fights for Israel.

<span id="page-417-8"></span><span id="page-417-4"></span>10:15 Gilgal remains Israel's base of operations, in spite of the distant pursuit of the Jerusalem coalition. Although Gibeon has been secured, their enemies remain at large. For the moment, however, Israel rests. This may seem an unusual pause. As action resumes in the succeeding verses, Israel is back in the environs north of Jarmuth, where the dramatic events in the valley of Aijalon took place. Whether we are dealing with a narrative like that of chapters 3–4, which does not unfold in strict chronological order, or whether this conveys the movements of Israel in the campaign, is difficult to determine.

<span id="page-417-6"></span><span id="page-417-5"></span><span id="page-417-0"></span>10:16–21 Attention reverts to the five kings of the coalition who seek to evade capture by hiding themselves in "the cave at Makkedah." It may be that this is a known site ("*the* cave"), as the question arises why the kings should shelter here rather than in their own fortified cities. The simplest explanation is that they are on the run from Israel; as verse 19 suggests, the battle persists in the field. Joshua's strategy is to deal with the enemy while it is exposed and not protected by its fortifications, much as he learned to do in the successful battle against Ai (ch. 8). Makkedah is about halfway between Lachish and Hebron, just north of Eglon (if it is to be identified with Tel ʾEton).

<span id="page-417-7"></span><span id="page-417-2"></span><span id="page-417-1"></span>Before attending to the kings, however, Israel must bring its action against the coalition armies to a conclusion (10:20). The Hebrew is curiously emphatic in describing the finality of Israel's defeat of the coalition. The "great blow" (cf. v. 10) Israel inflicts is framed by two terms conveying completion and finishing, the latter in a phrase that often implies something done to death (Hb. *ʿad-tumam*). But it is curious in the sense that some refugees manage to escape back to their fortified cities. That some element of life is left is clear also from the later story

<sup>90</sup> Cf. Creach, *Joshua*, 92.

<span id="page-418-6"></span><span id="page-418-5"></span>of Caleb, which involves taking the city of Hebron (14:13–15; cf. also Debir, 10:38–39; 15:15).

<span id="page-418-1"></span><span id="page-418-0"></span>Earlier in the Joshua narrative, especially around the crossing of the Jordan, we saw numerous parallels that aligned the entry of Israel into the Promised Land with the departure of the exodus generation from Egypt under Moses. One of the last of these in Joshua is encountered here in the defeat of the Jerusalem coalition. As the defeat of their armies is completed, the narrator records: "Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel" (Josh. 10:21). This is an evocative description of the regard in which the populace holds Israel. More than that, the Hebrew idiom "cut [the] tongue" (*harats* + *lashon*) means "snarl" (cf. NJPS). It occurs only one other time in the Hebrew Bible. In Exodus 11:7 Moses is instructing the people concerning the final plague of death to the firstborn of Egypt and the lamentation it will arouse: "Not a dog shall growl against any of the people of Israel, either man or beast, that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel." So here in Joshua, not a man "growls" against Israel. The lesson that Moses applied in Egypt should also be understood here in the conquest context. The Lord is making a distinction between the Amorite kings, and their armies, and Israel. The scenes about to unfold are among the bloodiest of the book. And yet, as this distinction is drawn, the fact that this engagement has been provoked by the coalition on account of Gibeon's peace with Israel implies that it need not have been so.

<span id="page-418-3"></span><span id="page-418-2"></span>10:22–27 As the fate of the kings draws near, again they are patiently enumerated. A somewhat strange ceremony now unfolds, as Joshua instructs the "chiefs of the men of war" (Josh. 10:24) to place their feet on the necks of the five kings. This sort of ritual humiliation finds parallels in the ancient Near East. Of several examples of victorious kings' treading down their vanquished foes, perhaps the closest parallel to this moment is found in an inscription of Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1244–1208), who declared regarding Kashtiliash IV (c. 1242–1235) of Babylon: "I placed my feet upon his lordly neck as a footstool."92 God is speaking to and through Joshua and to the Israelites in a language that Bronze Age people would understand.

<span id="page-418-7"></span><span id="page-418-4"></span>In these circumstances Joshua's further encouragement to his chiefs to "not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous" (v. 25) may seem obvious enough. Although the positive and negative pairs of these verbs appear often enough, only in Chronicles is the combination of all four found again. On two occasions these are the terms in which David encourages Solomon to be faithful in constructing the temple and arranging its worship (1 Chron. 22:13; 28:20). Likewise, Hezekiah rallies the people of Jerusalem as preparations are made to face the Assyrians by declaring, "There are more with us than with him. With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us and to fight our battles" (2 Chron. 32:7–8). There is an element here of summons to simple, physical courage in the face of temptation to be cowed or craven. But more than that, and perhaps predominantly,

<span id="page-418-10"></span><span id="page-418-9"></span><span id="page-418-8"></span><sup>92</sup> F.J. Stendebach, "לֶג ֶר, "*TDOT*, 13:312. Further symbolic parallels are found in David's enemies' falling under his feet (Ps. 18:38) and in Psalm 110:1, "The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool'" (quoted by Jesus, Matt. 22:44ff.; cf. Heb. 1:13).

is a further spiritual dimension to be obedient to the claims of service owed to the sovereign Lord, who fights with and for his people.

<span id="page-419-6"></span><span id="page-419-2"></span>The execution of the five kings, their exposure, and the final disposition of the corpses follows the pattern of the treatment of the king of Ai (Josh. 10:26–27; cf. 8:29), and, as on that occasion, the strictures of Deuteronomy 21:22–23 are followed. The close alignment of this sequence with the Deuteronomic law implies the fulfillment of the conditions for that law to be enacted—a sin ("crime") "punishable by death" (Deut. 21:22)—and further brings a recognition of the judgment of that sin on the victim: "for a hanged man is cursed by God" (Deut. 21:23; cf. Num. 25:4). As in the other cases of stone memorials in Joshua, the site serves to maintain the community's memory.

<span id="page-419-7"></span><span id="page-419-5"></span><span id="page-419-3"></span><span id="page-419-1"></span><span id="page-419-0"></span>10:28 The city of Makkedah brackets this subsection, which began at Joshua 10:16. Its king is likewise executed and the city subject to *kherem*, with Jericho cited as the precedent. Although *kherem* has not been prominent in the immediately preceding chapters, it now returns to the forefront of the narrator's account. As such, this verse also serves as a transition to the sequence that follows in verses 29–39 (cf. comment there), each successive conquest resonating with this account of Makkedah.

#### <span id="page-419-8"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-419-4"></span>This episode is deliberately framed in terms of the activities and fate of the "five kings" of the coalition who come together at the behest of the king of Jerusalem (10:5, 16, 26). Although the first inclination of Christian readers to passages such as this one (and those that follow) is to ask who is on the Lord's side, the frame of the story puts the opposite question with urgency: what of those opposed to the Lord's side? As the writer to the Hebrews states, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:31). As noted above, strong parallels are evident between the fate of these five kings and the king of Ai. Like him, their primary opponent is the God of heaven and earth, the God of Israel—not Joshua, not Israel, and certainly not Gibeon in the case of this coalition.

<span id="page-419-10"></span><span id="page-419-9"></span>Within that frame the narrative brings two kinds of fighting to the fore. In the first phase God fights for Israel—as well as for Gibeon. Whatever qualms we might have about the way in which the Gibeonites entered into a covenant with Israel, God at any rate regards it as a genuine relationship. There is such a thing as failing to enter by the "Wicket Gate," in terms of Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress* (cf. Matt. 7:13–14), but perhaps entry through that gate can take place in what we might think are unusual ways. And so three times the divine warrior fights with his people against his enemy and, in the case of the hail, accounts for greater enemy losses. The Westminster Shorter Catechism speaks to this situation.

Question 26. How doth Christ execute the office of a king? Answer: Christ executeth the office of a king, in subduing us to himself, in ruling and defending us, and in restraining and conquering all his and our enemies.

<span id="page-420-1"></span><span id="page-420-0"></span>In the second phase Israel fights for God. The kind prominence of divine action seen in Joshua 10:6–14 does not continue as the rest of the battle unfolds. Yet God is not therefore absent. Rather, Joshua understands the meaning of God's plain words (v. 8) as demonstrated in those three interventions. This becomes the basis for his urging Israel to complete the battle (v. 19). Israel is growing in its understanding of obedience and of the nature of the sovereignty of the God its serve.

<span id="page-420-4"></span><span id="page-420-2"></span>Christian readers may well discern a trajectory to a very different king in Jerusalem, who would bear divine wrath rather than provoke it and be exposed on a stake, entombed in a cave, and barricaded behind a stone—but neither stone nor death could hold that king, whom God highly exalted and on whom he bestowed the name at which every knee should bow (cf. Phil. 2:8–10).

### <span id="page-420-3"></span>JOSHUA 10:29–43

**<sup>29</sup>**Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. **30**And the Lord gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.

**<sup>31</sup>**Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it. **32**And the Lord gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.

**<sup>33</sup>**Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.

**<sup>34</sup>**Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it. **35**And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.

**<sup>36</sup>**Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it **<sup>37</sup>** and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.

**<sup>38</sup>**Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it **<sup>39</sup>** and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.

**<sup>40</sup>** So Joshua struck the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and

the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but devoted to destruction all that breathed, just as the Lord God of Israel commanded. **41**And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon. **42**And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel. **43**Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-421-1"></span>The summary of the defeat of Makkedah in Joshua 10:28 sets the tone for a campaign onward in the southern region. While the armies of the Jerusalem coalition were defeated in the field, the fortified cities still have not been conquered, and three of those cities form part of the ensuing campaign; Jarmuth and Jerusalem itself do not feature in this list, while Libnah and Debir are included. A strong shared pattern is seen among the accounts of the defeat of the five cities (six, if one counts Gezer, which joins in of its own accord; v. 33) against which Joshua leads Israel. The shared elements do not appear in each of the five segments, but patterns emerge. Rather than dealing with each city in turn, then, the comments below tease out the patterns and draw attention to the salient features for interpretation.

The regularity of the contents can also be expressed in tabular form (table 2.3), here including Makkedah from the previous section (v. 28).93 The rows represent each of the cities conquered; the numerical sequence in the row is the order in which the various elements are found for that city. It can immediately be seen how much Makkedah participates in this scheme, even while it is related back to verse 16. No two cities share the same pattern, although Hebron and Debir come closest to each other.

<span id="page-421-2"></span>10:29–39 The southern campaign takes place as a consequence of the battle in defense of Gibeon and the subsequent pursuit of the coalition army toward its regional heartland. Libnah is only about 8 miles (12.9 km) north-northwest of Makkedah; Lachish is only 6 miles (9.7 km) south-southeast of Libnah. This is the

<span id="page-422-0"></span>TABLE 2.3: The City Reports of the Southern Campaign

*Note:* Column headings are as follows: (A) Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from . . . (\* Hebron "went up"; Debir "turned back"); (B) PN1 to PN2 (\* PN1 only); (C) struck with the edge of the sword (\* Gezer "struck" only); (D) fought against; (E) laid siege; (F) the Lord gave . . . into the hand of Israel; (G) captured; (H) devoted to destruction (*kherem*); (I) every person in it; (J) he left none remaining; (K) he did to . . . ; (L) just as he had done . . . ; and (M) (a) [did] to king, (b) [did] to king and towns.

<span id="page-422-2"></span>point at which the force from Gezer joins the fray. It is difficult to know why, as the report (v. 33) is very sparse. Gezer is over 20 miles (32 km) to the north of Lachish. Eglon, Hebron, and Debir are all farther to the east and south.

Clearly much is shared between the five (six, if Makkedah is included) reports of city destruction, although no one report includes all the elements shared between them. Of the thirteen features, six are common to each report: (1) the formulaic that "Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from . . . ," which sets the trajectory to the next city; (2) "fought against" (Makkedah is not part of this sequence); (3) the two place names (PN) as links in the chain, except Makkedah and Debir (first and last), where the name of that city alone appears; (4) that they were "struck . . . with the . . . sword"; (5) that this fate came to "every person in it"; and (6) a back reference to previous action in the phrase "as he had done . . ." A seventh feature, the notice that "he left none remaining," is missing only from the Eglon report. In spite of the irregularities, a significant amount of overlap remains.

<span id="page-422-4"></span><span id="page-422-3"></span><span id="page-422-1"></span>One of the striking aspects of these connected accounts is the way in which insistent and inclusive language of total extermination only partially intersects with the language of *kherem*. The immediate import of this is not to distinguish Libnah and Lachish as in some way not being subject to *kherem* but rather to observe that in each case the total annihilation called for in Deuteronomy 7 has been inflicted by Israel under Joshua's leadership. From the perspective of Deuteronomy, this bespeaks the obedience of Israel to the terms in which God set out for their inheritance of the Promised Land. Subtler is the observation that a number of these cities will be encountered again in the next part of the book or in Judges. The observation has been made that "the Joshua narrative elsewhere describes how there were quite a few local inhabitants left; see e.g. 11:22; 13:1–7; 15:63."94 While registering this datum does not soften the rhetoric of destruction in this passage, it nonetheless alerts modern readers to the presence of some hyperbole in the account.

<span id="page-423-2"></span>Certain of the infrequent features remain noteworthy. Of only two cities, Libnah and Lachish, do we read that "the Lord gave it . . . into the hand of Israel" (Josh. 10:30, 32). Since the overarching theological import of the narrative is that "the Lord fought for Israel" (vv. 14, 42), perhaps persistent reiteration is unneeded in the individual reports of the cities conquered—but this only makes the cases of Libnah and Lachish a little more odd: why *these* two? We cannot say with certainty. It is noteworthy, though, that this mention comes in the first two cities beyond Makkedah. If it is right to discern the gradual withdrawal of the Lord from overt involvement in battle, then the training has its intended effect, as the remaining cities are likewise captured by Israel. Another feature occurs only twice: a "siege" is employed in the warfare against the cities of Lachish and Eglon. The impression left by the sequence of reports is of a very rapid conquest, carrying on the momentum of the preceding section's narrative of the pursuit of the coalition army. Pausing for siege warfare would seem like an impediment to the flow, except for the notices in only these two cases of how long the engagement lasts: Lachish is captured on day two of the siege (v. 32) and Eglon apparently on the first day (v. 35). These are very short sieges!

<span id="page-423-4"></span><span id="page-423-3"></span>The oddity of Gezer's involvement (v. 33) was noted above. It is also significant that the city itself is not here engaged or overthrown. It was well outside the line of march of the Israelite army, at least at this time. Although Gezer is located in the northern Shephelah, and thus part of what might be thought of as the territory of Judah, it persists under Canaanite control (cf. Judg. 1:29) at least until the time of Solomon (1 Kings 9:16).

<span id="page-423-9"></span><span id="page-423-8"></span><span id="page-423-7"></span><span id="page-423-6"></span><span id="page-423-5"></span>10:40–43 The final summary emphasizes the rapid success of Israel under Joshua (Josh 10:42) and sketches the boundaries of the territory represented by these conquests: basically, from the line of Gibeon south to northern reaches of the Sinai (Kadesh-barnea) and east-west from the coastal plain to Israel's base at Gilgal. This is an extensive region, suggesting much greater reach than would be accounted for by the conquered cities and their hinterland alone. Beside this geographical attention, we also find a theological assessment. The conjunction of the application of *kherem* and obedience to the word of the Lord is now made explicit (v. 40). Israel's obedience meets with covenant blessing (cf. Lev. 26:7–8), as the notice first encountered at Joshua 10:14, ("the Lord fought for Israel") is again repeated (v. 42). Even if the Lord is receding from prominence in terms of narrative attention, it is clear that the actions of Israel undertaken obediently find a counterpart in the empowering action of the divine warrior.

#### <span id="page-423-1"></span><span id="page-423-0"></span>*Response*

The elements recurring through this conquest account bring into the foreground the essential features for Israel's actions, the Canaanite destruction, and God's <span id="page-424-1"></span>intentions. For Joshua and Israel the emphasis falls on their obedience and its consistency. The lessons of chapter 7 have been learned; this is a people who now fights fittingly. This must account for the repetition of the inclusive elements throughout the accounts ("every person," "left none remaining"); not only is the destruction total but so too is Israel's obedience in carrying out God's commands. The consistency is seen in the "just as" statements that typically refer back to the preceding site, so that the individual accounts are framed with a backward glance (the "went up from" element with toponyms) and a present update. Each of these cities, joined in opposition to Israel and Israel's God, suffers the same fate.

<span id="page-424-4"></span>The use of *kherem* reaches something of a crescendo in this passage. There are five occurrences in the space of these verses; the only other passage in Joshua that rivals this density is the Achan episode of chapter 7, where it is not application of the *kherem* that is in view but Israel's failure to observe the demands of *kherem*, leading to its moment of military collapse. Now, in the southern campaign, *kherem* is consistently observed. Perhaps this represents Israel's carrying out in conquest something God himself performed in exodus, with the final plague bringing death to those Egyptians hardened against the purposes of God. (This will be signaled more clearly in Josh. 11:20; cf. comment on 11:16–20) This does not set a precedent, and certainly not a pattern, for the actions of God's people in time to come: *kherem* will fade away. It persists briefly into Judges, but such is the decline of God's people that by Judges 21:11 it comes tragically to be applied internally in Israel. It is last employed in the destruction of the Amalekites under Saul, in the transition to rule by kings (1 Samuel 15). Here in Joshua *kherem* is carried out against those cities that have chosen to oppose the purpose of God through an attack on those most recently brought into covenant relationship with him: the Gibeonites.

<span id="page-424-6"></span><span id="page-424-5"></span><span id="page-424-2"></span>Another prominent aspect of these accounts (omitted from Lachish and Eglon) is the attention given to kings, with reference back twice to the king of Jericho as the series begins. Is it merely a coincidence that the one great city said not to be "royal," Gibeon (Josh. 10:2), is the one to seek peace with Joshua? The suggestion has been made that, as Rahab finds a counterpart in Achan, so too the Gibeonites find their counterparts in these kings opposed to the rule of Israel's God.95 The contrast here is not between outsider-turned-insider and insider-turned-outsider but rather between nonroyals who (rightly) seek servitude and royals who (wrongly) assert sovereignty. The evident pride of kings seems to escalate when the greatest of the royal cities to the north reacts to these events in chapter 11. As biblical royal theology asserts, kings rule well only when their rule is subject to the King of kings (Deut. 17:18–20; 1 Sam. 12:13–15; Ps. 72:1–4) and when they reflect his kingship faithfully (cf. Isa. 33:22; Jer. 23:5–6). Ultimately the tension between the royal pretensions of kings of the earth and the royal rule of God will be resolved only when he himself takes on human flesh and is exalted to the heavenly throne (Ezek. 34:14, 24; cf. Rev. 7:15–17).

11 When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, **<sup>2</sup>** and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west, **<sup>3</sup>** to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. **4**And they came out with all their troops, a great horde, in number like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. **5**And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.

**6**And the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire." **<sup>7</sup>** So Joshua and all his warriors came suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them. **8**And the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining. **9**And Joshua did to them just as the Lord said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

**<sup>10</sup>**And Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms. **11**And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction;*<sup>1</sup>* there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire. **12**And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. **13**But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; that Joshua burned. **14**And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every person they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed. **<sup>15</sup>** Just as the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses.

**<sup>16</sup>** So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland **<sup>17</sup>** from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death. **<sup>18</sup>** Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. **19**There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle. **20**For it was the Lord's doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, just as the Lord commanded Moses.

**<sup>21</sup>**And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities. **22**There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod did some remain. **<sup>23</sup>** So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-426-3"></span><span id="page-426-2"></span><span id="page-426-1"></span><span id="page-426-0"></span>The broad resonances of the account of the northern campaign with the southern are readily apparent. A coalition is formed at the behest of the king of the leading city in the region, whose armies march out as aggressors against Israel (11:1–5). Battle is joined in the field, and with divine reassurance and assistance Joshua and the army of Israel rout the enemy (vv. 6–9). With the defeat of the armies, the cities of the coalition themselves are defeated by Israel (vv. 10–15). All of this in broad outline echoes what has taken place in the south, recounted in chapter 10. Here the account includes some narrative features that give this episode the feeling of a climax; even so, it is much more compact than chapter 10. The exact makeup of the coalition is vaguer than the one formed by the king of Jerusalem. The various battles are still situated in the landscape, as in the account of the southern campaign, but with less detail and precision. Both accounts make theological observation, but this takes on greater prominence in the northern campaign.

<span id="page-426-4"></span>The work of the narrator is cumulative, as the summary now attached to the northern campaign (11:16–20) looks back also to the southern and central regions in giving an overview of all the territory taken since the first encounter with Jericho. The practice of combining geographical and theological overview seen in earlier summaries is found again here. This is itself a further signal of the deep interconnection between God, place, and people in biblical theology.

<span id="page-426-5"></span>The brief notice of the encounter with and destruction of the Anakim is somewhat enigmatic (vv. 21–22). Outside the territorial operations of Israel, yet integrated by the narrator as a last gasp of this opening phase of the book, the Anakim represent a foe of a different kind than the cities of Canaan who have come together to fight Israel.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-427-4"></span><span id="page-427-2"></span><span id="page-427-0"></span>11:1–5 Israel's victories over the kings of the southern region now provoke northern aggression. Another "Jabin, king of Hazor" is later encountered in the war of Deborah and Barak in Judges 4:2, much as Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem in Joshua 10:1 finds an echo in Adoni-bezek of Judges 1:6–7. A cuneiform tablet containing a letter to an "Ibni-[Adad?]" found at Hazor in 1991–1992 excavations at that site adds credence to the notion that "Jabin" was a royal dynastic name at Hazor.

<span id="page-427-1"></span>The name Ibni-Adad is the Akkadian form of the West Semitic name Yabni-Hadad, of which the name Jabin, king of Hazor (Josh. 11.1; Judg. 4.2), is a possible linguistic derivation. The Jabin referred to in the books of Joshua and Judges postdates Ibni-Adad of the Mari archive by more than 500 years, indicating that the name must have been a dynastic name, borne by more than one of the kings of Hazor.96

Hazor itself remains an impressive site, its large extent and massive fortifications bearing witness to its power and status during the Bronze Age.97 Excavations in the 2010s yielded further cuneiform texts that demonstrated how Hazor even operated its own legal system—a sign of its elite status.98 Hazor's role in forming a northern coalition is in keeping with this regional prominence and status.

The precise locations of the first three cities summoned are all disputed, although some identifications have a greater degree of likelihood than others; the names of Madon and Shimron also have textual variants. The trajectory described by these place names lies to the southwest of Hazor: Madon about 16 miles (26 km) to the south, just west of modern Tiberias; Shimron about 30 miles (48 km) away on the northern edge of the valley of Jezreel; and Achshaph roughly 26 miles (42 km) west-southwest in the plain of Acco, just over 4 miles (7 km) from the Mediterranean coast.99 The cascading regional designations and gentilics in Joshua 11:2–3 map out a broad territory stretching every direction from Hazor. The intention is clearly not to provide a complete inventory of participants, as was the case for the more limited Jerusalem coalition in the southern region. Rather, the impression builds of a vast territory and an overwhelming

97 "Tel Hazor constitutes the largest mound in Israel" (ibid., 107; cf. 108–109).

<span id="page-428-3"></span>force — precisely the scene conveyed by the narrator in verse 4, in fact. However imposing the southern coalition might have appeared, it is now dwarfed by the force assembled at the instigation of the king of Hazor.

<span id="page-428-4"></span>The definitive modern location of the battle site, the "waters of Merom" (v. 5), has also eluded modern scholars. The account suggests, however, that it is not far north of Hazor, and the course of the Nahal Dishon is one good possibility in which case it would only be just over 2 miles (3.2 km) north-northeast of Hazor.

<span id="page-428-5"></span><span id="page-428-1"></span><span id="page-428-0"></span>11:6–9 As in the case of the battle against the southern coalition (10:8), so here Joshua is given an oracle of divine reassurance. This goes beyond the previous word spoken by the Lord to Joshua in both providing timing ("tomorrow at this time") and conveying military instruction. The destruction of chariots has been previously encountered in the flight from Egypt, as the Egyptian chariots were first immobilized and then destroyed by the Lord (Ex. 14:25; 15:4). Here chariotry adds to the imposing and superior nature of this army, in contrast to the earlier southern campaign. Destroying these weapons of the aggressor and would-be oppressor is, then, not only divinely mandated by historical precedent and this word (cf. Ps. 46:9) but also clearly prudent as well. The hamstringing of the horses may seem to contemporary readers to pose another kind of ethical question. In social and historical context, however, this is not so barbaric as may be imagined. It involves

<span id="page-428-7"></span>a simple incision damaging the horses' single front flexor tendon after the battle. As a result, the horses are not able to lift the front leg so they are no longer appropriate to be put to a chariot and can only be used for more peaceable purposes as agriculture and haulage. So the hamstringing is not some kind of battle tactic, but a way of making the horses useless for future battles.100

<span id="page-428-2"></span>The note that Joshua and his warriors come on their enemies "suddenly" provides another link to the preceding chapter (Josh. 10:9) in this terse battle account. Again Israel pursues an army fleeing before them. The trajectory of flight is remarkable. Rather than fleeing toward their cities to the south and west, the opponents flee to the north. Identification of two of the place names remains uncertain, but together these names appear to sketch the northern boundary of later tribal allotments from the coastal plain north of Acco on the west as far north as Sidon and toward the east in the direction of Mount Hermon.101 And again victory is complete: the vast northern coalition and its territories fall to Israel in one swift action. Israel on her part complies fully with the demands of the Lord.

<span id="page-428-6"></span>11:10–13 Unlike in his account of the southern campaign, which gave a detailed list of sites engaged by Israel, here the narrator is content with a broad summary statement implying the conquest of the whole region and its cities, whether

<span id="page-429-5"></span><span id="page-429-3"></span>fortified or not. This summary shares with the previous account an emphasis on the application of *kherem*, here specified in verses 11–12. As in the case of Ai, this is a qualified *kherem*, with some goods available to Israel as plunder. The distinctive element in this case is the attention given to Hazor. The destruction of Hazor has received attention similar to that of the debates surrounding the archaeology of Jericho in scholarly literature, but for something like the opposite reason. In the case of Jericho, a purported absence of archaeological evidence in combination with the supernatural circumstances recounted in Joshua 6 have fueled the debate. In the case of Hazor, abundant archaeological evidence of destruction by fierce fire in the thirteenth century BC, in combination with a clear statement in Joshua 11:11, 13 that Joshua's forces were responsible for just such a conflagration, has made joining these dots all too easy. Such a connection was forthrightly drawn by Yigael Yadin but has been resisted by those of a more skeptical bent and those who require a higher standard of proof.102 One can say that, at the least, in the Bronze Age incineration of Hazor is a remarkable intersection between biblical memory and contemporary archaeology.

<span id="page-429-6"></span><span id="page-429-4"></span>11:14 As noted above, the application of *kherem* in this campaign allows Israel to take "spoil . . . and the livestock" as plunder. The mention of livestock provides a further contrast to the treatment of the coalition's war horses. The application of the *kherem*, then, is "unambiguous against horses and chariots (representing citystates and dominance), but ambiguous against cattle (who represent an alternative future)."103

<span id="page-429-7"></span><span id="page-429-2"></span><span id="page-429-1"></span><span id="page-429-0"></span>11:15 The narrator's notice in summary of this campaign—that the chain of command has Yahweh as the source and Moses as the first recipient, who transmitted orders to Joshua—is on first sight somewhat jarring at this point. Joshua has been in direct receipt of the Lord's commands and, since the crossing of the Jordan, affirmed as being on the same level as Moses himself (3:7; 4:14). And yet 11:12, with its mention of "Moses the servant of the Lord" (cf. 1:1), has subtly prepared for this perception of Joshua's performance here. The only other moment displaying this kind of command structure is at the crossing of the Jordan in 4:10, where the priests' bearing the ark of the Lord's presence is connected to Moses' "command" to Joshua—the only two places in the Hebrew Bible where this collocation is found. There seems to be, then, a deliberate recognition that, having come to this point, the campaign has reached a threshold. The moment of entry into the Land of Promise finds a counterpart in the final regional campaign, in which the gifted land has been taken by Israel. Work yet remains, but the boundaries of the land have been secured.

<span id="page-429-8"></span>11:16–20 The sense that the narrator is approaching an ending of sorts is signaled in another way in the geographical summary that follows the victory over the northern coalition. This summary describes not only the territories just defeated

The topography described in verse 16 maps out the central, eastern, and western regions, while the two mountain ranges of verse 17 stretch from the southernmost to northernmost points that define the extent of the land. The summary is remarkably inclusive, yet it culminates in a statement of a more political kind, that "all their kings" had been captured and killed. As the book has demonstrated previously, the key antagonism is not between peoples but between the kings of the earth and the King of kings.

<span id="page-430-5"></span><span id="page-430-2"></span>This provides a natural segue from the geographical summary to the theological. The claim of verse 18 that Joshua "made war a long time with all those kings" may come as a surprise, given the way that the accounts of the southern and northern campaigns both assert the suddenness of the Israelite response (10:9; 11:7), while the rapid narration conveys the impression of the swift action of Joshua and the army of Israel. A comment attributed to the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi takes the verse as a rebuke to Joshua for prolonging the subjugation of the land in order to lengthen his own life: once the conquest was completed, his life's purpose would be fulfilled and his days at an end. Modern commentators see this verse rather as attesting to the compressed narration of this phase of conquest, from which many details have been omitted.

Yet the "theology of history" contained in these verses is "especially arresting."104 Enemy intransigence is turned to the purpose of fulfilling a divine plan carried out through Israelite obedience. We find a resonance here with the purpose of God fulfilled in the choices of the king of Egypt in Exodus; here the kings of Canaan likewise choose to oppose Israel's God. "Thus the gracious action of Yahweh, hidden behind human choices, and the fidelity of Israel worked together to bring the divine will to fruition."105 In this case the initiative of the Gibeonites, here identified as Hivites, proves an exception, and this recognition appears again to imply that it was possible to make peace with Israel and her God. A note of grace is also strongly implied, as these verses also suggest that the hearts of the Gibeonites were not "hardened."

<span id="page-430-7"></span><span id="page-430-6"></span><span id="page-430-1"></span>11:21–22 It seems like it is all over—only for another enemy to appear. The synchronism "at that time" remains vague; it seems the narrator is preserving this brief report of the destruction of the mysterious Anakim by placing it here. Once again the term *kherem* is used, the last time it will be applied in the book. (The one further usage, 22:20, is a reference to the account of Achan.) These descendants of Anak (Deut. 1:28), dispersed throughout the land, were the "giants" (Num. 13:33 KJV) who so filled with fear ten of the Israelite spies that the exodus generation as a whole was prevented from proceeding into the land (Num. 13:28–33). This decisive moment lived on in memory, as Moses reminded the conquest generation of the intimidating presence of the Anakim and of the reality that "he who goes

<span id="page-431-0"></span>over before you as a consuming fire is the Lord your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you" (Deut. 9:1–3). The Anakim are, then, both the first and the last enemy in the land. Another link is thus forged between the wilderness and conquest experiences, the parents' failure to confront this enemy now being rectified under Joshua.

<span id="page-431-10"></span>11:23 Only now can the "whole land" be said to have been taken, so that the "land had rest from war." This will prove to be only a pause, however, and the phrase will be heard again in the book in different forms (but in exactly this form once more; 14:15)106 before the conquest and settlement is finally complete.

The success of Israel against the southern cities might well seem to be a notable achievement and an opportunity for rest. It is not to be so. For all its resonances with the southern campaign, the northern campaign represents an appreciable crescendo of force marshaled against Israel. The foe is greater, their weapons stronger. If confusion, hail, and a prolonged day helped Israel's engagement of the Jerusalem coalition, against the much more impressive Hazor coalition there is only the renewed word of the Lord to Joshua not to be afraid (11:6)—although by now the Lord's word is more than enough. It is not an inevitable pattern, but it is familiar enough in Scripture and in life: winning one victory leads not to the end of struggle but to another battle with a stronger enemy.

<span id="page-431-9"></span><span id="page-431-8"></span><span id="page-431-6"></span><span id="page-431-5"></span><span id="page-431-4"></span>With the victory over the royal cities of the northern coalition (vv. 11, 12; 21 [summary]) and the ancient Anakim (v. 22), *kherem* ends, at least as a feature of the Israelite settlement of the land in Joshua. As noted above, its future application will be rare and exceptional, as too its application here should be. It is notable that, as this phase of Israel's warfare draws to a close, explicit connection is made back to the Lord's command through Moses. For Israel this has been a matter of obedience to the divine command, limited for the most part to those royal powers that gathered military force against them; the kings of Canaan sought to annihilate Israel but were themselves "devoted to destruction" (11:20). Perhaps there is yet another way of understanding the conjunction between verse 18, which speaks of how "Joshua made war a long time with all those kings," and verse 19, which points out that only the Hivite inhabitants of Gibeon "made peace with the people of Israel." Just as there was space in Achan's story for repentance and turning to God, so here we can see implied the possibility for the kings of Canaan to have come to a different conclusion and to have understood, as Rahab did, that everything they knew of Israel's God meant that he alone had the right and the power to dispose of the land as he would and that any future lay not in opposing but in worshiping him. But it was not to be.

<span id="page-431-7"></span><span id="page-431-3"></span><span id="page-431-2"></span><span id="page-431-1"></span><sup>106</sup> The combination of a form of the Hebrew *shaqat* ("to be quiet, at peace") with "the land" is the formula that marks the pauses from crisis in the book of Judges (3:11, 30; 5:31; 8:28; 18:7). It differs from the notices about "rest" (a form of *nuakh*) that are the typical notices of cessation from war, punctuating Joshua (1:13, 15; 3:13; 4:3, 8; 6:23; 21:44; 22:4; 23:1).

<span id="page-432-7"></span><span id="page-432-6"></span><span id="page-432-5"></span><span id="page-432-4"></span><span id="page-432-3"></span><span id="page-432-1"></span><span id="page-432-0"></span>The closing observation, that the "land had rest from war" (v. 23), provides not only a glimpse of peace but a sign of hope. The Hebrew verb used here, a form of *shaqat*, has more to do with quiet repose and peace than does another Hebrew verb typically translated as "rest," (*nuakh*) which typically refers instead to that time of relaxation after work (1:13, 15; 22:4 [in connection with the Transjordan tribes]). This rest, even if temporary, is nonetheless real. The reflection of the psalmist on God's establishment of his reign in Judah clearly signals victory over Egypt in Psalm 76:6, but the observation that the "earth feared and was still" (Ps. 76:8) echoes this language from Joshua. The psalmist's association of the coming of the just rule of God with the rejoicing of the "humble" (Ps. 76:9)—that is, the afflicted poor—at God's cutting off the "kings of the earth" (Ps. 76:12) joins with Psalm 2 in giving another perspective on the defeat of the hostile kings of Canaan. Although Joshua does not feature as prominently in the book of Hebrews as does either Moses or Aaron, he is included there as one who provided a kind of rest, even if it was to prove in some sense incomplete, even inadequate (Heb. 4:8). But this is an eschatological note, pointing to a future, fuller, final rest for the people of God.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-433-2"></span><span id="page-433-0"></span>Having connected the obedience of Israel under Joshua to the commands of the Lord through Moses up to the defeat of the northern coalition, and with the extent of the land now subdued, the narrator pauses to provide a summary of all the kings conquered by Israel both east and west of the Jordan under both Moses and Joshua. The two Amorite kings defeated by Moses have taken on almost a symbolic quality of the power of God to subdue kings opposed to him. These battles were narrated in the book of Numbers; here the narrator provides some details about them, along with their geographical territories (12:1–6). These lands are to be settled by the so-called Transjordan tribes (cf. 1:12–18), which form an early part of the land settlement passages in 13:8–32. The rest of the chapter provides an extended inventory of the thirty-one kings defeated by Joshua (12:7–24). Most of these names are familiar from the immediately preceding narratives, although some have not previously been mentioned. The chapter as a whole signals that a turning point has been reached in the progress of God's people into the Promised Land.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-433-1"></span>12:1 The narrator first provides a general statement of the extent of the land east of the Jordan conquered by "the people of Israel," from the Arnon River as the southern boundary to Mount Hermon marking the extent to the north. This area describes a sizeable region east of the Jordan, from the southern limit at the midway point of the ancient extent of the Dead Sea to the Hermon range over 140 miles (230 km) to the north. The verses that follow summarize the histories of <span id="page-434-3"></span><span id="page-434-2"></span><span id="page-434-0"></span>Sihon and Og previously recounted in Numbers 21:21–35 and recalled by Moses in Deuteronomy 2:26–3:11, going on to the land allotment to the Transjordan tribes in Deuteronomy 3:12–17. At this point in the Joshua account, however, Moses' name is not mentioned.

<span id="page-434-18"></span><span id="page-434-8"></span><span id="page-434-1"></span>12:2–3 The territories of "Sihon king of the Amorites" now follow, with more detail than that given in the brief statement of Numbers 21:24; this finds a counterpart in Joshua 13:9–11. The north-south extent is roughly halved, with the Jabbok dissecting this axis. The east-west dimension is given in terms that range about 50 miles (80 km) from the Jordan eastward at its largest extent.

<span id="page-434-10"></span><span id="page-434-9"></span>12:4–5 As ever with this set pair, attention now shifts to "Og king of Bashan," farther to the north. Although in the Numbers account less attention is given to Og than to Sihon, here the one tidbit of narrative detail ("one of the remnant of the Rephaim"; Josh. 12:4) attaches to Og. The regional extent is even larger; the northern edge has already identified been with Hermon, but the east-west trajectory includes a vast swathe incorporating Damascus, with the eastern extent coinciding with Salecah (v. 5), roughly 67 miles (108 km) east of the Jordan valley.

<span id="page-434-11"></span>The Geshurites and Maacathites (v. 5) are both minor Aramaean kingdoms, with Geshur to the south and Maacah to its north, with an eastern border on the Jordan River, level with the Sea of Galilee and stretching north toward Bashan. They will be noticed again in 13:11, 13.

<span id="page-434-19"></span><span id="page-434-12"></span><span id="page-434-4"></span>12:6 With the neighboring territories of the two kings having been mapped, Moses is now twice named, both times qualified as "the servant of the Lord," as in 1:1 (cf. comment there). The two mentions coincide with the two phases of activity, first the vanquishing of the enemy and then the assignment of their territories to the Transjordan tribes. Notably, these come in quick succession, as coincident as they can be (cf. Deut. 3:12–17).

<span id="page-434-13"></span><span id="page-434-6"></span>12:7–8 Attention now turns to the conquests to the west of the Jordan accomplished under "Joshua and the people of Israel." The broad extent of the land is already familiar from the summary found in Joshua 11, but here is appended also the names of the nations associated with these territories. In this case six nations are listed, omitting the Girgashites from the slightly longer list given at 3:10 (cf. comment on 3:9–13). This, one might say, is territory but not kings.

<span id="page-434-20"></span><span id="page-434-17"></span><span id="page-434-16"></span><span id="page-434-15"></span><span id="page-434-5"></span>12:9–24 By contrast, the list that now follows is interested in kings but not territories. Several of the cities enumerated are either unidentified in historical geography (e.g., Hormah, v. 14; Adullam, v. 15) or unknown outside this list (e.g., Geder, v. 13; Lasharon, v. 18; Goiim, v. 23).107 Even so, the order and import of the list is readily apparent. The sequence of names roughly follows that of the conquest accounts of the preceding chapters, beginning with Joshua and Ai (v. 9) and the kings of

<span id="page-434-14"></span><span id="page-434-7"></span><sup>107</sup> For a convenient attempt to provide identifications cf. Hess, *Joshua*, 244–253. For more detail and discussion of toponyms in chapter 12 cf. Van Bekkum, *From Conquest to Coexistence*, 196–213.

<span id="page-435-6"></span><span id="page-435-5"></span><span id="page-435-4"></span>the southern coalition forged by the king of Jerusalem (vv. 10–16a) before adding an insert that lists cities not otherwise previously mentioned but located in the central region (vv. 16b–18). Then it moves on to the northern region and the coalition formed by the king of Hazor (vv. 19–24a). As has been seen repeatedly before, however, emphasis falls on the kings defeated, not the number of cities or even the regions gained. This relates at least in part to the theological stance that has been consistently displayed: the conflict is between the kings of earth and the King of heaven and earth. There may be another element in play here, however (cf. Response section).

#### *Response*

<span id="page-435-2"></span><span id="page-435-1"></span>A turning point has been reached. The kings of the land have been defeated. Israel under two successive leaders has done so (vv. 1, 7). The theological summary has already been provided at the end of chapter 11, and further occasions in the chapters to come will provide a moment of pause and further attention to the fidelity and provision of God for his people. The perspective taken here, then, is more anthropological than theological, as Israel's part in this remarkable achievement is briefly but patiently stated.

<span id="page-435-7"></span><span id="page-435-3"></span><span id="page-435-0"></span>The two unequal sections of the chapter keep in the reader's eye the geographical division of the tribes of Israel, already stated plainly at 1:12–15. The allotment of the Transjordan tribes is again made explicit (12:6), even while the tribal allotments of the remaining tribes lay in the future. In a subtle way, this reminder keeps this circumstance before readers. Transjordanian interests also occupy the beginning of the next phase of the book, consuming almost the whole of chapter 13. Ultimately, concern for unity of Transjordan tribes with the rest of the people is seen in the dramatic account of chapter 22. Despite the commitments repeatedly given, a risk is evident in the Transjordanian arrangement. At this moment, however, the summary simply correlates the conquests and allotments east of the Jordan with the success in defeating the kings to the west of the river. Potential fissure is not an overt concern of the narrator.

<span id="page-435-8"></span>Finally, another small imbalance can be detected. Under Moses, defeat of kings and allotment of land were more or less contiguous: the latter followed hard on the heels of the former. In this sense, Moses—pointedly and repeatedly called "the servant of the Lord"—establishes an ideal pattern to which, it seems, Joshua does not quite adhere. The land has been taken; kings have been defeated. But the land remains undistributed and unsettled.

### <span id="page-436-4"></span><span id="page-436-2"></span><span id="page-436-1"></span><span id="page-436-0"></span>The first phase of the book, narrated in chapters 1–12, displays a clear progression. Progress naturally continues in the second part of the book, but the nature of the activity is now distributed throughout Israel rather than being enacted by the people of Israel as a whole, as has been the case up to this point. This more fragmented activity allows also for a different kind of arrangement of the material. The chunks constituting the settlement account can be readily seen: chapter 13 provides a reprise of the Transjordanian settlement; chapters 14–17 describe the settlement of Judah, Ephraim, and the remaining half-tribe of Manasseh (the latter two being the "Joseph" tribes; cf. 16:1, 4) arranged from Gilgal, the original Israelite camp west of the Jordan; chapters 18–19 account for the remainder of the tribal settlements managed from Shiloh; while chapters 20–21 complete the distribution with the civic allotments for refuge (ch. 20) and the tribe of Levi (ch. 21), which does not receive a landed inheritance. It is also possible to discern a deliberate pattern

- (A) Divine Command Repeated (13:1–7)
	- (B) Those with a Place (Transjordan) (13:8–33)

<span id="page-436-7"></span><span id="page-436-6"></span><span id="page-436-5"></span>emerging by arranging these components in this way:108

- (C) *Transition*: Tribal Arrangements Reiterated (14:1–5); Caleb's Inheritance (14:6–15)
	- (D) Judah and "Joseph" (15:1–17:18)
		- (E) The Allocation at Shiloh (18:1–10)
	- (D') The Remaining Seven Tribes (18:11–19:48)
- (C') Joshua's Inheritance (19:49–50);
	- (E') *Summary*: Shiloh Allotments Completed (19:51)
- (B') Those without a Place (cis-Jordan) (20:1–21:42)
- (A') Divine Promises Enacted (21:43–45)

<span id="page-436-3"></span>The outer frame (A/A') contrasts Israel's partial undertaking of God's command, supported by a reassurance that "I myself will drive them out" (13:6), with the completion of God's promises and the end of Israelite settlement. Two unusual settlement patterns are brought together in B/B': the review of the regions already allotted by Moses beyond the Jordan to the two and a half tribes and the

<sup>108</sup> Cf. Hendrik Koorevaar, *De opbouw van het boek Jozua* (Heverlee: Centrum voor Bijbelse Vorming België, 1990), English summary, 281–294; Pitkänen, *Joshua*, 247–250.

<span id="page-437-6"></span><span id="page-437-1"></span><span id="page-437-0"></span>distribution of cities on the west of the Jordan (with three "cities of refuge" also in the Transjordan; 20:8) for those who do not receive an allotment (principally Levi). C/C' frames the rest of the tribal inheritance with the allotment of the two faithful spies of Numbers 13, the only members of the wilderness generation to settle in the Promised Land (cf. Num. 14:30). These sections also represent the future southern kingdom (Caleb from Judah) and northern kingdom (Joshua from Ephraim). D (again combining future north/south) and D' contain the main business, the accounts of the settlements of the "nine and one-half tribes" (Josh. 14:2; cf. 13:7). This leaves E, the Shiloh assembly, as the central point of the extended chiastic structure.

<span id="page-437-5"></span><span id="page-437-4"></span>The result is a careful structuring of the distribution of the land. This is not simply a compendium of place names, sorting out districts under tribal claims. It is shaped around God's purpose for and fidelity in his people's taking of the Land of Promise and his inclusive care for the nation as a whole, marked by a movement toward the center of the land to a place that would be known as an early focal point for the worship life of God's people.

### <span id="page-437-2"></span>JOSHUA 13:1–7

13 Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and the Lord said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to possess. **2**This is the land that yet remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all those of the Geshurites **<sup>3</sup>** (from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron, it is counted as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron), and those of the Avvim, **<sup>4</sup>** in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites, **<sup>5</sup>** and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath, **<sup>6</sup>** all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel. Only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you. **7**Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-437-3"></span>As the second major section of the book begins, again God speaks directly to Joshua, providing instructions for the new context in which Joshua finds himself. After the brief statement from the narrator in verse 1a, God's speech continues through to the end of verse 7. The speech first affirms what the narrator has just

<span id="page-438-8"></span><span id="page-438-6"></span>stated, and then verses 2–6a survey the "land that yet remains" (v. 2). Verse 6b interjects another note of divine promise and repeats the command, with verse 7 bringing this to focus on the tribes yet to settle.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-438-5"></span><span id="page-438-4"></span><span id="page-438-1"></span>13:1 Narrative content and structural features (cf. Overview of 13:1–21:45) signal that this moment brings a new phase of life for Joshua and the people of Israel. There is a further indicator in the very structure of this verse. The condition of Israel's leader is reported, and then the Lord confirms the same information in the same words. This same pattern begins the book as a whole in 1:1–2, reporting Moses' death, after which the Lord directs Joshua to lead Israel across the Jordan.109 Here the instruction is to continue that advance into the land. Is there some implication that things have stalled? This may be an implication of the "old and advanced in years" description, found again in 23:1 and affirmed by Joshua in direct speech in 23:2. This phrase is used two other times in the OT: Abraham is "old, well advanced in years" when he seeks a wife for Isaac, the child of promise (Gen. 24:1), and David likewise is "old and advanced in years" when Abishag is found as his "nurse" and he has as yet failed to arrange for succession to the throne of Israel (1 Kings 1:1). Like Abraham before him and David in time to come, it seems Joshua has delayed this arrangement longer than he ought to have done.

<span id="page-438-11"></span><span id="page-438-10"></span><span id="page-438-9"></span><span id="page-438-2"></span><span id="page-438-0"></span>This verse begins the second-longest divine speech in the book, and the second-to-last. With the bulk of its content devoted to a litany of place names, it may seem an unusual word for Joshua to receive. Yet this speech contains most of the essential elements found in its counterpart, Joshua 1:2–9. It includes the affirmation of the new situation, a geographical notice concerning the gifted land, a promise of divine assistance, and a clear word of instruction or command. The obvious missing component in this last speech is the emphatic encouragement to bold, confident action; also absent here is the attention to the "Book of the Law" (1:7–8). Clearly, some lessons have been learned during the series of campaigns that have won victories over the hostile kings of the Canaanites. The overriding concern, however, is with what has *not* been done.

<span id="page-438-7"></span><span id="page-438-3"></span>13:2–6a The "land that yet remains" stretches from the border with Egypt in the south as far as the regions around Damascus in the northwest. The focus falls on the Philistine coastal plain and its associated cities. The trajectory runs northward up the Mediterranean coast toward the region of Tyre and Sidon, then moves eastward across the northern border with the Amorites, finishing in the hilly region associated today with the Golan Heights. Some of the toponyms used (e.g., Mearah) remain unidentified.

The Lord speaks of "land," and the speech includes a good number of place names. But there is a corresponding association with people — Philistines, Geshurites, Gebalites, "inhabitants of the hill country," Sidonians. The landscape of the Promised Land is populated, but Israel must now come into its inheritance.

<span id="page-439-4"></span><span id="page-439-1"></span><span id="page-439-0"></span>13:6b–7 "Inheritance" (Hb. *nahalah*), used twice in short compass, comes into prominence here, having been used only once previously in the book (11:23). In the settlement chapters (chs. 13–21) it is used forty-five times, and only a further four times in the book's closing chapters, three of those coming in the book's final six verses. Clearly, then, the term looms large as a conceptual marker for Israel's settlement of the land. For English speakers it summons to mind the idea of coming into possession of something at the death of its owner. However, in the context of Joshua the term refers to property, or an estate, over which one exercises rights, these rights being expected to be maintained within a family/clan across generations. Entitlement, then, is the fundamental concept, with the passing along through generations being secondary.110 As Ellen Davis notes,

<span id="page-439-5"></span>Because the complex of ideas represented by the single term *naḥălâ* focuses on land possession, elements of that complex enter into discussions about political sovereignty in a national sense. However, I am highlighting its neglected aspect, for the biblical development of the concept points not only, and maybe not primarily, to possession "from above," based on conquest, but also to possession "from below," based on care.111

Joined to the notion of *nahalah* is the related term *halaq*, used as a verb in verse 7 ("divide") but often as a noun, *heleq*, with the sense of "portion" or "share."112 Although *heleq* and *nahalah* appear to be nearly synonymous, *heleq* conveys a distributive sense not inherent in *nahalah*.

<span id="page-439-3"></span>Not to be missed as these new concepts (in Joshua) are introduced is the brief but significant word of reassurance the Lord gives to Joshua, that "I myself will drive them out" (v. 6). However, this does not absolve Israel of the responsibility of acting on this divine imperative—quite the opposite. It is the basis on which they obey.

#### *Response*

The impulse to spiritualize a passage such as this one is difficult to resist. It should never be forgotten that in this speech God depicts for Joshua a real landscape with

<sup>110</sup> Cf. Norman Habel, *The Land is Mine: Six Biblical Land Ideologies* (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995), 33–35. Habel glosses the Hebrew *nahalah* as "allotment, the holding to which [tribe and ancestral family are] entitled by virtue of the divinely approved land grant process" (34), referencing Joshua 14:2–5.

real inhabitants. The chapters that follow likewise relentlessly root the life of the people of Israel in the land given to them by the Lord. At the same time, the dynamic that sparks this last direct word of God to Joshua is a familiar one in both the OT and NT. Beginnings may be made, but persistence to the finish is required. Commenting on this dynamic in Joshua, Alice Hodgkin observes,

Though "all things are ours" in Christ, it remains for us to take possession of them experimentally by faith. The promise was that every place that the sole of their foot should tread should be theirs. And in the thirteenth chapter of this book the Lord said unto Joshua, "There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed." There was a slackness on the part of Israel to possess the land which the Lord had given them (xviii. 3).113

Some responsibility for that slackness appears to be attributed to Joshua. The repeated contrast of the alacrity with which Moses allotted the "inheritance" of the Transjordan tribes with the more leisurely pace under Joshua subsequent to the conquest of kings reinforces this perception.

<span id="page-440-7"></span><span id="page-440-6"></span>The claim God makes of Joshua, and through him of Israel as well, is not only for perseverance (cf. Heb. 10:32–39; 12:12) but for an unceasing endurance. There is a sense here in which vigilance and perseverance are two sides of the same coin: flagging on one side will lead to failure on the other. We can understand the calls in Revelation for the "endurance of the saints" (Rev. 14:12; cf. 13:10) to have the same sense. Meanwhile, if the theme of persistence, endurance, and perseverance with attendant obedience remains somewhat implicit here, by the time of Joshua's final speech in chapter 24 it will have grown to startling proportions.

<span id="page-440-3"></span><span id="page-440-1"></span><span id="page-440-0"></span>The language of the Hebrew *nahalah*, which brings with it some sense of "entitlement," may sit uneasily, especially with the recognition of the populated landscape to which attention has already been drawn. The underlying principle in terms of the rebellion of the "kings of the earth" (Ps. 76:12), discussed in relation to the southern and northern campaigns, may feel too distant to be helpful here. But the notion that all creation is in the gift of the Creator is also a pervasive biblical principle. It was the basis on which Israel's land regulations were framed: "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine" (Lev. 25:23). The psalmists assert and sing of God's claim and ownership of all there is: "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein" (Ps. 24:1) and, again, "The world and its fullness are mine" (Ps. 50:12). Politically, this extended also to people groups not typically associated with divine action on their behalf, expressed poignantly in Amos 9:7. This will in fullness of time be realized in a gathering together of a people of God from "every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages" (Rev. 7:9; cf. Eph. 2:13–18). In this case, then, God exercises the right to gift the land to his people; they in turn should show it the care its Creator intended.

**<sup>8</sup>**With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh*<sup>1</sup>* the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them: **<sup>9</sup>** from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon; **<sup>10</sup>** and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites; **<sup>11</sup>** and Gilead, and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah; **<sup>12</sup>** all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); these Moses had struck and driven out. **13**Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.

**<sup>14</sup>**To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance. The offerings by fire to the Lord God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to him.

**<sup>15</sup>**And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben according to their clans. **<sup>16</sup>** So their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba; **17**with Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the tableland; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baalmeon, **<sup>18</sup>** and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, **<sup>19</sup>** and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, **<sup>20</sup>** and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth, **<sup>21</sup>** that is, all the cities of the tableland, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. **22**Balaam also, the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, was killed with the sword by the people of Israel among the rest of their slain. **23**And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary. This was the inheritance of the people of Reuben, according to their clans with their cities and villages.

**<sup>24</sup>**Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of Gad, to the people of Gad, according to their clans. **25**Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, to Aroer, which is east of Rabbah, **<sup>26</sup>** and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir,*<sup>2</sup>* **<sup>27</sup>** and in the valley Beth-haram, Bethnimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, having the Jordan as a boundary, to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth, eastward beyond the Jordan. **28**This is the inheritance of the people of Gad according to their clans, with their cities and villages.

**<sup>29</sup>**And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was allotted to the half-tribe of the people of Manasseh according to their clans. **30**Their region extended from Mahanaim, through all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities, **<sup>31</sup>** and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. These were allotted to the people of Machir the son of Manasseh for the half of the people of Machir according to their clans.

<span id="page-442-11"></span><span id="page-442-10"></span>**<sup>32</sup>**These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho. **33**But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the Lord God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he said to them.

<span id="page-442-8"></span><span id="page-442-7"></span><span id="page-442-5"></span><span id="page-442-4"></span>Before the text goes on to relate the distribution of the "land that yet remains" (Josh. 13:2) to the "nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh" (13:7; cf. 14:2), it first rehearses once again the apportioning of the land to the east of the Jordan under Moses. The passage divides neatly: a frame—which combines a regional overview (13:8–13, 32) with a notice about the non-inheritance of Levi (vv. 14, 33)—contains three paragraphs attending to each of the Transjordanian tribal settlements: Reuben, firstborn and first settled, in verses 15–23; Gad's allotment in verses 24–28; and the half-tribe of Manasseh in verses 29–31. Each of these paragraphs begins with a notice of what lands and holdings "Moses gave" to them and concludes with a brief summation. Within this regularity we find interesting variations.

- II.B. Settlement under Moses: A Retrospective (13:8–33)
	- 1. Regional Overview of the Transjordanian Settlement, Excluding Levi (13:8–14)
	- 2. Moses Assigns Reuben's Settlement (13:15–23)
	- 3. Moses Assigns Gad's Settlement (13:24–28)
	- 4. Moses Assigns the Half-Tribe of Manasseh's Settlement (13:29–31)
	- 5. Summary of the Transjordanian Settlement, Excluding Levi (13:32–33)

<span id="page-442-0"></span>This is the fourth time the Transjordanian settlement has been reported subsequent to the original account of the defeat of the kings Sihon and Og in Numbers 21 (but cf. Num. 21:25, 35). The four accounts are the following:

- <span id="page-442-1"></span>(1) Moses' distribution after arranging for the Transjordan tribes' continued participation in the conquest of the Promised Land (Num. 32:33–42).
- <span id="page-442-2"></span>(2) Moses' rehearsal of the distribution in the sermon on the plains of Moab (Deut. 3:12–17).
- <span id="page-442-3"></span>(3) The regional summary concluding the first part of Joshua (Josh. 12:1–6).
- <span id="page-442-6"></span>(4) The preface to the settlement of the nine and a half tribes (Josh. 13:8–33).

On each occasion some association is made with the history of the defeat of the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, who take a special place as providing a precedent and template for further royal battles. The level of detail reported from those battles varies markedly, as do the nature and the extent of the geographical particulars provided. The distribution itself appears in summary form in the second and third accounts; more details, especially concerning the naming of cities affected within region, are provided in the first and fourth. No two are the same; each contributes in a way that meets the need of the immediate context. Here the effect of including this preface, which clearly marks an interruption in the main business of getting on to the settlement of the remaining tribes, is to set up a template for Joshua to follow: he must now do as Moses had previously done. It also provides something of a literary template for the reports that follow in chapters 14–19.

#### <span id="page-443-8"></span>*Comment*

<span id="page-443-6"></span><span id="page-443-4"></span><span id="page-443-3"></span><span id="page-443-2"></span>13:8–13 The introduction to the regions settled by the two and a half Transjordan tribes echoes the one just provided at the beginning of chapter 12; they are "near neighbors" in more than one sense. Close in proximity, these introductions are also close in strategy, providing a south-to-north résumé of the settlement east of the Jordan. Sihon and Og once again are named, with Og's status as last of the Rephaim recalled once more (cf. Deut. 3:11; Josh. 12:4). The territories of the Geshurites and Maacathites were mentioned in the previous summary (12:5), but here in addition their persistent presence among the people of Israel is registered (13:3). At a number of points in the unfolding account of Israelite settlement such persistent inhabitants will be noted. They undermine superficial comparisons of Joshua and Judges that assert a total conquest in Joshua and a partial one in Judges, sometimes also set up as a contradiction between the books. Such contrasts are overdrawn.

<span id="page-443-11"></span><span id="page-443-5"></span><span id="page-443-0"></span>13:14, 33 Included in the frame of the settlement under Moses is the repeated observation that Moses provided no "inheritance" for the tribe of Levi. This, too, is a matter of obedience and right order in the constitution of God's people in the Promised Land. The arrangement is first put in place in Numbers 18:21–24, in which the tithe is recorded as priestly compensation for non-inheritance. The arrangement has an element of reciprocity: for giving the tithe, the rest of Israel receives protection from the destructive outcome of their desecrating the holy things associated with sacrifice and offerings. Along with the tithe, Numbers 35:1–8 stipulates that an allocation of cities and pasturelands should be drawn from the tribal settlements to provide for the Levites' dwelling, in conjunction with the cities of refuge. This takes place in Joshua 20–21 (cf. comments there). The non-inheritance of Levi appears again as the remainder of the settlement proceeds (14:3, 4) and yet again as the second phase of distribution is initiated (18:7).

<span id="page-443-10"></span><span id="page-443-9"></span><span id="page-443-7"></span><span id="page-443-1"></span>The two notices here in 13:14, 33 each offers a slightly different rationale for this circumstance: the tribe of Levi receives as its "inheritance" either the "offerings" (v. 14) or the "the Lord God of Israel" himself (v. 33). These two statements <span id="page-444-1"></span>reflect the regulations of the priesthood in Deuteronomy 18:1–2. The priesthood may be landless, but it is privileged nonetheless.

<span id="page-444-6"></span><span id="page-444-3"></span>13:15–23 Reuben's territory is the southernmost of the three Transjordanian allotments, and its description follows the general south-to-north trajectory of the regional summary. The distinctive feature in this account is the two embedded narrative references. Although Sihon and Og both appear again in the Gad and eastern Manasseh settlements below, in neither of those cases (Josh. 13:27, 30) is there any narrative element attached; this mention of the nature of Moses' victory over Sihon serves as reminder enough (v. 21). The execution of the other leaders of Sihon mentioned in verse 21 triggers the memory of the danger posed by the false prophet Balaam, these deaths being recorded in Numbers 31:8 during the war against Midian. The brief narrative allusions signal both triumph and danger in the earlier history of Israel.

<span id="page-444-5"></span><span id="page-444-4"></span><span id="page-444-0"></span>13:24–28 The settlement of Gad lies to the north of Reuben. It includes the remainder of Sihon's territory (Josh. 13:27) not taken by Reuben, and it extends as far north as the Sea of Galilee ("Chinnereth"; v. 27). The Jordan River lies as boundary to the east.

<span id="page-444-7"></span>13:29–32 With the region associated with Sihon disposed of, the half-tribe of Manasseh occupies the territory formerly associated with Og. This extends yet farther north toward Bashan. Here a total of the allocated cities is also included. This feature will appear again in the reports of the further tribal settlements under Joshua.

<span id="page-444-9"></span><span id="page-444-8"></span>This version of Transjordanian settlement marks the last time in the exodus and conquest accounts that the pairing of Sihon and Og is seen. The two have a prominent role as paradigmatic conquests, and this includes the settlement of the Transjordan tribes in these territories. They appear again in later parts of the OT only at 1 Kings 4:19, in the overview of Solomon's administrative arrangements, and beyond that as historical reminiscences in the prayers of Nehemiah 9:22 and Psalms 135:11; 136:19–20. It may be claiming too much to see these as firstfruits of Israel's beginning to receive the Promised Land. There is no doubt, however, that the early steps in fidelity and tenacity to God's commands in light of God's promise were taken in the victories over Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-444-2"></span>It is difficult to know why the narrator chooses to rehearse once more the settlement east of the Jordan that took place under Moses, interrupting as it does the initiation of the settlement under Joshua (cf. Josh. 13:7; 14:2). If authorial purpose is difficult to ascertain, some effects on the reader can still be noted. First, providing this review integrates the Transjordanian settlement into that of the rest of the people under Joshua. As discussed above, the final notice of Sihon and Og also suggests the importance of integrating the settlement of their territories into the full account of Israel's settlement as a whole. Weaving in this account at this point reinforces the perception of a single settlement by the whole people of Israel.

<span id="page-445-1"></span><span id="page-445-0"></span>The second point that emerges is the counterpoint to this assertion of unity. Some sense of anxiety over the unity of God's people also seems to be harbored. The flashback to the death of Balaam signals this most poignantly. Yet in all the accounts of the arrangements with the two and a half tribes something of this undercurrent is lurking. Thus in Numbers 32:1–32 Moses labors over eliciting commitment from these tribes to accompany their brothers into the land across the Jordan. So too the book of Joshua itself begins with these tribes' declaring their obedience and parroting God's encouragement to Joshua (Josh. 1:12–18). There is an element of foreshadowing here, as assertions of unity betray a fear of fragmentation, a fear realized in chapter 22.

### <span id="page-445-3"></span><span id="page-445-2"></span>JOSHUA 14:1–15

14 These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit. **2**Their inheritance was by lot, just as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes. **3**For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. **4**For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance. **<sup>5</sup>**The people of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses; they allotted the land.

**<sup>6</sup>**Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the Lord said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. **<sup>7</sup>** I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. **8**But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the Lord my God. **9**And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God.' **10**And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the Lord spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. **<sup>11</sup>** I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming. **<sup>12</sup>** So now

as the Lord said."

**<sup>13</sup>**Then Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. **14**Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the Lord, the God of Israel. **15**Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba.*<sup>1</sup>* (Arba*<sup>2</sup>* was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-446-8"></span><span id="page-446-1"></span><span id="page-446-0"></span>With the review of the Transjordanian allotment complete, the stage is now set for the work identified in God's final word to Joshua (13:1). As noted in the Overview of 13:1–21:45, multiple endpoints are in view for the work that remains. All will be done finally only when the Levites have their dwellings allocated as well; this takes place in chapter 21, preceded by the provision of cities of refuge in chapter 20. The main concern here, however, is with the remaining "nine and one-half tribes" (14:2), and this activity will only be completed in chapter 19.

<span id="page-446-7"></span><span id="page-446-6"></span><span id="page-446-4"></span><span id="page-446-3"></span><span id="page-446-2"></span>The narrator provides a pronounced and explicit transition from lands east of the Jordan to the western settlement in 14:1–5. This provides a rationale for what is about to take place and offers an accounting for the tribal groupings in place as the allocation of land unfolds. Judah is the first of the cis-Jordan tribes to find a home, and its story begins with a personal focus on the settlement of Caleb (14:6–14). Caleb's story has a counterpart in the settlement of Joshua (19:49–50), which is much more briefly reported than Caleb's is here. There is clearly something distinctive about this personal story. Even the narrator's final, brief observations (14:15) lend a sense of closure to the Caleb account that seems surprising if it serves simply as the first of the tribal settlements of Judah.

<span id="page-446-5"></span>At a superficial level, then, this passage sets in motion the long-awaited process of allotting territories in the Promised Land for the remaining tribes. Lurking just below the surface, however, are issues of obedience and identity.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-447-10"></span><span id="page-447-9"></span><span id="page-447-7"></span><span id="page-447-0"></span>14:1–5 Although the divine alert came to Joshua (13:1–7) and is here put into motion under the leadership of Joshua and Eleazar, its execution is framed as Israel's obedience (14:1, 5). Before proceeding with the division of the land itself, the narrator sets out with some care the circumstances under which that division takes place. Verse 2 stipulates that, in accord with the divine command to Moses, the "inheritance" of the "nine and one-half tribes" is to be decided "by lot." This notice accomplishes two purposes: it both declares that the remaining land allotment takes place "by lot" and also by implication explains why the previous settlement of the two and one-half tribes did not. Yahweh's initial instruction to Moses concerning division by lot is found in Numbers 26:52–56, where it comes at the conclusion of the census of the twelve tribes of the conquest generation (including Ephraim and Manasseh) but precedes the census account of the tribe of Levi, which was excluded from the settlement. At this point it would appear to apply to all the tribes, but in Numbers 33:54, after the land is allotted to the Transjordan tribes under Moses and Eleazar, the Lord renews the command to Moses that the remaining tribes should inherit "by lot." On one further occasion Moses himself reports the divine stipulation, as an element of the survey of geographical limits of the Promised Land to the west of the Jordan, again after the Transjordanian allotment has taken place (Num. 34:13–15). The *requirement* to make use of the "lot" moving forward is stated in Joshua 14:2, while the *absence* of the use of lots is thus explained in 14:3. This will be an integral part of the obedience registered in verse 5. Mention of the "lot" (Hb. *goral*) is unevenly distributed through the book, with all twenty-six of the occurrences in the book found in chapters 14–21 (which account for one-third of all such occurrences in the Hebrew Bible as a whole), including twenty in Joshua 18–19; 21 alone.

<span id="page-447-16"></span><span id="page-447-12"></span><span id="page-447-11"></span><span id="page-447-8"></span><span id="page-447-6"></span><span id="page-447-5"></span><span id="page-447-4"></span><span id="page-447-3"></span><span id="page-447-2"></span><span id="page-447-1"></span>Again the non-inheritance of Levi receives prominent notice (cf. comment on 13:14, 33). The positive command to settle by lot in Numbers 26:55–56 is followed swiftly by the remark that the tribe of Levi did not participate in the census because it was not due to inherit (Num. 26:62). The requirement for the lot is repeated at Numbers 33:54 and 34:13, after which follows the arrangements for the cities and pasturelands in Numbers 35:1–8. This language is now picked up by the narrator in Joshua. The otherwise odd remark here that "the people of Joseph were two tribes" provides further explanation for the total of twelve tribes who find an inheritance when there is yet a further tribe excluded from this arrangement. The overall situation is thus accounted for, and Israel is found to be compliant, along with its leaders, Joshua and Eleazar.

<span id="page-447-15"></span><span id="page-447-14"></span><span id="page-447-13"></span>14:6–12 After this it might be thought odd that Caleb's inheritance does not come by lot. Clearly, however, Caleb's understanding is that the land for which he asks is his by promise. In verse 6 and again in verse 12 Caleb explicitly references a promise made to him by the Lord that a particular parcel of land should be his. In verse 9 this is expanded by way of confirmation of a word from Moses <span id="page-448-3"></span><span id="page-448-1"></span>in view of the wholehearted obedience Caleb showed not only on the occasion of spying out the land in Numbers 13–14 but throughout his long and faithful life (cf. Num. 32:12). The promise was not recorded in Numbers, where it might have been expected, but is reported by Moses on the plains of Moab as he begins a rehearsal of Israel's exodus experience as the conquest generation prepares to enter the land (Deut. 1:36; cf. Num. 14:24). By his behavior and his prospects in entering the land, Caleb's is a special case.

<span id="page-448-4"></span><span id="page-448-2"></span>Beyond his obedience lies a question of identity. As this story begins and ends (Josh. 14:6, 14) Caleb receives a full identification: "Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite." His membership in the tribe of Judah is only implied in the juxtaposition of the tribe's approach to Joshua with Caleb's request. Outside of this passage, his identification as a Kenizzite is found only at Numbers 32:12. Why should this affiliation be so noticeable here, then? It is common to associate the Kenizzites with a descendant of Esau, Kenaz, associated with the Edomites (Gen. 36:1–11, 40–43). At the very least, then, this identifier suggests an ancestry for Caleb that makes him a non-Israelite, yet one whose family is incorporated into Israel and whose exemplary and forceful fidelity marks him out as unparalleled in his generation. Not even Joshua, the designated successor to Moses, receives gets the approval accorded to Caleb.

<span id="page-448-5"></span><span id="page-448-0"></span>One theological nuance to Caleb's request might seem unusual. After Caleb sets out the basis for his request, points out God's promise, records his experience of God's faithfulness, and claims in no uncertain terms both his own vigor and his territory, his speech's climax seems remarkably halfhearted: "It may be that the Lord will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the Lord said" (Josh. 14:12). In spite of Caleb's grounds for confidence in God's gift and his own ability, his "It may be . . ." (Hb. *ʾulay*, "perhaps, maybe") might seem like a failure of nerve or a lack of confidence in God's provision. On the contrary, however, Caleb is leaving open some other way for God's promise to be realized, a mark of theological humility and a demonstration of an absence of spiritual presumption. Israel's God is under no constraint to behave in the manner in which Caleb anticipates he might. This is quite a different matter than doubting either God's capacity or his willingness; everything Caleb has seen of this God through his life reassures him that he is faithful to his word, and his "maybe" does not undermine that confidence.

<span id="page-448-6"></span>14:13–14 Joshua's blessing and assignment of the land granted to Caleb comes without need for casting lots. Although Caleb has referred to his hoped-for property as "this hill country" (v. 12), it is now twice identified as Hebron. Located to the south of the area associated with the settlement of Judah, Hebron retained its association with Caleb into David's time (1 Sam. 30:14).

<span id="page-448-8"></span><span id="page-448-7"></span>14:15 The narrator's final observations associate Hebron with "Kiriath-arba." If "arba" is related to the number four, it may refer to a tetrapolis, like Gibeon and its associated cities. This could in turn explain why his request for "cities" (Josh. 14:12) results in the grant of seemingly just one. The old name bears a further <span id="page-449-1"></span><span id="page-449-0"></span>association with the Anakim (cf. comment on 11:21–22). Just as on that previous occasion, the mention of the Anakim is partnered with a notice of "rest from war," repeating the phrase from 11:23.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-449-3"></span><span id="page-449-2"></span>Comparisons between Caleb and Joshua in the OT are never sharply drawn. They remain subtle, detected only with care. Some contrast seems to emerge with this narrative. Here Caleb's exemplary character is displayed not only by his autobiographical claim (14:8) but by the affirmative recognition of the narrator (14:14). Sandwiched between these notes of wholehearted devotion to the Lord is Caleb's plea in pursuit of the promise of God in the vigor of his old age. One must be alert to the danger of overreading, but this request appears to contrast with the prompting that Joshua required in his old age to be up and getting on with it (13:1). Of the different calls to perseverance that the book provides, this adds another: the note of urgency to persist in faithfulness "even to old age and gray hairs" (Ps. 71:18). Across centuries, Caleb's bold tenacity in realizing the promise of God resonates with that of the old apostle who "pressed on toward the goal . . . of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:14) and would later reflect on having "fought the good fight, . . . finished the race, . . . kept the faith" (2 Tim. 4:7).

<span id="page-449-7"></span><span id="page-449-6"></span><span id="page-449-4"></span>Caleb's Kenizzite status also calls for further reflection. The first part of the book gave prominent place to considering how both an individual with her family and a regional populace could find refuge among God's people. On any reckoning Caleb is an extraordinary Israelite, and yet it seems he, too, came from a family once alien to the people of God. While the second half of the book does not give equal prominence to the place of the foreigner among God's people, this theme is not absent and will be encountered again before the book concludes. The observation has been made previously that a close reading of Joshua repudiates the charges of xenophobia and genocide. Caleb's story as told here also contributes something to this rebuttal.

<span id="page-449-5"></span>A single word in Caleb's speech (Hb. *ʾulay*, "perhaps") was noticed in the comments above. It is just one word, but with it Caleb demonstrates his submission to a sovereign deity who is not bound to bring about the fulfillment of his promise in the way that mere creatures might hope for or expect. Once again we can see a Pauline parallel with Paul's own zealous commitment to know Christ Jesus in suffering and thus also to know the power of his resurrection, "that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead" (Phil. 3:11). Confidence in God's faithfulness can coexist peacefully with humility concerning the way in which that faithfulness will be shown. The joint witness of Caleb and the apostle Paul not only suggests the possibility of this combination but commends it.

15 The allotment for the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans reached southward to the boundary of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south. **2**And their south boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. **<sup>3</sup>** It goes out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, and goes up south of Kadesh-barnea, along by Hezron, up to Addar, turns about to Karka, **4**passes along to Azmon, goes out by the Brook of Egypt, and comes to its end at the sea. This shall be your south boundary. **5**And the east boundary is the Salt Sea, to the mouth of the Jordan. And the boundary on the north side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. **6**And the boundary goes up to Beth-hoglah and passes along north of Beth-arabah. And the boundary goes up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. **7**And the boundary goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. And the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh and ends at En-rogel. **<sup>8</sup>**Then the boundary goes up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem). And the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. **<sup>9</sup>**Then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron. Then the boundary bends around to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). **<sup>10</sup>**And the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to Beth-shemesh and passes along by Timnah. **11**The boundary goes out to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron, then the boundary bends around to Shikkeron and passes along to Mount Baalah and goes out to Jabneel. Then the boundary comes to an end at the sea. **12**And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans.

**<sup>13</sup>**According to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, Kiriatharba, that is, Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak). **14**And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak. **15**And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. **16**And Caleb said, "Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife." **17**And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. **18**When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she got off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" **<sup>19</sup>** She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have given me the land

of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

**<sup>20</sup>**This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans. **21**The cities belonging to the tribe of the people of Judah in the extreme south, toward the boundary of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, **22**Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, **23**Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, **24**Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, **25**Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor), **<sup>26</sup>**Amam, Shema, Moladah, **27**Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet, **<sup>28</sup>**Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, **29**Baalah, Iim, Ezem, **30**Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, **31**Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, **32**Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-451-2"></span><span id="page-451-1"></span><span id="page-451-0"></span>This account of the settlement of the tribe of Judah finds its introduction in Joshua 14:6, where the "people of Judah" approach Joshua to seek their allotment. The account of Caleb's request immediately follows, but now the story of the rest of the tribe unfolds. Caleb continues to feature prominently. The chapter falls into three main sections and concludes with a brief postscript. The regional boundaries of Judah's allotment are described with some care in the first section (15:1–12), and a detailed gazetteer of the cities contained in the region constitutes the third main section (vv. 20–62). Between them a brief narrative of Caleb again features, in this

<span id="page-452-9"></span>case joined by his daughter, Achsah (vv. 13–19). The laconic nature of this short story belies both its significance and the welter of issues it raises, partly on account of its brevity. The passage concludes with the slightly ominous note of the continuing presence within the tribal settlement of the Jebusites inhabiting Jerusalem (v. 63).

<span id="page-452-10"></span>By virtue of size and precedence, the account of the Judahite settlement achieves an undoubted prominence in the overall picture of Israel's occupation of the Promised Land. Still, an attentive reading is required to register the full implications of the narrator's choices in telling Judah's story in just this way. As will be seen, the account signals Judah's stature as not only the leading member of the tribal grouping but also one whose parameters make it the equal of the rest of the "nine and one-half tribes" (14:2) settling to the west of the Jordan.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-452-4"></span>15:1–12 For all the care lavished on the description of Judah's borders, the identity and location of a number of toponyms provided now elude identification. The overall trajectory of the account and the main outlines of the borders can be traced with reasonable confidence and are at least clear enough for the purposes of the record to be sustained. That is, the biblical account may not be identical to some administrative record that exhaustively maps territories in words, but it retains sufficient detail to convey the significance of those boundaries to later readers.

<span id="page-452-5"></span><span id="page-452-3"></span>The segments of the borders of Judah are described in a counterclockwise order, beginning with the southern border at its eastern edge, the south tip of the Dead Sea, describing a westward arc concluding at the Mediterranean coast (vv. 1–4). The description then returns to the Dead Sea, as its extent represents the eastern boundary (v. 5a). From the north end of the Dead Sea the northern boundary is described as an undulating line running westward, south of Jebus ("that is, Jerusalem"; v. 8), which is thus excluded from Judahite territory, terminating at the Mediterranean coast at the town of Jabneel, roughly halfway between Joppa to the north and Ashdod to the south (vv. 5b–11). The Mediterranean coast itself forms the natural western boundary (v. 12).

<span id="page-452-11"></span><span id="page-452-8"></span><span id="page-452-7"></span><span id="page-452-6"></span><span id="page-452-1"></span><span id="page-452-0"></span>The borders of other tribal territories will not be described in such detail (and those of Simeon, Issachar, and Dan are not described at all). Even here, the boundaries are not as distinctive as they might first appear. The southern boundary is essentially that of Canaan itself (cf. Num. 34:1–4), and the northern boundary is essentially the same demarcation as Benjamin's southern extent (Josh. 18:12–19). With the western boundary formed by the Mediterranean Sea (cf. Num. 34:6), the <span id="page-453-2"></span>distinctive element in this record is found at Joshua 15:5, which places the Dead Sea as the eastern boundary of Judah.

<span id="page-453-0"></span>Two features of this account should be noted. The first is the inclusivity of the boundary. Commentators sometimes rue the lack of a meaningful southern border for Judah and the somewhat optimistic reach westward to the Mediterranean. However, these boundaries coincide with the extent of land promised in earlier times, of which Numbers 34 is one key text. This inclines Judah's boundaries toward something like protonational borders, something more than a sharply circumscribed tribal allotment. The second feature to be noted is the exclusion of Jerusalem in Joshua 15:8, the explicit notice of its exclusion being absent from the parallel list relating to Benjamin in 18:16. Together with the final observation of the narrator regarding Judah's allotment in 15:63, again emphasizing that Jerusalem lies beyond the control of Judah, a perspective seems to be lurking that anticipates later developments concerning what will become the most important city of them all.

<span id="page-453-11"></span><span id="page-453-10"></span><span id="page-453-9"></span><span id="page-453-7"></span><span id="page-453-5"></span><span id="page-453-3"></span>15:13–19 The account of Caleb found here occurs again, with a few differences, in the opening chapter of Judges (Judg. 1:10–15). In Judges Caleb's role in "driving out" (Hb. *yarash*) the three sons of Anak is described as the sons' being "defeated" (*nakah*) at the hands of Judah. Othniel is referred to as Caleb's younger brother in Judges; this additional detail does not appear in Joshua. There are also some minor differences in wording in Hebrew. The chief difference between the accounts, of course, is their contexts. In Judges the vignette appears as one of a sequence of scenarios depicting Judah and then other tribes fighting against the Canaanites and introduces Othniel, who will become the ideal judge (Judg. 3:7–11). Here in Joshua this is an isolated account in the administrative record of Judahite territory, albeit one with an echo in the account of the settlement of Joseph, which includes a brief narrative featuring the daughters of Zelophehad (Josh. 17:3–6). Despite its brevity, or perhaps in part because of it, the text contains a number of difficulties regarding its relationship to the parallel text in Judges, the status of Othniel, the treatment of Achsah, and the legal context for the gifts from Caleb.114 The comments here focus on the present context.

<span id="page-453-8"></span><span id="page-453-6"></span><span id="page-453-4"></span>The brief account falls fairly naturally into three phases: (1) Caleb's actions (15:13–15); (2) Othniel's victory, which wins for him Achsah, Caleb's daughter, as his wife (15:16–17); and (3) Achsah's bold request of her father (15:18–19). Among the account's striking features is the insistent repetition of the verb "to give" (Hb. *natan*), found seven times in the space of these few verses and giving a heavy hint of the story's central theme.

<span id="page-453-1"></span>15:13–15 The account begins with a reprise of the traditions concerning Caleb, recounted at greater length in 14:6–15, picking out Caleb's membership in the

<sup>114</sup> On these and other issues arising in these verses see the treatment by Heidi M. Szpek, "Achsah's Story: A Metaphor for Societal Transition," *AUSS* 40/2 (2002): 245–256. For the intricate legal problems cf. Joseph Fleishman, "A Daughter's Demand and a Father's Compliance: The Legal Background to Achsah's Claim and Caleb's Agreement (Joshua 15,16–19; Judges 1,12–15)," *ZAW* 118 (2006): 354–373.

<span id="page-454-1"></span>tribe of Judah, his coming into holding the property of Hebron through the word of the Lord, and his defeat of the Anakim, here with the additional detail of the names of the three "sons," that is, descendants, of Anak. The preservation of this tradition adds a further note of antiquity to the ancient origins of the Anakim (cf. comment on 14:15).115 With Hebron secured, Caleb turns his attention to Debir (also named here as "Kiriath-sepher") and its inhabitants. Debir was one of the cities included in the southern campaign, the last of those said to have been defeated by "Joshua and all Israel" (10:38).116

<span id="page-454-8"></span><span id="page-454-2"></span><span id="page-454-0"></span>15:16–17 Persisting with the older name of "Kiriath-sepher," presumably the name by which the city was known to Caleb, Caleb's challenge goes out that the one who captures this city will be given Achsah, his daughter, "as wife." The narrator offers no clues as to why Caleb's sons do not continue the work of their father (cf. 1 Chron. 2:42–50; 4:15). Perhaps for this reason Caleb puts forward Achsah as the incentive to achieve two prizes: that land and this wife. The challenge he proposes carries an element of risk: "whoever" strikes and captures Kiriath-sepher could be anyone, and the feat is no guarantee of a worthy husband for his daughter. So Caleb's strategy strikes modern readers with an element of offense. His daughter appears to be commodified, dangled as a prize for a feat of derring-do. But Bronze Age fathers lacked modern scruples, and, in God's mercy, some good can come from a particular evil. Achsah, for her part, puts up no objection but rather, as will be seen, takes initiatives of her own to make the very best of the situation.

<span id="page-454-3"></span>In any event, Othniel rises to the challenge and is given Achsah as his wife. He is the "son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb" (Josh. 15:17), and seems to be made of the same stuff not only in terms of military prowess but also in his devotion to the Lord, as his exemplary judgeship implies (Judg. 3:9–10).

<span id="page-454-7"></span><span id="page-454-5"></span><span id="page-454-4"></span>15:18–19 In the third phase of the story Achsah herself comes into the foreground. Like Rahab, the book's most prominent female character, she takes on an active, even bold, role and is not content to remain passive. She may appear even more bold than most English versions imply.117 A bare rendering of the first part of Joshua 15:18 would read simply "When she came," with "to him" being supplied in translation. The supplied phrase anticipates the pronoun used with the following verb, "She urged *him* to ask her father." In this rendering she appears to be prodding Othniel to seek "a field" from her father. That the one who rose to the challenge of capturing Kiriath-sepher needs such prompting seems out of character, and is not required by the Hebrew. A different, and perhaps preferable, way of translating verse 18a would be, "When she arrived, she prodded him [i.e., Caleb] by asking her

<span id="page-454-6"></span><sup>115</sup> Cf. Hess, *Joshua*, 33. Hess identifies these as Hurrian names, attesting to the mixed population in the region.

<sup>116</sup> Now commonly identified with Khirbet Rabûd, about 8 miles (13 km) southwest of Hebron. Cf. Junkkaala, *Three Conquests of Canaan*, 240.

<sup>117</sup> The translation issues are treated in detail by Paul G. Mosca, "Who Seduced Whom? A Note on Joshua 15:18//Judges 1:14," *CBQ* 46/1 (1984): 18–22.

<span id="page-455-9"></span>father for a field." The verb "urged" (or "prodded") represents a verbal form of the Hebrew root *swt*, which typically has a negative connotation: "incited" (e.g., 2 Sam. 24:1; 1 Kings 21:25), "allured" (e.g., Job 36:16), or even "mislead" (e.g., Isa. 36:18). It is not necessary to attribute some deceptive intent to Achsah here; the sense is that she is required to use persuasive speech to move Caleb, seemingly against his will. Caleb responds with a terse, pointed question whose tone is difficult to discern, let alone capture in translation. There is no verb used, and perhaps the closest English idiom would be "What's with you?"

<span id="page-455-3"></span>The clustering in Joshua 15:19 of four of the seven uses of the verb "give" in this short story brings matters to a head. The landholdings already in Othniel's possession appear to be inadequate as productive, arable land. Achsah's request, then, is to be given "springs118 of water." Just as Rahab had sought a future for herself and her family, so too Achsah ensures that her possession with Othniel will contain the means to sustain life and to flourish. Caleb for his part responds generously, whether goaded into action by Achsah's persuasion or recognizing the shortcomings of the land he had gifted, providing two springs in response to Achsah's bold intervention.119 The daughter, like her father, ensures she settles well.

<span id="page-455-4"></span><span id="page-455-2"></span>15:20–62 With the account of Caleb, Othniel, and Achsah completed, the text returns to the settlement of the "people of Judah" (vv. 12, 20) as a whole. Attention is now given to the "cities with their villages" in which Judah settles. The description reads as a straightforwardly administrative account, and it falls into regular patterns. It moves district by district, each concluding with a summary total of cities. The districts are arranged into two roughly equivalent south-to-north panels, with verses 21–44 on Judah's western side (toward the Mediterranean) and verses 48–62 on the eastern side (toward the Jordan River). The pattern breaks in verses 45–47, in which Ekron, Ashdod, and Gaza fall outside any named district, lack a summary total, and appear to demarcate the north and west extremities of the tribal allotment.

<span id="page-455-7"></span><span id="page-455-6"></span><span id="page-455-5"></span><span id="page-455-1"></span>What are we to make of this remarkably full inventory of Judahite towns? As with the account of the borders in verses 1–12, there seems to be some significance in the attention to these details beyond a simple provision of data. The numbers are not provided for purposes of administration and accounting alone. The total of the cities tabulated in the summaries is 112 (excluding the three exceptions in vv. 45–47, which would bring the number to 115). Perhaps surprisingly, this total equals the number of cities enumerated for the rest of the tribes combined. Given that the number of cities named and the numbers given in total in the summaries do not always match, the summary numbers would seem to be intentionally balanced. Judah's regional holdings match those of the rest of the tribes combined.

<span id="page-455-8"></span><span id="page-455-0"></span><sup>118</sup> Hebrew *gullot* is used only here and in the parallel passage in Judges 1:15 ("springs"), for which the normal Hebrew word is *ʿayin* (e.g., Ex. 15:27). The word usually refers to a basin or bowl, so possibly Achsah's request is more for "pools of water" than "springs"; alternatively, the language of her request may be associated with the names of the water features, the "upper" and "lower" *gullot*.

<sup>119</sup> If the identification of Khirbet Rabûd with Debir/Kiriath-sepher is sustained, the account of its two nearby wells is striking. Cf. Moshe Kochavi, "Khirbet Rabûd = Debir," *TA* 1/1 (1974): 2–3, 29–30.

<span id="page-456-8"></span><span id="page-456-7"></span>15:63 Having lavished so much attention on what Judah does possess, the text ends on a somewhat somber note, meticulously recording a significant city, Jerusalem, and its inhabitants, the Jebusites, who could not be dispossessed. This skews the border (15:8) and blots the account of Judah's otherwise remarkable achievement. Jerusalem awaits a later moment, and Israel's greatest king, to be integrated into Judah as the national capital (2 Sam. 5:6–10).

#### <span id="page-456-11"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-456-1"></span>This lengthy, and for the most part administrative, account may make for tedious reading, but it contains matters of significance nonetheless. The bulk of the chapter maps in words the tribal borders and then adds a detailed inventory of its civic holdings. Together these convey the significance of Judah's settlement, reflected also in the priority of this account's coming first of all. Judah's borders echo in certain respect the boundaries of the Promised Land as a whole, and internally its provision is a match for the rest of the tribes combined. Judah's preeminence among the twelve tribes has been growing ever since the Joseph narrative, when its patriarch learns the meaning of repentance (Genesis 38) and demonstrates a remarkable transformation of character, developing from a leader in rage (Gen. 37:26–27) to the one prepared to sacrifice his life for the sake of his father and youngest brother (Gen. 44:18–34). In Jacob's blessing, Judah is accorded a striking and quasi-royal prominence (Gen. 49:8–12). In the wilderness encampment Judah is listed first (Num. 2:3) and sets out on march first (Num. 2:9). The account of Judah's allotment thus joins in this trajectory, as it will be Judah from which Israel's great king, chosen by Yahweh as a man "after his own heart" (1 Sam. 13:14; cf. Acts 13:22), shall also come. In a sense, Judah is here presented as a nation in embryo.

<span id="page-456-13"></span><span id="page-456-10"></span><span id="page-456-6"></span><span id="page-456-5"></span><span id="page-456-4"></span><span id="page-456-3"></span><span id="page-456-2"></span><span id="page-456-0"></span>Judah is also exemplary among the tribes as the only one of which it is said that it initiates with Joshua the giving of its allotment (Josh. 14:6), and that initiative is immediately paired with the request of Caleb to be granted his own settlement (14:6–12). What Judah does as a tribe thus finds its outstanding example in Caleb, and this continues into the narrative here. The embedding here of the account of Caleb, Othniel, and especially Achsah may seem odd, but it serves to root the national story in the lives of individuals, much as has been seen positively in Rahab and negatively in Achan in the preceding chapters. Although the brief vignette has for the careful reader a hint of frisson: Who will win Achsah in marriage? What is bothering Achsah? How will Caleb respond to her request? Both Othniel's responsiveness and Achsah's boldness bring the story to a satisfying conclusion. As is often remarked, this is a story of settling well, and it thus stands as a mute rebuke to other members of Israel that they do not seek such a settlement.

<span id="page-456-12"></span><span id="page-456-9"></span>It was not without its risks, of course. Caleb's dramatic challenge anticipates that of a later father, Jephthah, who makes a rash vow that leads not to ensuring his daughter's life but rather to her (implied) death (Judg. 11:30–31, 34–40). On Achsah's side, her briefly prominent role portrays her very much as the "excellent wife" (Hb. *ʾeshet hayil*) of Proverbs 31:10–31, actively taking initiative to provide <span id="page-457-3"></span>for her household in all circumstances as one who "considers a field and buys it" (Prov. 31:16). Modern readers may have qualms about how she comes to be a wife, but her actions in that role depict her as the female counterpart of her father.

<span id="page-457-1"></span><span id="page-457-0"></span>If there is a hint of warning in Caleb's rash vow, it is amplified in the two notices in this account of Jerusalem and of Judah's failure to take it (Josh. 15:8, 63). The superficial comparison between the books of Joshua, in which everything goes right, and Judges, in which it all goes wrong, can often be shown to be not only facile but misleading. The way the narrator has framed this best of the tribal allotment accounts demonstrates an acute eye, not only on the successes among God's people but on those lingering failures that will develop in such destructive ways as they are left to fester. These, then, are the narrator's stage whispers—quiet enough that we might miss them, loud enough that they should be heeded.

### <span id="page-457-2"></span>JOSHUA 16:1–17:18

16 The allotment of the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel. **2**Then going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites. **3**Then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea.

**<sup>4</sup>**The people of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.

**<sup>5</sup>**The territory of the people of Ephraim by their clans was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon, **<sup>6</sup>** and the boundary goes from there to the sea. On the north is Michmethath. Then on the east the boundary turns around toward Taanath-shiloh and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah, **<sup>7</sup>** then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, and touches Jericho, ending at the Jordan. **8**From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the brook Kanah and ends at the sea. Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Ephraim by their clans, **<sup>9</sup>** together with the towns that were set apart for the people of Ephraim within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages. **10**However, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived in the midst of Ephraim to this day but have been made to do forced labor.

17 Then allotment was made to the people of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. **<sup>2</sup>**And allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their clans.

**<sup>3</sup>**Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. **4**They approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, "The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers." So according to the mouth of the Lord he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father. **5**Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan, **6**because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh.

**<sup>7</sup>**The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. **8**The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim. **9**Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea, **<sup>10</sup>** the land to the south being Ephraim's and that to the north being Manasseh's, with the sea forming its boundary. On the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar. **<sup>11</sup>**Also in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Naphath.*<sup>1</sup>* **<sup>12</sup>**Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. **<sup>13</sup>**Now when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.

**<sup>14</sup>**Then the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a numerous people, since all along the Lord has blessed me?" **15**And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up by yourselves to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you." **<sup>16</sup>**The people of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us. Yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of Jezreel." **17**Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are a numerous people and have great power. You shall not have one allotment only, **18**but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-458-0"></span>The general south-to-north pattern in Joshua continues, as the settlement accounts move from the leading tribe of the south, Judah, to the leading "tribe" of the north, Joseph. A shared southern border is first plotted (16:1–3) before respective

<span id="page-459-9"></span><span id="page-459-8"></span><span id="page-459-5"></span><span id="page-459-1"></span>allotments are described, first Ephraim (16:5–10) then Manasseh (17:1–13), following their order of precedence rather than birth (cf. Gen. 48:14–20). Manasseh's account has embedded within it the conclusion to the record of the inheritance mandated for Zelophehad's daughters (Josh. 17:3–6), providing an echo of the Judah account of the land that went with Achsah in her marriage to Othniel (15:18–19). As the passage begins with "Joseph," so it ends (17:14–18), albeit on a querulous note, as Joshua is called upon to enlarge their portion. On the whole, there is much less detail provided for Ephraim and Manasseh than for Judah's settlement, but this will be the case for each of the tribes moving forward.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-459-6"></span>16:1–3 Only one boundary line for "Joseph" is described in these verses, the one partially shared by Ephraim and Manasseh. As was the case with the account of Judah's borders, the starting point for mapping territory is located near the juncture of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea. Here this happens to coincide with the point of entry of Israel into the Promised Land, narrated in chapters 3–4. From this point an undulating line is drawn westward to the Mediterranean coast.

<span id="page-459-7"></span><span id="page-459-4"></span>16:4 In spite of the clear precedence that Ephraim achieved over Manasseh, the order in which they are mentioned varies. The two census accounts in Numbers both introduce the sibling tribes as "Joseph" (Num. 1:32–35; 26:28–37), with Ephraim first in the earlier record but Manasseh first in the later one. Over the wilderness period Manasseh has also grown more numerous than Ephraim (cf. table 2.4)

<span id="page-459-3"></span><span id="page-459-2"></span>

Joshua 16:1–17:18 460

<span id="page-460-6"></span>16:5–9 The boundaries of Ephraim are plotted in a somewhat irregular fashion and are also left fairly notional. The first line roughly evokes the southern boundary already mapped in verses 1–3 (vv. 5–6a). Michmethath is then identified as the point marking the northernmost extent of Ephraim's territory; it appears to be just to the southeast of Shechem, perhaps 5 miles (8 km) or so. From this point the next line is drawn north-to-south, parallel to the Jordan River, terminating near Jericho (vv. 6b–7). The account then returns to the environs of Michmethath, as Tappuah lies southwest of it, and from this point a trajectory is plotted to the Mediterranean (v. 8a). The summary of verses 8b–9 provides no numeric tallies of cities and towns in Ephraimite possession.

<span id="page-460-9"></span><span id="page-460-8"></span><span id="page-460-7"></span>16:10 Just as the Judah record concluded with the note that Jerusalem lay beyond its control, so too the city of Gezer—an ancient and prominent toponym—continues to belong to Canaanites, who are nonetheless "made to do forced labor." Gezer comes under Israelite control in the biblical record as dowry to Solomon at his marriage with the daughter of the king of Egypt (1 Kings 3:1; 9:16).

<span id="page-460-13"></span><span id="page-460-10"></span><span id="page-460-0"></span>17:1–2 The turn to Manasseh brings with it in the first instance attention to people rather than place. The rest of the tribal accounts each include the phrase "by their clans," with small variations on a few occasions, but only in the case of Manasseh is any attention devoted to the identity of these clans. Two possible reasons may be suggested. Machir's origins go back to Egypt (Gen. 50:23) and during Moses' time achieved as a clan its settlement west of the Jordan in the Gilead, the region to the west of the Jordan for most of the extent between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee (Num. 32:39–40). Machir, described as a "man of war," appears to be analogous to Caleb. The second reason is the close associations with Zelophehad (cf. 1 Chron. 7:14–15), whose daughters play a significant role in Numbers and whose story concludes in Joshua 17:3–6. Thus the opening verses of the Manasseh settlement account link the portions of the tribe on both sides of the Jordan.

<span id="page-460-14"></span><span id="page-460-12"></span><span id="page-460-11"></span><span id="page-460-5"></span><span id="page-460-4"></span><span id="page-460-3"></span><span id="page-460-2"></span><span id="page-460-1"></span>17:3–6 The daughters of Zelophehad appear twice in the book of Numbers (Num. 27:1–11; 36:1–12). The very distribution of these episodes is significant for the structure of Numbers: they bracket the last section of the book, following on from the second census (Numbers 26) to the book's conclusion. Together, then, they frame the latter portion of the book, which moves toward settlement in the Promised Land, with the initiatives of these women, who deliberately seek an inheritance and memorial for sonless Zelophehad. It is a rare example of case law establishing a precedent for female inheritance in biblical law. As in the account of Caleb (cf. Josh. 14:9), in the present context a decision of the Lord delivered through Moses comes to be ratified by Joshua and, in this case, Eleazar (17:4)—and, as with Achsah (15:18–19), involves female characters. But these sisters' case differs from Achsah's, whose property comes through marriage and does not establish a legal precedent. On the other hand, both texts in their different ways highlight the initiative taken by women in Israel to achieve a lasting settlement. In practical terms, this conclusion to the notices of Zelophehad's daughters explains explicitly the reasons for settlement of these clans within the tribe of Manasseh on both sides of the Jordan (17:5).

<span id="page-461-7"></span><span id="page-461-6"></span><span id="page-461-5"></span><span id="page-461-4"></span>17:7–13 The territory of Manasseh west of the Jordan is described with some economy: shared borders are referred to by tribe, and the care in plotting precise demarcations declines—or the information available to the historian diminishes. Again the overall movement is from south to north, with verse 7a marking the extremities of its reach, but from Asher in the north to Michmethath in the south. The southern border is drawn from east to west in verses 7b–10, with the northern border described only in terms of the neighboring tribes to its north, Asher and Issachar. Verse 11 provides some inventory of cities of settlement, but verse 12 sounds the increasingly familiar note that Canaanites remain, beyond the power of Manasseh to dispossess. Like Ephraim in 16:10, Manasseh comes to subject these remaining Canaanites to forced labor (17:13).

<span id="page-461-15"></span><span id="page-461-13"></span><span id="page-461-12"></span><span id="page-461-11"></span><span id="page-461-10"></span><span id="page-461-9"></span><span id="page-461-8"></span><span id="page-461-3"></span><span id="page-461-1"></span>17:14–18 Israel came into a land to inhabit "great and good cities that you did not build" and to enjoy "vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant" (Deut. 6:10–12). That expectation appears to lie behind the complaint that the tribes of Joseph bring to Joshua. The initial complaint is over lack of space for so numerous a people (17:14). Joshua's solution is to spur them on to clearing forested (uncultivated) land and so provide for their many inhabitants (v. 15). Joseph sees a problem here: the hill country is rejected as being insufficient, which leads to a second complaint. They observe that the Canaanites living in the cities of the coastal plain have superior military technology, "chariots of iron," and are unassailable (v. 16; cf. 1 Sam. 13:19–21). Joshua shows no sympathy either for the complaint or for the line of reasoning presented (Josh. 17:17–18). What is regarded by the Joseph tribes as unfit for settlement, the "hill country," Joshua reckons as suitable for the effort of clearing and cultivation, giving them the space they desire within the boundaries of the allotment assigned to them. Nor does the supposed might of the Canaanites impress Joshua at all; as might be expected of this warrior, Joshua retains his confidence in the capacity of Israel to dispossess the Canaanites, as he has believed from the beginning (Num. 14:6–9).

#### <span id="page-461-14"></span><span id="page-461-0"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-461-2"></span>Correspondences are evident between the account of the Joseph settlement and that of Judah in Joshua 15, despite their even more marked differences. Machir and the daughters of Zelophehad evoke in a different, more muted register the dynamics of Caleb and Achsah. In spite of great gains, both cases display lingering failure, potentially sowing seeds of later damaging developments.

The most important reflections on the initiative of the daughters of Zelophehad belong to the book of Numbers, as indicated above. Still, they are here for a reason and are a further reminder of a long faithfulness in seeking God's best for God's people. It is their initiative that occasions a development in the law of Israel.

Such developments take place in later times, too, as situations arise for which the guidelines for faithful living appear to be opaque. On this third occasion of seeing the results of bold actions on the part of female characters in Joshua—so on every such occasion, then—the outcome works good for God's people. In the case of these seven daughters it is the impulse to justice that leads to their favorable settlement—and not only for them but for women similarly circumstanced who will come after them.

<span id="page-462-3"></span><span id="page-462-2"></span><span id="page-462-1"></span><span id="page-462-0"></span>A different trajectory is also at work in the final scenario of this Ephraim/ Manasseh account (Josh. 17:14–18). The only places that "blessing" is mentioned in the allotment accounts are with Caleb's being "blessed" from Joshua when he receives his inheritance (14:13), in Achsah's request to Caleb, to which he responds with generosity (15:19), and in the initial complaint of the Joseph tribes to Joshua (17:14). There is an element of irony here. The complaints show, on the one hand, a desire for the kind of settlement that would allow for flourishing, perhaps like that of Othniel and Achsah, only now on the level of the tribe rather than the clan or household. On the other hand, the complaint arises out of simple dissatisfaction and an unwillingness to apply themselves to achieving goals already in their grasp if they would only spend some effort to realize them. Once again, in a book with so much to celebrate, only a superficial reading would overlook elements such as this that anticipate, and in some way lay the foundation for, the scenes found in the opening chapters of Judges.

### <span id="page-462-4"></span>JOSHUA 18:1–10

18 Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The land lay subdued before them.

**2**There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned. **<sup>3</sup>** So Joshua said to the people of Israel, "How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land, which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you? **4**Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land. They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me. **5**They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall continue in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north. **6**And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the Lord our God. **7**The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the Lord is their heritage. And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them."

<span id="page-463-6"></span>**<sup>8</sup>** So the men arose and went, and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, "Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the Lord in Shiloh." **<sup>9</sup>** So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions. Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh, **<sup>10</sup>** and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord. And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel, to each his portion.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-463-4"></span><span id="page-463-3"></span>This brief but significant episode serves as the transition point in the account of the tribal settlements in chapters 13–21 (cf. Overview of 13:1–21:45). Without any fanfare the narrator relocates the main Israelite camp from Gilgal to Shiloh (18:1) and observes that seven tribes remain without land (v. 2). Joshua upbraids these tribes for dallying in the settlement process, outlining a plan for allocating a territory to each: tribal representatives will undertake a land survey and propose seven divisions (vv. 3–7). On the basis of this work Joshua will make the final assignments "before the Lord in Shiloh" (v. 8). A taut summary (vv. 9–10) reports that it was done.

<span id="page-463-7"></span><span id="page-463-5"></span>In spite of their fairly pedestrian appearance, these few verses mark a significant staging post in the move to Shiloh, draw into prominence the involvement of Yahweh in this final stage of land allotment, and signal a transition away from the primarily military nature of the settlement as it has been experienced up to this point.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-463-2"></span><span id="page-463-1"></span><span id="page-463-0"></span>18:1 Ever since Israel crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land (chs. 3–4), its base of operations has been the camp at Gilgal, near Jericho (4:19). There the people made themselves fit to occupy the land gifted to them by God (5:9, 10). To Gilgal they returned after the main regional military campaigns (10:15, 43), and from Gilgal the first distribution of tribal settlements took place (14:6). But Gilgal was only ever meant to be a temporary staging post as Israel gained a foothold in the land—a border outpost in a marginal zone.

<span id="page-464-7"></span>With Israel now well established in the land, even if not fully settled, a new and more geographically central location becomes the place of convocation. Shiloh is a sensible choice: located 11 miles (18 km) south of Shechem, in Ephraim, it is roughly in the middle of the major Judah/Joseph territories already allotted. This relocation is not simply practical, however. The notice that here Israel "set up the tent of meeting" provides the first of only two references to the tabernacle in the book of Joshua; the other reference (19:51) brackets this second phase of settlement. With Jerusalem playing no special role in the book—it is still a Canaanite enclave (15:63)—Shiloh is not only a geographical center but a religious one as well. Later tradition understands Shiloh to be the place of God's "dwelling" among his people (Ps. 78:60), and as late as the time of Jeremiah it is still remembered as the place "where I made my name dwell at first" (Jer. 7:12).120 Although the reference here is brief and understated, the impact made on the social memory of Israel is deep and lasting.

<span id="page-464-10"></span><span id="page-464-9"></span><span id="page-464-4"></span><span id="page-464-1"></span>The last clause of this deceptively simple verse likewise signals something of significance: "The land lay subdued before them." There will be no further military campaigns in the book. Although the settlements of Judah and Joseph entailed some military activity, such is absent from the account of the settling of the seven remaining tribes. The practice of *kherem* was last mentioned when the regional campaigns in the north came to a close (11:21), and from the land distribution at Shiloh forward warfare of any kind does not feature in Israelite settlement. Does Israel no longer seek to dispossess the Canaanites? Is there no further resistance? Or is the land now understood to be empty? The book of Joshua does not give an explicit answer to these questions, although Judges provides some further perspective on them and inclines toward the first of these explanations. Here, however, the notice that "the land lay subdued before them" implies its full subjugation. This same language was used by Moses as the condition that would release the Transjordan tribes from military service to return to their own settlements (Num. 32:22, 29). Likewise it forms part of David's encouragement to Solomon that he will enjoy the prospect of peace in which to construct the temple (1 Chron. 22:18). The verse marks not only geographic and religious transitions but a military transition as well.

<span id="page-464-8"></span><span id="page-464-5"></span><span id="page-464-3"></span><span id="page-464-2"></span><span id="page-464-0"></span>18:2 Of the "nine and one-half tribes" (Josh. 14:2) to settle west of the Jordan, only two and a half have received their territorial allotment; seven remain. Both tribal groups of "two and one-half" (14:3), east and west of the Jordan, that have already settled will be mentioned in Joshua's speech that follows. This provides a further balance, then, in the literary presentation of the tribal settlements.

<span id="page-464-6"></span>18:3–7 Joshua's opening gambit to the seven tribes has been called "more motivational than accusatory,"121 but the chiding tone is difficult to suppress. In "How long will you *put off*," the Hebrew has *mitrappim*; this form of the verb *raphah* is

Some sense of rebuke—much as Joshua himself received from the Lord in Joshua 13:1—would be felt in such a charge. Added to this is the way in which Joshua refers to the land as having been gifted by "the Lord, the God of your fathers." This precise designation of Israel's covenant God is the one used after the revelation of the divine name in Exodus 3:15–16; it is used eight times in Deuteronomy, typically with reference to God's promises of land in particular and, of these, twice precisely with the responsibility to take the land (Deut. 1:21; 4:1). It is used only here in Joshua, and once again in Judges 2:12 in conjunction with Israel's apostasy. Referring to the land as God's gift in this way emphasizes the lax attitude of the seven remaining tribes.

<span id="page-465-5"></span><span id="page-465-2"></span>Joshua's plan involves tribal representatives' mapping the remaining territory into seven divisions and submitting the boundary descriptions to Joshua, who will "cast lots . . . before the Lord" (cf. comment on 14:1–5) and so assign them to these tribes. Joshua also confirms the territories of those who have already received land in their two sets—Judah and Joseph to the west of the Jordan in the familiar south/north order and the two and a half tribes to the east—and once again excludes the tribe of Levi from receiving an inheritance.

<span id="page-465-10"></span>18:8–10 The survey is undertaken, the representatives return, and Joshua apportions the divisions to the tribes. No time frame is placed on these activities by the narrator. The issue now is not how long they took but that the task is undertaken and completed.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-465-0"></span>An intriguing connection has often been observed between the way this passage begins, that the "land [*ʾerets*] lay subdued [*nikbeshah*] before them" (v. 1), and the creation mandate in Genesis 1:28, "fill the earth [*ʾerets*] and subdue it [*kibshuha*]." Both use forms of the verb *kabash* with reference to the *ʾerets* ("earth/land"). Although the resonance between these two texts is subtle, it is suggestive. The creation intention that God's human creatures should be stewards of a flourishing natural world finds a partial fulfillment in Israel as the curators of the Land of Promise—and, with the relocation of the tabernacle in the same moment, there is, as in the garden, a meeting place for God and his people.

<span id="page-465-9"></span><span id="page-465-8"></span><span id="page-465-7"></span><span id="page-465-6"></span><span id="page-465-4"></span>Two words recur with some frequency through these ten verses, both of which are names: "Shiloh" is named four times (Josh. 18:1, 8, 9, 10) and Yahweh (= "Lord") six times (18:3, 6, 7 [2x], 8, 10). The former has been discussed above; the latter deserves some notice too by way of response. Yahweh featured at various points in the preceding land allotment in chapters 14–17, in particular in connection with Caleb's settlement (e.g., 14:6, 8, 12), but also with Zelophehad's daughters (17:4) and the wider tribes of Joseph (17:14). As the account of the assignment of the portions to the seven remaining tribes unfolds, such references are conspicuous <span id="page-466-2"></span>by their absence; Yahweh will not be named again until the brief report of Joshua's own settlement in 19:50 and in the final summary of this section in 19:51 (cf. comment there). God remains involved in this distribution, but his contribution is contained in the actions taken at Shiloh: God has gifted the land, and the casting of lots is done "before the Lord" (18:6, 8, 10). Thus God has directed; it remains for his people to act on that direction.

<span id="page-466-0"></span>Three elements thus come together in this brief but pivotal passage: land "subdued," divine direction given, and work yet still to be done. Victory has been won, but the task remains incomplete. There is a call here for the perseverance of the saints. John Piper reflects on reasons Christians "might grow weary of the battle and consider giving up on Christianity." As an encouragement, he points to the fact that

the victory is assured. Our assurance is not destroyed by the demands for endurance. The key to assurance is not to eliminate the biblical commands for endurance, but rather to magnify grace as a future power to believe, as well as a past pardon for sin."122

This is the situation in which Israel finds itself here, poised in the midst of coming into the inheritance it has received as God's gift but as a nation not yet having found rest. For the Christian the terms are shifted, but the dynamic is the same. God has given, the victory is won, and there is still work yet to do. This is well summed up in 2 Peter 1:3–5 (cf. v. 10):

<span id="page-466-3"></span>His divine power has granted [*dedōrēmenēs*, perfect tense] to us all things that pertain to life and godliness . . . he has granted [*dedōrētai*, perfect tense] to us his precious and very great promises. . . . For this very reason, make every effort . . .

**<sup>11</sup>**The lot of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to its clans came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. **12**On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan. Then the boundary goes up to the shoulder north of Jericho, then up through the hill country westward, and it ends at the wilderness of Beth-aven. **13**From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the shoulder of Luz (that is, Bethel), then the boundary goes down to Ataroth-addar, on the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon. **14**Then the boundary goes in another

direction, turning on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south, opposite Beth-horon, and it ends at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city belonging to the people of Judah. This forms the western side. **15**And the southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim. And the boundary goes from there to Ephron,*<sup>1</sup>* to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. **16**Then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim. And it then goes down the Valley of Hinnom, south of the shoulder of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel. **17**Then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh, and from there goes to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim. Then it goes down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, **<sup>18</sup>** and passing on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-arabah*<sup>2</sup>* it goes down to the Arabah. **19**Then the boundary passes on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-hoglah. And the boundary ends at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this is the southern border. **20**The Jordan forms its boundary on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the people of Benjamin, according to their clans, boundary by boundary all around.

**<sup>21</sup>**Now the cities of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to their clans were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, **22**Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, **23**Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, **24**Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, Geba twelve cities with their villages: **25**Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, **26**Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, **27**Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, **28**Zela, Haeleph, Jebus*<sup>3</sup>* (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah*<sup>4</sup>* and Kiriath-jearim*<sup>5</sup>*—fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the people of Benjamin according to its clans.

19 The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the people of Simeon, according to their clans, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the people of Judah. **2**And they had for their inheritance Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, **3**Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, **4**Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, **5**Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, **<sup>6</sup>**Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen—thirteen cities with their villages; **7**Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities with their villages, **<sup>8</sup>** together with all the villages around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negeb. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Simeon according to their clans. **9**The inheritance of the people of Simeon formed part of the territory of the people of Judah. Because the portion of the people of Judah was too large for them, the people of Simeon obtained an inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.

**<sup>10</sup>**The third lot came up for the people of Zebulun, according to their clans. And the territory of their inheritance reached as far as Sarid. **<sup>11</sup>**Then their boundary goes up westward and on to Mareal and touches Dabbesheth, then the brook that is east of Jokneam. **12**From Sarid it goes in the other direction eastward toward the sunrise to the boundary of Chisloth-tabor. From there it goes to Daberath, then up to Japhia. **13**From there it passes along on the east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and going on to Rimmon it bends toward Neah, **<sup>14</sup>** then on the north the boundary turns about to Hannathon, and it ends at the Valley of Iphtahel; **<sup>15</sup>** and Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem twelve cities with their villages. **16**This is the inheritance of the people of Zebulun, according to their clans—these cities with their villages.

**17**The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the people of Issachar, according to their clans. **18**Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, **<sup>19</sup>**Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, **20**Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, **21**Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, Beth-pazzez. **22**The boundary also touches Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and its boundary ends at the Jordan sixteen cities with their villages. **23**This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Issachar, according to their clans—the cities with their villages.

**24**The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the people of Asher according to their clans. **25**Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, **26**Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west it touches Carmel and Shihor-libnath, **<sup>27</sup>** then it turns eastward, it goes to Beth-dagon, and touches Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel. Then it continues in the north to Cabul, **28**Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, as far as Sidon the Great. **29**Then the boundary turns to Ramah, reaching to the fortified city of Tyre. Then the boundary turns to Hosah, and it ends at the sea; Mahalab,*<sup>6</sup>* Achzib, **30**Ummah, Aphek and Rehob twenty-two cities with their villages. **31**This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Asher according to their clans—these cities with their villages.

**<sup>32</sup>**The sixth lot came out for the people of Naphtali, for the people of Naphtali, according to their clans. **33**And their boundary ran from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan. **34**Then the boundary turns westward to Aznoth-tabor and goes from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun at the south and Asher on the west and Judah on the east at the Jordan. **<sup>35</sup>**The fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, **<sup>36</sup>**Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, **37**Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, **38**Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh—nineteen cities with their villages. **39**This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Naphtali according to their clans—the cities with their villages.

**40**The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the people of Dan, according to their clans. **41**And the territory of its inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, **<sup>42</sup>** Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, **43**Elon, Timnah, Ekron, **<sup>44</sup>**Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, **<sup>45</sup>** Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, **<sup>46</sup>** and Me-jarkon and Rakkon with the territory over against Joppa. **47**When the territory of the people of Dan was lost to them, the people of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and after capturing it and striking it with the sword they took possession of it and settled in it, calling Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor. **48**This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Dan, according to their clans—these cities with their villages.

**<sup>49</sup>**When they had finished distributing the several territories of the land as inheritances, the people of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun. **50**By command of the Lord they gave him the city that he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he rebuilt the city and settled in it.

**<sup>51</sup>**These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel distributed by lot at Shiloh before the Lord, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-469-4"></span><span id="page-469-0"></span>In spite of some regularities in the settlement accounts in Joshua 15–17, no stable formula was established for reporting the districts into which the tribes moved. Likewise here there is some similarity between accounts, especially relating to city inventories, but considerable variation in the reports of apportioning of territories to these seven remaining tribes. Boundary lines are described with sometimes more, sometimes less, detail, sometimes preceded by city inventories, sometimes followed by them (and in the case of Asher, both). The "lot" is chosen first for Benjamin (18:11–28), and the report of its territory most closely resembles those of Judah and Joseph from the Gilgal distribution. Its account is by far the longest of the remaining tribes. Then follow the reports concerning Simeon (19:1–9), Zebulun (19:10–16), Issachar (19:17–23), Asher (19:24–31), and Naphtali (19:32–39), with the last of the remaining seven, Dan (19:40–48), involving something of an odd case of failed inheritance. Following the typical pattern, the sequence moves roughly from south to north; Dan, although initially allocated land in the central western region, finally settles as the northernmost tribe of all.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-469-6"></span><span id="page-469-5"></span><span id="page-469-3"></span><span id="page-469-2"></span><span id="page-469-1"></span>18:11–28 Benjamin is a Rachel tribe, à la the Joseph tribes (Ephraim and the halftribe of Manasseh), who settled in chapters 16–17. The lot places Benjamin on Judah's northern border. As in the earlier accounts, especially that of Judah, a very full description of boundary lines is provided here (18:11–20), including a repeat of the boundary shared with Judah, already recounted in chapter 15. A list follows of cities incorporated into the district (18:21–28). One of the striking features of this account is the way in which the holdings of Benjamin and Judah are seen to interpenetrate, even though the division of land seems clear. Verse 14 describes Kiriath-jearim as within Benjamin's territory, but its civic membership lies with Judah. Similarly, "Jebus (that is, Jerusalem)," falling just outside Judah's border in 15:8; 18:16 and so belonging to Benjamin, nonetheless seems to be associated with Judah. These anomalies are registered without further comment or evaluative judgment from the narrator.

<span id="page-470-3"></span>19:1–39 The accounts of the next five tribal settlements—Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali—provide a mix of profiles and strategies of reportage. Simeon is the most unusual, having no defined borders but instead making its home within the territory of Judah, "because the portion of the people of Judah was too large for them" (v. 9). Thus it has a record only of city allocations. With Simeon settled in the south, the rest of this group makes its home to the north of Manasseh's territory, above the Valley of Jezreel.

<span id="page-470-6"></span><span id="page-470-5"></span><span id="page-470-4"></span>19:40–48 The case of the Danites is both the last and the strangest of the tribal settlements—or, rather, nonsettlement. After the lot assigns to them a territory with cities running eastward inland from the environs of Joppa, a brief notice confirms that "the territory of the people of Dan was lost to them" (v. 47a), using the Hebrew idiom *yatsaʾ* ("go out") plus *min* ("from"), sometimes translated "slipped from their grasp" (e.g., JPS). The form of words leaves Dan surprisingly passive in this loss, and no explanation is offered. Dan becomes active in recovering some territory for itself in verse 47b. Its new home is in the far north, opposite Mount Hermon, and taking it involves military action. This, however, is not part of the post-Shiloh settlement but rather follows sometime later, as the more detailed and troubling—parallel account in Judges makes clear (cf. Judg. 18:1, 7–10).

<span id="page-470-16"></span><span id="page-470-15"></span><span id="page-470-14"></span><span id="page-470-13"></span><span id="page-470-9"></span><span id="page-470-8"></span><span id="page-470-7"></span>19:49–50 The land grant to Caleb by divine promise (14:9–12) and command (Hb. *ʾel pi yhwh*; 15:13) began the account of Israel's settlement, and now the land grant to Joshua by divine command (*ʿal pi yhwh*; 19:50) concludes it. This allocation to Joshua contains something of a role reversal, as now it is the Israelites who give Joshua a portion (v. 49). The same language is used of the "people of Israel" giving Levi its cities (21:3, 8; cf. 1 Chron. 6:64 [6:49 MT]); these are the only occasions in which the people of Israel are said to give anything. This too is a signal that the inheritance is complete and that possession of the land has now, under God, come to Israel.

<span id="page-470-12"></span><span id="page-470-11"></span>As noticed above in relation to Caleb, that faithful warrior has much more attention paid to him than does Joshua here. There is no indication anywhere that Joshua has any family; he is a lone figure, whose life is wholly bound up with his calling to lead God's people into the Land of Promise (cf. comment on 24:14–15). Timnath-serah is roughly 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Shechem and 8 miles (13 km) north of Lower and Upper Beth-horon, on the Ephraimite border. It borders the Valley of Aijalon, where Joshua won a dramatic victory over the Amorites (10:12–14). Joshua's own vigor and initiative may not be as prominent in this pithy notice as Caleb's were in his more expansive accounts, but the note that Joshua "rebuilt the city and settled in it" (19:50) is at least a gesture in that direction.

<span id="page-470-10"></span><span id="page-470-2"></span><span id="page-470-1"></span><span id="page-470-0"></span>19:51 The final summary notice of the activity of Eleazar and Joshua at Shiloh concludes the settlement of the seven remaining tribes (cf. 18:1). Only here is it explicitly recorded that the distribution by "lot" took place "before the Lord, at the entrance of the tent of meeting." This is a precise and significant location. In Exodus 29:42, in the instructions Moses receives from God for the construction of the tabernacle, the "entrance" is designated as the place "where I will meet with you, to speak to you there." And so it proves to be on many occasions. Here the additional detail reinforces the sense that, although God's presence is not a narrative feature of this phase of settlement, said settlement nonetheless takes place in accord with his purpose and plan.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-471-0"></span>The literary shaping of the Shiloh phase of the distribution of the land is clearly signaled in the echoes between Joshua 18:1 and 19:51. The allocation by "lot" and "before the Lord" lends a quasi-prophetic aspect to the proceedings. And yet the narrator has not crafted an idealized picture either of the settlement of the remaining tribes or of the land inheritance of Israel as a whole. If anything, the surface details of this passage imply something like the opposite. Simeon's territory is a nonterritory, a clutch of cities carved out of another tribe's domain. Those tribes settling to the north see their regions only patchily reported. The last of the tribes to settle, Dan, fails to hold its divinely allocated portion and goes rogue, although the narrator here is restrained enough not to put this point too sharply, leaving it to the book of Judges. There is a tension in the crafting of the account in just this form, as we see the provision and aspirations for the ideal infused with the partial and problematic of the real. The vagaries of the literary landscape are resolutely retained. It will take an Ezekiel, centuries later, to reimagine an idealized version. Here Israel inhabits the Land of Promise, its settlement characterized by quirks and defects—yet at the same time the nation is poised to live as the people of God in the place in which he has put them.

### <span id="page-471-1"></span>JOSHUA 20:1–9

20 Then the Lord said to Joshua, **<sup>2</sup>** "Say to the people of Israel, 'Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses, **<sup>3</sup>** that the manslayer who strikes any person without intent or unknowingly may flee there. They shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood. **4**He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city. Then they shall take him into the city and give him a place, and he shall remain with them. **5**And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not give up the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unknowingly, and did not hate him in the past. **6**And he shall remain in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of him who is high priest at the time. Then the manslayer may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.' "

<span id="page-472-9"></span>**<sup>7</sup>** So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. **8**And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh. **9**These were the cities designated for all the people of Israel and for the stranger sojourning among them, that anyone who killed a person without intent could flee there, so that he might not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, till he stood before the congregation.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-472-1"></span><span id="page-472-0"></span>The first asylum seeker in the Bible was Cain, whose life was preserved by God in his fugitive state (Gen. 4:13–15). A mechanism for regularizing asylum in the case of manslaughter was part of God's plan for the life of his people in the Promised Land as early as Exodus 21:12–14, where "a place" is promised for this purpose and the provision of altar asylum implied. Prior to this moment immediately following Israel's settlement, full statements of the conditions and procedure for city asylum in cases of manslaughter were given at Numbers 35:9–34 and again at Deuteronomy 19:1–13. This passage in Joshua reflects the wording of these earlier texts at certain points. Here the concern is more with the identification of the cities of refuge than with procedure, which receives more attention in the earlier passages, although a brief statement of purpose and legal process is also included.

<span id="page-472-8"></span><span id="page-472-4"></span><span id="page-472-3"></span><span id="page-472-2"></span>Joshua 20:1–6, then, contains the final divine speech to Joshua in the book, comprising direct reminders of the instructions already given to Moses to provide "cities of refuge" (Num. 35:1). Joshua 20:7–8 names three cities on each side of the Jordan. Verse 9 adds a full summary for such a brief passage and includes the further detail that the provision of asylum is for native and sojourner alike.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-472-7"></span><span id="page-472-6"></span><span id="page-472-5"></span>20:1 Once again, and for the last time recorded in the book, the Lord addresses Joshua (cf. comments on 1:2; 13:1). For some reason the narrator varies the speech formula: rather than the familiar Hebrew *wayyoʾmer yhwh ʾel* ("and the Lord said to"; e.g., 1:1), these words are introduced by *wayedabber yhwh ʾel* ("the Lord said to"). The more restricted pattern seems to be associated with more strongly directive statements in somewhat stereotyped settings, although no hard and fast distinction can be drawn. Still, the variation of formula sets this divine statement apart from the rest in the book.

<span id="page-473-11"></span><span id="page-473-8"></span>20:2–6 While the Lord addresses Joshua with the reminder of the command earlier given to Moses, the instruction is intended for the "people of Israel," and "they" will make the allocations in verses 7–8. A consistent feature of the provision of the cities of refuge is that eligibility is restricted to manslaughter and thus does not apply to any other form of asylum seeking. The conditions are stated here in verses 3 and 5 and again in the summary of verse 9. They display a notable relationship with the earlier texts (cf. table 2.5).

<span id="page-473-9"></span><span id="page-473-0"></span>TABLE 2.5: Conditions of Manslaughter

<span id="page-473-4"></span><span id="page-473-2"></span>

|                                                     | Numbers | Deuteronomy | Joshua  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1. bishegagah = "without intent"                    | 35:11   |             | 20:3, 9 |
| 2. bibli daʿat = "unintentionally"                  |         | 4:42; 19:4  | 20:3    |
| 3. loʾ soneʾ mitemol = "did not<br>previously hate" |         | 4:42; 19:4  | 20:5    |

<span id="page-473-6"></span><span id="page-473-1"></span>Numbers 35 sets out the representative actions that qualify as either murder or manslaughter, while Deuteronomy 19 provides a smaller set of such instances. The summary condition of Numbers 35:11, that the action that occasions death occurred *bishegagah* ("without intent"), is different from simple absence of intent and is close to the restatement of Deuteronomy, that it occurred *bibli daʿat* ("unintentionally") or, in both cases, "unawares." That is, it was purely accidental. The third condition might at first glance appear to be without malice aforethought, but this simply stipulates that the "manslayer" had no previous record of enmity with the deceased.

The process thus ensures that private vengeance does not further pollute the land nor contribute to an escalation of injustice in Israel. It does not assume or ensure the innocence of the one who flees to escape a vendetta killing, but rather ensures that justice will be done when due judicial process has taken place. Somewhat akin the case of Cain, who was protected while wandering, continued and enforced residence in the city of refuge is itself a punishment for causing a neighbor's untimely death—it is a sort of exile.

The first slate of three cities (Josh. 20:7) comes from among the tribal settlements west of the Jordan and proceeds from north to south, the reverse of the typical pattern in Joshua. Kedesh, in the region of Naphtali, is about 16 miles (26 km) north of the Sea of Galilee. Shechem is centrally located but toward the southern border of Manasseh in the hill country of Ephraim. Hebron is in the south, part of Caleb's inheritance in 14:14. The Transjordan cities (20:8), previously named in Deuteronomy 4:43, are listed from south to north in the manner typical of the book. None of the three has been identified with certainty. Bezer in the "wilderness on the tableland" probably aligns roughly with the north end of the Dead Sea, but some distance to the east. Ramoth in Gilead is in Gad's territory. Joshua 20:1–9 474

In the north, Golan beneath Bashan roughly aligns with the Sea of Galilee, laying some way east.

<span id="page-474-4"></span><span id="page-474-3"></span>20:9 The extended summary includes material from Numbers 35:12, 15, adding the inclusion of the sojourner in the provision of the asylum cities. In ending with these details and repeating the necessity of standing "before the congregation" to receive justice, the narrator accomplishes at least two things: First, this elevates asylum in the newly settled land, emphasizing the practice of justice in the new nation. Second, it signals obedience to the Lord's decree, a running theme in the settlement texts.

<span id="page-474-2"></span><span id="page-474-1"></span><span id="page-474-0"></span>As noted in the introduction to this passage, Cain is the earliest asylum seeker for homicide, but there is a nearer case: Moses, too, fled to find safety after killing an Egyptian (Ex. 2:11–15). Moses' action was not accidental, but it could qualify for asylum under the "did not previously hate" condition (cf. table 2.5). For him Midian provided refuge and a home for forty years until "the king of Egypt died" (Ex. 2:23), much as the death of the high priest would occasion release for the manslayer here.123 Such cases are now provided for in Israel's landscape. There are as yet no courts, but there is at least the possibility that the life of one who in innocence shed innocent blood would not be taken in wrongful vengeance. In the Genesis account God hears the cry of innocent blood: "The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground" (Gen. 4:10), and asylum is offered to the killer. The writer to the Hebrews comments on this blood-spoken word in reflecting on the situation of Abel (Heb. 11:4), concluding that Jesus' blood "speaks a better word than the blood of Abel" (Heb. 12:24). Those responsible for Jesus' death are given much greater provision than asylum: for them—for us—there is the possibility of salvation.

<span id="page-476-3"></span><span id="page-476-2"></span><span id="page-476-1"></span>Levi's exclusion from the territorial allotment has been noted throughout the settlement account (cf. comment on 13:14, 33; cf. also Josh. 14:3–4; 18:7). The command to provide cities for Levi to inhabit was given by the Lord through Moses (Numbers 35:2, 6–8). Deuteronomy is subsequently concerned for the care and maintenance of the Levites, who are without their own inheritance (Deut. 10:9; 12:12; 14:27; 18:1), while elsewhere in Numbers attention to the Levites has more to do with their duties and responsibilities. With the land now apportioned among the inheriting tribes, the time has come for Israel to allocate cities for the Levites in accord with the parameters of the command in Numbers 35, attending in particular to the total provision of forty-eight cities. The list here bears a close relationship to that provided in 1 Chronicles 6:54–81 as an appendix to the genealogy of Levi.

Verse 8 introduces the detailed breakdown of the identities of the cities given by the inheriting tribes in verses 9–40, still organized by the Levitical clans and in the same order as provided in the summary verses.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-477-3"></span><span id="page-477-0"></span>21:1–3 The approach of the leaders of the clans of Levi to Eleazar and Joshua in verses 1–2 matches closely the approach of the daughters of Zelophehad in 17:4. On both occasions the time has come to implement divine decision made earlier in the wilderness period. Whereas Zelophehad's daughters receive their inheritance in the Gilgal phase of land settlement, the clan of Levi receives its non-inheritance of cities from Shiloh (v. 2), the explicit naming of that location a reminder of Israel's still new central place of convocation (cf. 19:51).

<span id="page-477-10"></span><span id="page-477-6"></span><span id="page-477-5"></span><span id="page-477-4"></span><span id="page-477-1"></span>21:4–7 It might have been sufficient to move directly to the catalog of cities pertaining to the Levitical clans, but it is delayed while a summary of the divisions and the donating tribes is outlined. This provides a sort of table of contents for the detailed list that follows from verse 9, which remains a helpful overview for later readers. The Kohathites, the subclan of the descendants of Aaron "the priest" (v. 4)—this status being crucial for the position of eminence here—are provided with homes in the environs of Jerusalem, although Jerusalem itself remains outside of Israel's control. The rest of the Kohathites receive their cities along the border to the north of Judah (v. 5). The Gershonites and Merarites are distributed across the northern and Transjordan tribes (vv. 6–7). This leaves the central region remarkably underrepresented, with Shechem (v. 21), one of the cities of refuge, notable among the exceptions.

<span id="page-477-12"></span><span id="page-477-9"></span><span id="page-477-8"></span><span id="page-477-7"></span>21:8–40 The details of this distribution are now provided. The tribal contributions bear a remarkable symmetry:

<span id="page-477-13"></span><span id="page-477-11"></span><span id="page-477-2"></span>One of the most prominent points of relative consensus on the nature of the Levitical Cities List is its fundamentally schematic structure (at least in Joshua 21) that, with a few exceptions, assigns four cities from each tribe. . . . The three exceptions are Judah and Simeon, who are listed together and whose collective contribution adds up to nine cities (Josh. 21:13–16; cf. 1 Chron. 6:[39–41], 42–44), and Naphtali, which donates only three cities (Josh. 21:32 = 1 Chron. 6:61). The overwhelming regularity of this system, in which most of the tribes donate a fixed number of cities (9 tribes × 4 cities = 36) and the other three a commensurate number between them (9 + 3 = 12 cities, averaging 4 apiece), is too obvious to miss.124

<span id="page-478-1"></span>Another feature of note in this scheme is the integration of the cities of refuge among the Levitical cities. This was already incorporated into the command of Moses in Numbers 35:6, that the total number cities for Levi should comprise the six asylum cities, plus a contribution of a further forty-two. Here they appear as Hebron (Josh. 21:13)—the mention of which occasions a detour recalling its assignment to Caleb—Shechem (v. 21), Golan (v. 27), Kedesh (v. 32), Bezer (v. 36), and Ramoth in Gilead (v. 38).

<span id="page-478-7"></span><span id="page-478-6"></span><span id="page-478-5"></span><span id="page-478-4"></span>21:41–42 The language of the summary reverts to that of the introduction to the chapter, providing a sense of closure as well as reinforcing the implication of obedience on Israel's part in carrying through on these civic assignments.

#### *Response*

At least two aspects of this passage are immediately apparent: its ideal schematization and the incorporation of the cities of refuge into the allocation of Levitical cities. Both contribute to the nation building of Israel at the moment of its inception in the Land of Promise.

<span id="page-478-8"></span>In the biblical story Israel has grown from the family of Jacob in Genesis to the nation now settled into the landscape of the patriarchal sojourning. The narrator will reflect on this remarkable moment in the following brief passage, but this designation of cities as a joint project by the twelve settled tribes for the non-inheriting tribe of Levi forges the entire people into one integrated whole. In this context the list of Levitical cities is much more than an administrative record of the kind found in the corresponding passage of 1 Chronicles 6. Here there is a clear narrative context and trajectory, beginning not from the process of settlement in this macrosection of Joshua but all the way back from the promises to Abraham and the election of Israel in the book of Genesis. The close context in the book of Joshua, however, accounts to some degree for the presentation of the city list here. In the first part of the book the Levitical priests bear the ark of God in the midst of the nation (chs. 3–4, 6), and now with their distributed presence they bear still, in a more diffuse way, God's presence among his people, for whom they serve as custodians of spiritual welfare (Ex. 32:29; Num. 8:19; cf. Deut. 10:8).

<span id="page-478-3"></span><span id="page-478-2"></span><span id="page-478-0"></span>If the schematized presentation lends a sense of unity to this new nation, the blending of the cities of asylum with their further civic spaces makes the Levites not only custodians of Israel's spiritual welfare but also to some extent guardians of justice before any other judicial institutions have been established. Whether there is merit to the suggestion that the adjudication of the case of the fugitive

manslayer had a paradigmatic function,125 this remains a powerful tool for inculcating the deliberation of the community in seeking just outcomes in these cases of death and life. It is not too much of a stretch to see these as leading Israel on a path to discern just outcomes in lesser cases, too.

<span id="page-479-4"></span><span id="page-479-0"></span>The responsibility, provision, and privilege of Levi is connected by Stephen Williams to the designation of Israel in Exodus 19:6 as a "kingdom of priests."126 As the Levitical priesthood was to Israel, so Israel was among the nations. Peter finds in this phrase something that applies to the NT people of God: the identity of the NT church, too, involves being a "royal priesthood" (1 Pet. 2:9). This comes with a purpose: to display the "excellencies of him who called you" to a watching world. The distribution of Levi throughout the territories of Israel and especially at its boundaries sets a suggestive trajectory for the Peter's identification of the church with Israel's "royal priesthood," as it too lives out and attests to a standard of justice and righteousness needed in a world prone to asserting self-seeking rights regardless of the cost to the wider community.

### <span id="page-479-3"></span>JOSHUA 21:43–45

**<sup>43</sup>**Thus the Lord gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their fathers. And they took possession of it, and they settled there. **44**And the Lord gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers. Not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the Lord had given all their enemies into their hands. **45**Not one word of all the good promises that the Lord had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.

#### *Section Oerview*

<span id="page-479-2"></span><span id="page-479-1"></span>The second major section of the book, chapters 13–21, now concludes with a ringing statement of God's faithfulness. In the corresponding passage in this carefully arranged section, 13:1–7, God himself spoke to remind Joshua of the necessity to possess the land, pressing a leader, who was perhaps tired and lingering, into action. Now it is done—and the narrator's summary reflects entirely on the complete faithfulness of Israel's God in fulfilling his promises to his people.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-480-6"></span>21:43 Even in translation the remarkable balance and elusive symmetry of these verses is apparent. The resonances are clear but not complete or mechanical. The first verse combines space (or place; "all the land") with time ("their fathers"). It combines divine action ("the Lord gave") with human action in response ("they took possession . . . they settled").

<span id="page-480-10"></span><span id="page-480-8"></span><span id="page-480-1"></span>21:44 The inclusive "every" of English translation does not have a direct counterpart in the Hebrew but is implied in the idiom "to bring rest" (Hb. *nuakh*) plus "on every side," which is used several times with reference to enemies and implying the condition for some activity given the absence of hostility (cf. Deut. 12:10; 25:19; 2 Sam. 7:1; 1 Chron. 22:9). As in the previous verse, this is recorded as the fidelity of a promise of God spoken to previous generations. Also as in the previous verse, the divine decree has its corresponding human response, this time in the impotence of Israel's enemies to stand against them.

<span id="page-480-9"></span><span id="page-480-7"></span>21:45 The two particular promises of Josh 21:43–44 concerning land and victory are now expanded to include every word spoken by the Lord on Israel's behalf. In the distinctive diction of Deuteronomy the case is stated both negatively and positively as the narrator strains to convey the comprehensive character of God's gift and its reception.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-480-5"></span>The conclusion of the military campaigns in the first part of the book finished with a summary statement of the taking of the land promised by God and the arrival of rest (Josh. 11:22–23). There the focus fell on Joshua as the leader of God's people through the territorial wars against aggressive kings. Here, by contrast, in the summary concluding the book's second section the emphasis falls entirely on God's fidelity as that which enabled Israel's success.

<span id="page-480-4"></span><span id="page-480-3"></span><span id="page-480-2"></span><span id="page-480-0"></span>The text bears echoes back to the beginning of the book, particularly to the words of the Transjordan tribes to Joshua regarding their commitment to accompany their brothers into the land west of the Jordan; this is seen especially in 21:44 and the provision of "rest" (cf. 1:13–15). But the arc of this summary goes far beyond that. Twice it identifies the recipients of these promises of God as "their fathers." Clearly in context this refers to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (cf. Ex. 4:5) and again makes a connection to the language that began the book (cf. Josh. 1:6; 5:6). This reach back into the patriarchal promises is deeply significant. The books of Moses come to an end in Deuteronomy 34 with those promises still unfulfilled: Israel remains outside the land on the plains of Moab, poised and prepared to progress, yet outside the Land of Promise all the same. Here, as the two phases of settlement—identified with Gilgal and Shiloh—have been completed and provision of cities for refuge and Levi has been made, that promise now stands fulfilled.

This emphatic and inclusive statement of the fulfillment of God's promise rings with clarity, which is its primary purpose. However, there may be a subtle message between the lines. The overt and definitive statement of God's comprehensive faithfulness to his good promises to Israel throws into relief the partial, flawed, and incomplete nature of Israel's settlement noted at various points as the territorial inheritance has taken place. The dominant surface message of these verses has often been superficially juxtaposed by some with the more pessimistic trajectory of the book of Judges, as if these books told two contradictory, or at least incompatible, stories. But it is not so, as the final chapters of Joshua will further clarify.

### <span id="page-481-3"></span>OVERVIEW OF JOSHUA 22:1–24:33

<span id="page-481-5"></span><span id="page-481-2"></span>The last three chapters of Joshua each depict Joshua as "summoning" (22:1; 23:2) or "gathering" (24:1) either part of Israel (22:1) or the whole of Israel (23:2; 24:1). Each chapter in different ways addresses the theme of living in obedience to God in the Land of Promise. In each of the three chapters speeches figure heavily. Chapter 22 includes more narrative development than the final two chapters, which form a close-knit pair, but all have defined narrative contexts, each of which answers a question relevant to this moment in Israel's history (cf. table 2.6).

<span id="page-481-6"></span><span id="page-481-4"></span><span id="page-481-1"></span>If chapter 22 presents a story of risk and danger to the unity of Israel, with chapters 23–24 being concerned for its fidelity, then the double ending of Joshua (Joshua 22; 23–24) has some resonance with the double ending of Judges (Judges 17–18; 19–21), which likewise has all to do with the failed fidelity and shattered unity of Israel.

### <span id="page-482-0"></span>JOSHUA 22:1–34

22 At that time Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, **<sup>2</sup>** and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you. **3**You have not forsaken your brothers these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the Lord your God. **4**And now the Lord your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them. Therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan. **5**Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul." **<sup>6</sup>** So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.

**7**Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them, **8**he said to them, "Go back to your tents with much wealth and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers." **<sup>9</sup>** So the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the Lord through Moses.

**<sup>10</sup>**And when they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of imposing size. **<sup>11</sup>**And the people of Israel heard it said, "Behold, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel." **12**And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh to make war against them.

**<sup>13</sup>**Then the people of Israel sent to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, **<sup>14</sup>** and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel. **15**And they came to the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them, **<sup>16</sup>** "Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord, 'What is this breach of faith that you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the Lord by building yourselves an altar this day in rebellion against the Lord? **17**Have we not had enough of the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the Lord, **<sup>18</sup>** that you too must turn away this day from following the Lord? And if you too rebel against the Lord today then tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel. **19**But now, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over into the Lord's land where the Lord's tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against the Lord or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God. **20**Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.' "

**<sup>21</sup>**Then the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel, **<sup>22</sup>** "The Mighty One, God, the Lord! The Mighty One, God, the Lord! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the Lord, do not spare us today **<sup>23</sup>** for building an altar to turn away from following the Lord. Or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings on it, may the Lord himself take vengeance. **24**No, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, 'What have you to do with the Lord, the God of Israel? **25**For the Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you people of Reuben and people of Gad. You have no portion in the Lord.' So your children might make our children cease to worship the Lord. **26**Therefore we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, **<sup>27</sup>**but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we do perform the service of the Lord in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, so your children will not say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in the Lord." ' **28**And we thought, 'If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, "Behold, the copy of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you." ' **29**Far be it from us that we should rebel against the Lord and turn away this day from following the Lord by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before his tabernacle!"

**<sup>30</sup>**When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their eyes. **31**And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh, "Today we know that the Lord is in our midst, because you have not committed this breach of faith against the Lord. Now you have delivered the people of Israel from the hand of the Lord."

**<sup>32</sup>**Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the people of Reuben and the people of Gad in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them. **33**And the report was good in the eyes of the people of Israel. And the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and the people of Gad were settled. **34**The people of Reuben and the people of Gad called the altar Witness, "For," they said, "it is a witness between us that the Lord is God."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-484-1"></span>Over chapters 13–21 the land has been apportioned between the twelve inheriting tribes, and the non-inheriting tribe of Levi has been provided with cities from each of the other tribes for its dwelling, including the cities of refuge. Israel as a whole can now begin to enjoy a settled life in the Land of Promise. It is both ominous and alarming, then, that the first narrative after settlement is one that is fraught with danger and flirts with apostasy.

<span id="page-484-14"></span><span id="page-484-5"></span><span id="page-484-4"></span><span id="page-484-3"></span><span id="page-484-2"></span><span id="page-484-0"></span>Now that Israel has "rest on every side" (21:44), the time has come for the Transjordan tribes to return to the homeland granted them by the Lord through Moses (cf. 1:12–15; cf. also comments there). The formal discharge from service at Joshua's initiative is narrated in the opening section of the chapter (21:1–8). Having gathered the warriors of these two and a half tribes (v. 1), Joshua reviews the arrangements (vv. 2–3) and acknowledges the fulfillment of the conditions of their settlement to the east of the Jordan (v. 4), adding an exhortation to faithful obedience on their return (v. 5). He blesses them, and they disperse (v. 6). Verses 7–8 provide the further observation that Manasseh is the tribe of two halves, distributed on either side of the Jordan (v. 7), and also instruct the returning warriors to divide their share of the spoil among those who remained in their districts during the military campaigns (v. 8).

<span id="page-484-9"></span><span id="page-484-8"></span><span id="page-484-7"></span><span id="page-484-6"></span>Verse 9 narrates the return of the warriors of these tribes and serves as something of a transition. In some structural arrangements this appears as a conclusion to the dispersal scene of verses 1–8. However, given both the ancient paragraph marker at the end of verse 8 (Hb. *petukhah*), which places the division at this point, and the narrative impetus that verse 9 initiates in the following events, it seems best to include verse 9 as the first, introductory element of the longer narrative sequel rather than as the conclusion to Joshua's dispersal of the Transjordan tribes in verses 1–8.

<span id="page-484-11"></span><span id="page-484-10"></span>That narrative unfolds in five movements. Following the return of the Transjordan warriors to their homes, news reaches Israel that a massive altar has been constructed east of the Jordan; the people assemble to prepare for war (vv. 9– 12). Alarmed, a delegation headed by Phinehas is dispatched to investigate, warn, and castigate their brothers (vv. 13–20). The defensive speech in response by the two and a half tribes, the longest portion of the narrative, asserts their fear of being cut off from Israel and also their commitment to faithful, obedient worship of the Lord (vv. 21–29). Satisfied, Phinehas and his delegation reassure the Transjordan tribes (vv. 30–31) and return and report to Israel, with war averted (vv. 32–33).

<span id="page-485-4"></span>A variety of chiastic structures have been suggested for the narrative of the altar dispute in 22:9–34, some more fine grained than others. The account does appear to display at least an overall symmetry:

- <span id="page-485-5"></span><span id="page-485-3"></span>(A) Return [Transjordan tribes] + Altar Built + Israel: War Proposed (22:9–12)
	- (B) Phinehas and Delegation: Accuse and Warn (22:13–20)
		- (C) Transjordan Tribes Confession and Defense (22:21–29)
	- (B') Phinehas and Delegation: Acquit and Affirm (22:30–31)
- <span id="page-485-13"></span><span id="page-485-12"></span>(A') Return [Delegation] + Israel: War Averted + Altar Named (22:32–34)

It is also possible to discern a similar chiastic arrangement to the long speech of the Transjordan tribes. A number of elements are repeated through the speech, but the following form emerges:

<span id="page-485-6"></span>Confession! (22:22a)

- <span id="page-485-8"></span><span id="page-485-7"></span>(A) Altar Built neither in Rebellion nor for Sacrifice (22:22b–23)
	- (B) Motivation: Fear of Division between Descendants (22:24–25)
		- (C) Altar Built for Witness, Sign of Fidelity, Maintain Unity (22:26–27)
	- (B') Motivation: Averting Division between Descendants (22:28)
- <span id="page-485-11"></span><span id="page-485-10"></span><span id="page-485-9"></span>(A') Altar Not Built in Rebellion; Only One Altar for Sacrifice (22:29)

If these chiastic structures have some merit, then the speech of the Transjordan tribes is nested in the center of the overall chiasm, with its own center being the full statement of the purpose of this altar, which is to prevent the disinheritance of the tribes east of the Jordan from the rest of Israel and thus to safeguard the nation's unity.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-485-2"></span><span id="page-485-1"></span><span id="page-485-0"></span>22:1–6 The discharge of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh from accompanying the rest of Israel during the conquest of the land west of the Jordan has clear echoes back to the beginning of the book. In 1:12–15 these tribes were reminded of their obligation to honor the command of Moses given to this group on the granting of their inheritance east of the Jordan. When "rest" had come through God to Israel (1:15), they could then return to their "rest" (1:13). Joshua's speech here overlaps significantly with that previous address to these tribes, now

<span id="page-486-8"></span><span id="page-486-7"></span><span id="page-486-5"></span>in recognition of their faithful service (22:2–3). After the formal discharge itself (v. 4) the roles that Joshua and the Transjordan tribes adopted in the prologue to the book are reversed. There, the accompanying tribes affirmed their willing obedience to the word of Moses, to Joshua, and to the Lord (1:16–18). Now, with the job done, it is Joshua's turn to admonish them, speaking of obedience to the law out of love for their God in language strongly resonant with that of Deuteronomy. Yet with the piling up distinctive phrases, no one exemplar from Deuteronomy serves as an original. Probably Deuteronomy 10:12–13 contains the strongest concentration, but several other passages also align markedly with the phrases of Joshua 22:5.127 This is an emphatic call to wholehearted fidelity.

<span id="page-486-18"></span><span id="page-486-9"></span><span id="page-486-6"></span><span id="page-486-1"></span>It remains only for Joshua to add his blessing and send them home, just as he did for his old comrade, Caleb, in 14:13. The same actions of blessing, sending, and going to "their tents" come together again only in 1 Kings 8:66 in the aftermath of the prayer of dedication of the temple, as Solomon sends the people home and that is immediately followed in 1 Kings 9 by a word of warning to the king concerning the dangers of disobedience and serving other gods.

<span id="page-486-19"></span><span id="page-486-11"></span><span id="page-486-10"></span>22:7–8 The narrator's notice in Joshua 22:7 that Manasseh is the one tribe divided into two by the Jordan seems odd here. This very literary oddity, however, gives pause, and its observation perhaps hints at the tensions soon to arise. In any case, Joshua now instructs the warriors to "go back" (a form of the Hb. verb *shub*; v. 8) and share the spoil with those who remained in the Transjordan during the military campaign ("your wives, your little ones, and your livestock"; 1:14), following the principle laid down in Numbers 31:25–27. Having delivered these instructions, Joshua's voice fades, and so does he from this narrative. He will be neither seen nor heard from again until chapter 23.

<span id="page-486-17"></span><span id="page-486-12"></span><span id="page-486-4"></span><span id="page-486-0"></span>The verb for "go back" (*shub*) which can mean "turn" or "return" (or even "repent," although it does not bear that nuance in this chapter), runs like a thread through this chapter. It is used in this form seven times (22:8, 9, 16, 18 [in the speech of the delegation], 23, 29 [in the speech of the Transjordan tribes], 32 [as the delegation returns "to the land of Canaan"]).

<span id="page-486-16"></span><span id="page-486-14"></span><span id="page-486-13"></span>22:9–12 In a moment it all seems to be undone. The men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh leave Shiloh and return—the verb *shub* is the first word of verse 9 in Hebrew—to their land. En route ("in the land of Canaan") they build "an altar of imposing size" (v. 10). The Hebrew here is "a large altar for seeing" (Hb. *mizbeah gadol lemarʾeh*), stressing not so much its size as its visibility—thus the rendering of a number of English versions as "conspicuous" (EHV, TLV). News comes back to the rest of Israel (v. 11), and a council of war convenes at Shiloh (v. 12).

<span id="page-486-15"></span>With dizzying speed all the benefits of the toil, trial, and trauma that have preceded in the book to bring Israel to this point seem about to be undone. So

<span id="page-486-3"></span><span id="page-486-2"></span><sup>127</sup> Cf. Elie Assis, "'For It Shall Be a Witness between Us': A Literary Reading of Josh 22," *SJOT* 18/2 (2004): 211–212. Assis lists in addition Deuteronomy 11:22; 19:9; 30:20. To these should be added Deuteronomy 13:4–5, which employs these phrases as a warning against apostasy.

<span id="page-487-10"></span><span id="page-487-9"></span><span id="page-487-5"></span><span id="page-487-2"></span><span id="page-487-1"></span><span id="page-487-0"></span>swift and natural is the revulsion shared between Israel and later readers of Joshua toward this altar that seldom is the question asked of why it is built in the first place. Joshua himself had led a covenant ceremony at an altar built on Mount Ebal, the construction of which is narrated with some care (8:30–31; cf. comment on 8:30–32, 34–35a). Abraham (Gen. 12:7–8; 13:18; 22:9), Isaac (Gen. 26:25), and Jacob (33:20; 35:7) were all altar builders. After Joshua's time, Gideon built an altar (Judg. 6:24), and Manoah's "rock" (*tsur*) is called an "altar" (Judg. 13:19–20). Modern commentators are typically more interested in identifying the altar's location (impossible) while neglecting to ask why it was a problem in the first place. Calvin at least addresses the question: his indignation at the audacity of the altar is palpable ("the work might be deemed vicious," "detest its sacrilegious audacity," etc.), but he offers Exodus 20:24 as the law's "strict prohibition" against two altars, although this is not the original concern of that legislation.128 Keil comes closer in suggesting the same issue but from a different text: the regulations concerning centralization of worship in Deuteronomy 12:4—although the restriction to a single altar is not explicit here, either.129 The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi explained the reaction of Joshua 22:12 by asserting, "High places were prohibited once the tabernacle was established at Shiloh." The new status of Shiloh (cf. comment on 18:1) provides the key. Deuteronomy 12 indeed informs the explanation, but more likely in verses 13–14, which warn, "Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place that you see, but at the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings." Rashi's identification of Shiloh as initiating this restriction clarifies the logic.

<span id="page-487-8"></span><span id="page-487-7"></span><span id="page-487-6"></span><span id="page-487-4"></span><span id="page-487-3"></span>The narrator stresses the rapidly rising tension via an unusual reiteration of names through these verses. "The people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh" are explicitly identified fully three times in Joshua 22:9, 10, 11. Three times the "people of Israel" (Hb. *bene yisraʾel*) are named in verses 11, 12 (2x in this short verse). The protagonists are thus held firmly before the reader's eyes.

Not only are the names of these potentially warring factions repeated but so too are the features of the landscape patiently, even insistently, detailed. In verse 9 the departing warriors go to the "land of Gilead, their own land." Their altarbuilding activity takes place in the "region of the Jordan . . . by the Jordan" (v. 10), reported in verse 11 as the "region about the Jordan." The river as boundary line thus becomes a liminal zone between the estranged tribes. The identity of Israel's land as the "land of Canaan" is a striking designation used three times in verses 9, 10, and 11—like the names of the protagonists. The first occurrence of these uses appears as a gloss to the location of Shiloh (v. 9), the place from which, we now learn, the discharge of the Transjordan tribes has taken place. And as they left from Shiloh, so too in verse 12 the rest of Israel gathers to "make war against them" in Shiloh, bracketing these few verses.

<span id="page-488-18"></span><span id="page-488-16"></span>This is the last time Shiloh is named in Joshua; the site where Israel meets for its final gathering is Shechem (24:1). The next time Shiloh ("where I made my name dwell at first"; Jer. 7:12) is encountered will be in a prelude to civil war (Judg. 18:31).

<span id="page-488-17"></span><span id="page-488-10"></span><span id="page-488-8"></span><span id="page-488-7"></span><span id="page-488-6"></span><span id="page-488-0"></span>22:13–14 Rather than immediately dispatching an army, however, the council sends a delegation comprising ten tribal leaders—in other words, one from each of the "nine and one-half tribes" (Josh. 14:2), with the western half of Manasseh (22:7) included as one of the ten—headed by Phinehas, from the tribe of Levi. It might seem odd that neither Joshua nor Eleazar is involved, as these two together have provided leadership in Israel up to this point (14:1; 17:4; 19:51; 21:1). But Phinehas is an appropriate figure for a mission such as this. A son of Eleazar (and so grandson of Aaron; Ex. 6:25), he came to prominence in his swift, violent, and decisive action stemming from the plague of God's judgment at Peor (Num. 25:1–13). This won for him and his descendants a "perpetual priesthood" (Num. 25:13). He previously acted in a leadership capacity in the campaign against Midian (Num. 31:6), and so he has proven not only his zeal for the Lord, vital in this moment of apparent communal infidelity, but also his capacity to provide a priestly focal point for the army of Israel.

<span id="page-488-12"></span><span id="page-488-11"></span><span id="page-488-9"></span><span id="page-488-5"></span><span id="page-488-4"></span><span id="page-488-2"></span>22:15–20 The site of the delegation's meeting with the Transjordan tribes is not reported, but the implication of the narrative is that it takes place wherever the disputed altar was built. No details are provided of the encounter apart from the speeches made by both parties. The delegation from Israel of the "land of Canaan" (Josh. 22:9) speaks first, making its accusation with warrants in verses 16–20. On behalf of the "whole congregation of the Lord" they level the blunt charge of apostasy (v. 16) rooted in rebellion against Yahweh, the Hebrew *marad* being used four times in these few verses (vv. 16, 18, 19 [2x]). Rather than threatening war, however, the appeal of verse 19 is for these tribes to relocate to "the Lord's land where the Lord's tabernacle stands," west of the Jordan. This entreaty seems to be based on the assumption that the altar building is a perverted attempt by the Transjordan tribes to sanctify their land.

<span id="page-488-15"></span><span id="page-488-14"></span><span id="page-488-13"></span><span id="page-488-3"></span>This imploring invitation from the delegation for the altar builders to reconsider their actions and their inheritance, under threat of divine judgment on disobedience, is bracketed by two precedents: (1) the incident of apostasy involving Baal of Peor and its destructive outcome, with which Phinehas is so deeply associated (vv. 17–18; cf. Num. 25:1–18), and (2) the more recent disobedience of Achan, for which in God's "wrath" (*qetsef*) "he did not perish alone [*ʾish ʾehad*]" (v. 20). For the latter case it has been observed that the wording here suggests an association with Numbers 16:22.130 That verse records the response of Moses and Aaron to God's threat to consume the whole "congregation" in the rebellion of Korah: "And they fell on their faces and said, 'O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall

<span id="page-488-1"></span><sup>130</sup> A. Graeme Auld, "Pluralism Where Least Expected? Joshua 22 in Biblical Context," *ExpTim* 122/8 (2011): 376–377.

one man [*ʾish ʾehad*] sin, and will you be angry [*tiqtsof*] with all the congregation?'" These are the only places in the Hebrew Bible in which the anger of God and the seemingly innocuous phrase "one man" come together. The intertextual association further deepens the gravity of the situation as perceived by the delegation: the very survival of the nation is at stake.

<span id="page-489-5"></span><span id="page-489-4"></span><span id="page-489-3"></span><span id="page-489-2"></span>22:21–29 The Transjordan tribes immediately repudiate the charge of rebellious behavior (Hb. *marad*, Josh. 22:22, 29; cf. comment on 22:15–20). They begin with a threefold confession of the God of Israel, emphatically declared twice (v. 22). They vehemently deny any intent to use the altar for sacrifice of any kind (v. 23) but claim that its construction arose out of fear of rejection by the descendants of those living across the Jordan, since they have been divided from the rest of the nation by divine will (vv. 24–25). With that premise, verses 26–27 spell out their intentions for this altar: it will not provide a place of sacrifice but rather will stand as witness that their offerings are devoted to the Lord. Verse 28 explains once more that this altar will prevent estrangement between their descendants; the speech concludes in verse 29 with a reiteration of their repudiation of rebellion and an affirmation that the Lord's one altar is located at the tabernacle.

<span id="page-489-15"></span><span id="page-489-14"></span><span id="page-489-7"></span>The insistent, repetitive rhetoric of this reply bespeaks the urgency with which it is delivered. Like the speech of the delegation, it too contains intertextual elements undergirding its argument; unlike such elements in the previous speech, these are not explicitly signaled. The combination of the three divine names confessed as they begin (v. 22) is found again only at Psalm 50:1, which invokes this God as he who "summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting" (thus from east to west). He then calls his covenant people together, informing them that he has no need of their sacrifice (Ps. 50:5–15). This resonates strongly with the concerns here of the Transjordan tribes. As they go on (Josh. 22:22), a second phrase evokes another psalm, this time Psalm 44. "He knows" in this grammatical form used of divine knowledge is found only here and at Psalm 44:21, part of a protest of innocence that asserts God knows the "secrets of the heart."131 At least for attentive readers, these intertextual echoes reinforce the Transjordan tribes' claim of innocence.

<span id="page-489-13"></span><span id="page-489-12"></span><span id="page-489-10"></span><span id="page-489-6"></span>An unusual feature emerges in the hypothetical speech of the future Israelites in Joshua 22:25: Reuben and Gad are named; Manasseh is missing. This pattern continues in verses 32, 33, and 34, while the expected trio of names returns in verses 30–31, the response of the delegation. Here again the divided existence of Manasseh first signaled in verse 7 seems to play a role.

<span id="page-489-9"></span><span id="page-489-8"></span><span id="page-489-1"></span>22:30–31 The delegation under Phinehas hears this speech with approval. Even its brief reply of verse 31 has allusive overtones, but suggestive of very different claims. "The Lord is in our midst" is an assertion of God's holy presence, its closest comparison being found in Exodus 29:45–46, the culmination of the ordination

<span id="page-489-11"></span><span id="page-489-0"></span><sup>131</sup> Cf. ibid., 377–378. On "he knows" cf. also Job 28:23–24 (using a different form of the Hebrew verb), which affirms that God alone knows "everything under the heavens."

<span id="page-490-3"></span><span id="page-490-0"></span>of the priests and the meeting of God and people through sacrifice. There is only one other place that the phrasing Phinehas uses here is found: Numbers 16:3, in the context of the rebellion of Korah already alluded to in this passage (Josh. 22:20). But in Numbers this phrasing is used by the rebel party, a combination of representatives from the tribes of Levi and Reuben, in asserting their parity with Moses and Aaron. This, then, is a more ambiguous datum. Here at any rate it spells an end to divine judgment, not its inception.

<span id="page-490-6"></span><span id="page-490-4"></span>22:32–34 The delegation returns "to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel," satisfied that God's honor is intact and Israel's fidelity is sound. The altar's purpose as explained by the Transjordan tribes in verse 27 ("to be a witness between us and you") becomes the name by which it is known.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-490-2"></span>Two intertwined themes dominate Joshua 22: the nature of unity and the importance of fidelity. The history of a perceived threat to national unity because of one faction's supposed infidelity is often regarded positively by commentators, since at its conclusion national unity is affirmed and true worship upheld. Others see it as a moment of tension that comes to nothing. The threat was illusory, the infidelity never more than hypothetical in the minds of the accusers. Even so, it remains a salutary lesson, as the episode demonstrates that "staying" as Israel might be as fraught as "joining" Israel—cf. Rahab, the Gibeonites—especially as their negative counterpart, Achan, is explicitly identified (v. 20) to illustrate the potential gravity of the situation. But all that evaporates with the discovery by the delegation (led by Phinehas, no less) that it was all just a mistake. As the story concludes, all parties are satisfied not only that their present moment can be peaceful but that their future together before God is assured.

<span id="page-490-7"></span><span id="page-490-5"></span><span id="page-490-1"></span>Yet cause for concern persists. A nonsacrificial altar is the oddest of memorials to leave for future generations to remember their solidarity before their God. The very concept of such an altar seems to be a fundamental oxymoron, like a book intended not to be read, a knife not for cutting, or a gun not for shooting. At one level, analogies to this mute witness in stone have been encountered before in the book; the memorial stones put in place as part of the crossing of the Jordan in chapters 3–4 are the best example, although it was also seen how those stones bearing a message for future generations had a grisly counterpart in the stone cairns erected over the corpses of Israel's enemies. Still, the memorial stones by the Jordan seem a much safer symbol than a large and attractive altar also by the Jordan! The ambiguity of the final intertextual resonance in the passage (cf. comment on 22:30–31) likewise hints at some foreboding. Shiloh's legitimacy and centrality as the one place the Lord has chosen to receive his people's sacrificial offerings is affirmed—but soon Shiloh will be destroyed (cf. Ps. 78:58–61). Yes, Phinehas takes a lead—but is his judgment slipping, as Joshua's did at least once? At the next, and last, time we catch a glimpse of Phinehas he is again in the thick of <span id="page-491-2"></span>violence, only on that occasion it is full-blown civil war, thirty thousand Israelites having been killed on the two previous days by Benjaminites (Judg. 20:28). By then things have clearly gone very wrong.

There are lessons here for God's people who find their unity under threat. The history of the Christian church is littered with fractures and fragmented communities that attest to the continuing need of learning such lessons, wherever they might be found. The lesson here is not that preserving unity promotes a generous plurality. The deadliest enemy, as this passage rightly conveys, is not the Canaanites but rather the Israelites' own propensity to idolatry. When community difference takes this character, what is at stake is not simply the "unity" of God's people but rather their joint focus of attention on God.132 Whatever imperils that attentive relationship is deadly, and the alarm of Israel over the rogue altar is well founded. We can be grateful that a latter-day Phinehas does not carry a literal spear—and that there was one who was pierced by the spear, else we would all deserve to be at the sharp end of business with Phinehas. More important than the relationship of Israel's tribal groupings with each other is their common standing before God.

<span id="page-491-0"></span>That would appear to be settled by the end of this chapter. But the anxiety over the nature of this memorial in stone and the hints the narrator leaves that things could be better imply a warning for the careful listener and reader and prepare for the explicit warnings that will come from Joshua himself in chapters 23–24 in his final two speeches of the book. But it is not just the last two chapters that sound warnings; this chapter certainly does as well.

### <span id="page-491-1"></span>JOSHUA 23:1–16

23 A long time afterward, when the Lord had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years, **<sup>2</sup>** Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders and heads, its judges and officers, and said to them, "I am now old and well advanced in years. **3**And you have seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the Lord your God who has fought for you. **4**Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west. **5**The Lord your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, just as the Lord your God promised you. **<sup>6</sup>**Therefore, be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left, **<sup>7</sup>** that you may not mix with these nations remaining among

you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them, **8**but you shall cling to the Lord your God just as you have done to this day. **9**For the Lord has driven out before you great and strong nations. And as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day. **10**One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the Lord your God who fights for you, just as he promised you. **11**Be very careful, therefore, to love the Lord your God. **12**For if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you and make marriages with them, so that you associate with them and they with you, **13**know for certain that the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you, but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground that the Lord your God has given you.

**<sup>14</sup>** "And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things*<sup>1</sup>* that the Lord your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed. **15**But just as all the good things that the Lord your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the Lord will bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the Lord your God has given you, **<sup>16</sup>** if you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that he has given to you."

#### *Section Overview*

As the end of the book draws nearer, connections to its beginning also loom. This speech of Joshua has clear links back to the first chapter of the book, as the words addressed by God to Joshua there come to be used by Joshua here as he speaks now to the nation.

Commentaries typically bemoan the resistance of this passage to structural analysis and suggest a welter of outlines to capture its flow. The text displays a strong compositional unity and a pronounced overall sense of progression, but at a finer level similar concerns and themes recur throughout, inhibiting discernment of a clear structure. The analysis here is based on two interlocking patterns. At a macro level Joshua's speech can be seen to fall into two large parts, with verses 2–10 predominantly offering positive exhortations based on past observations and verses 11–16 predominantly offering negative warnings based on future possibilities.

<span id="page-492-5"></span><span id="page-492-4"></span><span id="page-492-3"></span><span id="page-492-2"></span><span id="page-492-1"></span><span id="page-492-0"></span>At the same time a sequence of three situations and responses can also be discerned, which would divide the speech slightly differently. The first situation looks back at what the Lord and Joshua have done (vv. 2b–5), giving rise to the corresponding encouragements (vv. 6–8). The second situation describes what God and the people themselves have done (vv. 9–10), with the corollary of being devoted to the true God (vv. 11–13). The final situation is Joshua's own imminent demise and

<span id="page-493-10"></span><span id="page-493-9"></span>God's proven faithfulness (v. 14), which works out in a warning that abandoning God's covenant will equally surely bring his destructive response (vv. 15–16). It is this second pattern that informs the analytical outline below.

Either way the speech has a strong coherence, framed by the opening celebration of Israel's inhabiting the Land of Promise through God's fidelity and the concluding prospect of their enjoyment of that land being taken from them should they prove unfaithful.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-493-7"></span><span id="page-493-2"></span>23:1–2a The narrator of the book of Joshua does not, on the whole, devote much effort to indicating chronology. In the opening chapters the precise details of "three days" (e.g., 1:11; 2:16) proved problematic, but beyond that there are few, if any, fixed time references. The same is true here, although the text's phrasing combines with earlier notices (13:1; 18:3) to impress the reader with the passage of time since the seemingly rapid campaigns of chapters 2–11.

<span id="page-493-6"></span><span id="page-493-3"></span>The whole nation is summoned, although to what location is not specified one assumes Shiloh, but this is only a guess, for this is a "long time afterward," and presumably Joshua himself is well settled at Timnath-serah, not very far from Shiloh. The speech that follows is addressed especially to the leadership of Israel, identified with four titles in two categories, the civil ("elders and heads") and the administrative ("judges and officers"). The last title named provides some closure back to the beginning of the book, as the "officers" were the group responsible for implementing Joshua's orders as the move across the Jordan took place (1:10; 3:2). The full array of titles is used again in the Bible only at 24:1, further linking these two chapters together, although three of these titles (without "heads") are also found for the earlier covenant ceremony on Mount Ebal (8:33).

<span id="page-493-8"></span><span id="page-493-5"></span><span id="page-493-4"></span><span id="page-493-1"></span><span id="page-493-0"></span>23:2b–5 As Joshua's speech begins, it bears a striking resemblance to the first speech in the book, of God to Joshua (1:2–9). Both reiterate the narrative situation, mention the gift of the land, circumscribe briefly its boundaries, and provide assurance of God's capacity to act on Israel's behalf. The element absent here found in the speech

Joshua 23:1–16 494

<span id="page-494-12"></span><span id="page-494-4"></span>of chapter 1—the necessity of obedience to God's word—is what Joshua will go on to require by way of response in 23:6–8. Clearly there is some intention to align Joshua's address to the nation here with God's words to Joshua as the book began.

<span id="page-494-9"></span><span id="page-494-8"></span><span id="page-494-7"></span><span id="page-494-6"></span>Another kind of intertextual link is forged in verse 3 with the reminder that "it is the Lord your God who has fought for you." These are the words used to such striking effect in 10:14, 42, which marked the first of the territorial wars into which Israel was drawn, initially by the Canaanite reaction to the covenant with the Gibeonites and then in the aftermath of the ensuing battle. The phrase will be used again in 23:10, thus framing the first half of the speech (cf. Section Overview of 23:1–16). These two occurrences align with the two occurrences in chapter 10, with two in Exodus 14:14, 25 (at the Red Sea crossing in relation to the pursuing Egyptians), and with two in Deuteronomy 1:30; 3:22 (in which Moses anticipates God's actions across the Jordan). These references combine to weave together the entire exodus story. Such parallels between the entry into the land with the exodus from Egypt were in greater supply in the first part of the book, but continue here. Joshua's speech in chapter 24 will go beyond allusion to direct narration.

<span id="page-494-17"></span><span id="page-494-10"></span><span id="page-494-2"></span><span id="page-494-1"></span>Joshua 23:5 signals that, even though a resting place has been achieved, it is not all over yet. Some future struggles are anticipated, as they are again in the latter part of this chapter (v. 13).

<span id="page-494-15"></span>23:6–8 To the observations that God has dislodged the nations on Israel's behalf and that Joshua has allotted the land, the response called for is one of obedience to God's word as made known through the law of Moses. If the parallels between the first verses of Joshua's speech and God's words to Joshua in chapter 1 were thematic and structural, as Joshua now spells out the response invited in light of these things, the connection between the two speeches deepens to verbal overlaps, especially between 1:7 and 23:6–7 (cf. table 2.7).

| 1:7                                              | 23:6–7                                       |

*Note:* Words in bold indicate shared text.

<span id="page-494-16"></span><span id="page-494-14"></span><span id="page-494-13"></span><span id="page-494-5"></span><span id="page-494-3"></span>The "Book of the Law" mentioned in 23:6 is likewise named in 1:8. Such generosity and faithfulness on God's part calls for complete devotion from Israel, in negative terms by not naming, serving, or bowing down to foreign gods—the latter two also being cited as incurring God's wrath in 23:16, again providing some correspondence between the two halves of this speech (v. 7). Positively, such a rejection of false gods implies or even requires a "clinging" to the true God (v. 8), which is one of the distinctive exhortations of Moses to this same generation of Israelites in Deuteronomy (10:20; 11:22; 13:4 [Hb. v. 5]; 30:20).

<span id="page-495-9"></span><span id="page-495-7"></span><span id="page-495-1"></span>23:9–10 The first premise in Joshua 23:2b–5 combined divine action with Joshua; this second premise associates divine action with Israel. God has dispossessed the nations, but Israel has proved unstoppable "since it is the Lord your God who fights for you." Here Joshua's terms are rooted in the covenant promise of Leviticus 26:8: "Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand." However, the wording here is even closer to that of the Song of Moses (Deut. 32:30), which uses this same language to describe Israel's being handed over by God to their enemies for abandoning him:

<span id="page-495-4"></span> How could one have chased a thousand, and two have put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had given them up?

Perhaps there is an irony here, then, in Joshua's positive statement drawing on the covenant blessings that still manages to recall the negative image of the Song of Moses. The scenario envisaged in the song is the very one that Joshua's exhortation is intended to prevent.

<span id="page-495-12"></span><span id="page-495-10"></span><span id="page-495-8"></span><span id="page-495-3"></span><span id="page-495-2"></span>23:11–13 So the second response calls on Israel to "love the Lord your God." The exhortations to "cling" (v. 8) in the first response and "love" here distribute the parts combined by Moses in Deuteronomy 11:22, associated with driving out the nations, and Deuteronomy 30:19–20, in which Moses urges Israel to "choose life," as Joshua will go on to do in Joshua 24. Failure to do so will result in God's "no longer driving out these nations before you," with dire consequences, graphically described. Tragically, the outcome that Joshua's warning is designed to preclude is exactly what Israel experiences through their disobedience in Judges 2:3. If Joshua's words had any effect, it did not last very long (cf. Josh. 24:31).

<span id="page-495-14"></span><span id="page-495-13"></span><span id="page-495-11"></span><span id="page-495-6"></span><span id="page-495-5"></span>23:14 Joshua's mortality is again in view as yet another element in the speech forges a connection with a significant earlier moment in the book. The conclusion to the settlement account occupying chapters 13–21 made an emphatic statement of the complete faithfulness of God to his promises to Israel (21:43–45). The end of that conclusion is woven here into Joshua's final situation demanding a response (cf. table 2.8).

| 21:45                                                                                                                   | 23:14                                                                                                                                                                     |

<span id="page-495-0"></span>TABLE 2.8: Overlap between Joshua 21:45 and 23:14

*Note*: Words in bold signal shared text; words set in italics show corresponding elements that differ owing to context.

There are only minor differences between the two verses, their wording being even closer in Hebrew than is apparent in translation. Just as the beginning of Israel's venture under God to return to the Land of Promise is linked in the beginning of the speech, so too is their endpoint of enjoying settled life in the land connected to the end of that process.

<span id="page-496-6"></span><span id="page-496-4"></span><span id="page-496-1"></span>23:15–16 Verse 13 made the shift from past response to future possibility, and the future could be problematic if Israel defaulted on the covenant with Yahweh. This painful and tragic possible future is laid out by Joshua as the conclusion to the speech. He ends not with an optimistic hope but rather with a realistic warning. Israel has demonstrated its capacity for apostasy in too many ways over the long exodus journey, and even through Achan (ch. 7) in its mission of conquest. The inevitability in case of apostasy is that God will "destroy you from off this good land" (23:15). The action here might well be translated "annihilate," reflecting a deliberate obligation to destroy objects or enemies. The thread of this lexeme through Joshua is instructive: aside from 7:12, where it is used with reference to the items of *kherem* taken by Achan, elsewhere it is used of the action of either Yahweh or Israel against the Canaanites (9:24; 11:14, 20; 24:8 [of Amorites across the Jordan]). Here it is applied, at least potentially, against Israelites.

<span id="page-496-7"></span><span id="page-496-5"></span><span id="page-496-3"></span><span id="page-496-2"></span>The possibility that Israel might "go and serve other gods and bow down to them" (v. 16) brings before Israel again this specter first raised in verse 7, although there as a statement of what they should avoid in the life of obedience. Here it is identified as the action that will incur God's wrath. While the speech began by appreciating the blessing of settled life in the Promised Land under God, it ends by warning of the risk of perishing from the land—still under God. Or, in other words, living in such a way that places them in opposition to Yahweh will lead them to be regarded just as the Canaanites were—and to experience the same fate.

#### *Response*

To the modern ear the closing encouragement of the aged Joshua to Israel might not sound very encouraging. But it is most definitely what Israel needs to hear, and it is good for later generations of God's people to hear it too.

The situation-and-response structure to the speech brings two elements into the foreground. The first is the strong emphasis throughout on what God *has* done for Israel. Israel's role seems remarkably passive; even in the recounting of the resounding success of Israel's army it all comes down to the Lord's action on Israel's behalf. The Lord fights and Israel possesses.

<span id="page-496-0"></span>The opening moments and their invocation of God's own words to Joshua in 1:1–9 do more than provide a long narrative arc to bring some closure for a book about to end. Beyond that, as Joshua redirects God's words to him at the beginning of his leadership to the settled nation as his time comes to an end, he is in effect making a nation of "Joshuas": "The careful obedience that was placed upon Joshua as an individual at the start of the book now becomes the duty of the entire people and of their collective leadership."133

Altogether this calls positively for a response of obedience and negatively for a rejection of apostasy. As Joshua frames it, memory undergirds both sides of the demand for devotion, both the clinging to and loving of their covenant God and the spurning and rejecting of any fakes or rivals. The emphasis on what God *has* done, then, sets up what Israel *ought* to do. It seems at a superficial level to be the opposite of what Paul declares in his emotive and evocative letter to the Philippian Christians: "One thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:13–14). Oliver O'Donovan explains Paul's words this way:

<span id="page-497-2"></span>On the face of it Paul is simply opposed to remembering . . . But in fact, of course, Paul never stopped remembering. The whole of this passage, like so much else that he wrote, springs from that infinitely fruitful focus of his memory, the event on the Damascus road. So the question is not whether to remember, but how to. Memory, like every other movement of the mind, has to serve the upward call. It has to prepare us to recognize that moment, not shield us against it. . . . To remember constructively is, in one sense, to disown the past, not in the sense of denying it, but gaining a distance on it, *discounting it*, in Paul's metaphor, against the gain that is offered us on the other horizon. And how do we discount it? By setting it to God's account. That is why we are so often told by the apostles to give thanks. Thankful memory transfers events out of our own field of action into the record of God's deeds for us.134

If O'Donovan is right, then the "how" of memory taught by Paul is of the same quality as that urged by Joshua on Israel and its leaders. All that they enjoy is God's doing; how should they then live? By clinging to, by loving, the God whose every good word to them brought life.

<span id="page-497-1"></span>There is warning in the end. Here too there are Pauline parallels, notably in his warning directed to the Gentile Christians in Rome, and in which the Jewish Christians in Rome were also implicated: "They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you" (Rom. 11:20–21). It is not just Paul. Jesus conveys his message to the churches in Asia through John on Patmos and warns the Ephesians, "I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent" (Rev. 2:5; cf. 2:16; 3:3, 17, 19). Joshua's speech urges God's people to see that contentment as a consequence of triumph is time not for complacency but for deep concern and devoted commitment.

<span id="page-498-0"></span>24Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel. And they presented themselves before God. **2**And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, 'Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates,*<sup>1</sup>* Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods. **3**Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River*<sup>2</sup>* and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac. **4**And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. **5**And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.

**<sup>6</sup>** " 'Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. **7**And when they cried to the Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time. **8**Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. **9**Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you, **10**but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand. **11**And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand. **12**And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow. **<sup>13</sup>** I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.'

**<sup>14</sup>** "Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. **15**And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."

**<sup>16</sup>**Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods, **<sup>17</sup>** for it is the Lord our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed. **18**And the

Lord drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the Lord, for he is our God."

<span id="page-499-1"></span><span id="page-499-0"></span>**<sup>19</sup>**But Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the Lord, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. **<sup>20</sup>** If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm and consume you, after having done you good." **21**And the people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the Lord." **22**Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord, to serve him." And they said, "We are witnesses." **<sup>23</sup>** He said, "Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the Lord, the God of Israel." **<sup>24</sup>**And the people said to Joshua, "The Lord our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey." **<sup>25</sup>** So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and put in place statutes and rules for them at Shechem. **26**And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the Lord. **27**And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the Lord that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God." **<sup>28</sup>** So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.

#### *Section Overview*

The resonances between this chapter and the previous one are immediately apparent even to the casual reader: the national leader summons the people and addresses their leaders, reviewing the benefits they enjoy as a result of God's actions on their behalf, pressing the claims of their God on them for their continued flourishing, and warning them of the dire consequences to follow should their devotion to this God falter or fail. Beyond this superficial level, however, these two final—and clearly complementary—chapters fill that content quite differently. In chapter 23 Joshua speaks in his own voice and without reply in generalized terms concerning what God has done for Israel.

<span id="page-499-4"></span><span id="page-499-3"></span><span id="page-499-2"></span>In chapter 24, by contrast, having gathered the people to Shechem (the setting of chapter 23 is never specified), Joshua takes on the persona of a prophet and delivers an oracle of God. In this Joshua speaks in the first person for the deity as a narrative of divine action on Israel's behalf, details the moments in which God decisively intervened in the life of the nation, and covers the earliest covenant promise to the great patriarch Abraham up to the present moment they enjoy in the landscape of their new homes (24:1–13). Like a preacher, Joshua applies this "text" to his congregation—that is, the whole of Israel—and confronts them with the stark choice with which this oracle leaves them: to serve *this* God or some *others*, as their distant ancestors did before knowing this God (vv. 14–15, alluding to v. 2). Thus far the resonances with chapter 23 are clear, even if filled with different content.

<span id="page-500-11"></span><span id="page-500-9"></span>From this point a remarkable debate breaks out between the people and Joshua. In a dramatic to-and-fro series of claim and counterclaim Israel affirms its willingness and determination to serve this God, while Joshua robustly disputes both their desire and their capacity to carry through on their intention (24:16–24). Joshua finally relents, and the covenant between God and people is confirmed (vv. 25–27) in terms reminiscent both of the previous covenant ceremony on Mount Ebal, overlooking Shechem (8:30–35), and of the more recent resolution to the nonsacrificial altar crisis narrated in chapter 22 (cf. 24:27 with 22:34). With this the people are dismissed to their homes (24:28).

<span id="page-500-13"></span><span id="page-500-12"></span><span id="page-500-10"></span><span id="page-500-4"></span><span id="page-500-3"></span><span id="page-500-1"></span>We find a number of surprising elements in this major concluding episode to the book of Joshua (only the brief biographical notices remain; cf. comments on 24:29–33). Joshua's prophetic voice is unexpected, as is the nature of his resistance to Israel's "choice" (v. 22). There is no whiff here of life lived happily ever after quite the opposite. The dominant theme emerging from the chapter, which will be picked up by way of response, is one of service. The first time the Hebrew verb *ʿabad* ("to serve") is used in Joshua comes as late as 22:5, cropping up again in resolution to the crisis of that chapter in verse 27. It is used twice more in the previous speech of Joshua (23:7, 16). But in this chapter it is used fully fifteen times (24:2, 14 [3x], 15 [4x], 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24), as well as once more in the final biographical notices to record Israel's "serving" the Lord during Joshua's days (24:31). Clearly, then, service is the major concern as the book comes to a close.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-500-7"></span><span id="page-500-2"></span><span id="page-500-0"></span>24:1 Shechem might be thought to be an unusual location for Joshua to gather the tribes of Israel. Shiloh has been established as the cultic center for the nation and has been the scene of the previous national gatherings (18:1; 22:12). However, as noted in the comments on 8:30–35, Shechem, nestled between Mounts Gerizim and Ebal, had long been associated with covenant making (cf. Deut. 11:29),

as well as being the site of a previous such ceremony under Joshua. This is sufficient reason for Joshua to make it the place of summons. That Shechem also lay at the nexus of the ancient road network, unlike Shiloh, gave it that practical advantage as well.

The final clause, that in response to Joshua's summons "they presented themselves before God," distinguishes this assembly from the previous one and sets the stage for the kind of address they are about to receive from Joshua. Joshua may have called them together, but it is before God that they stand.

<span id="page-501-6"></span><span id="page-501-4"></span>24:2a There is some sense of déjà vu as this chapter begins, given its resonances with the previous one. However, the hint that something different is happening here is already signaled at the end of 24:1. As Joshua begins to speak, that sense escalates: not only is Joshua's summons a call to meet with God, but as he begins to speak Israel hears from God. "Thus says the Lord" is typically an introduction to prophetic speech. As Joshua continues to speak, the "I" first-person referent is not Joshua but God. Unlike the more personal word conveyed by Joshua in chapter 23, here it is very much a prophetic word as God speaks to his people through his prophet Joshua.

<span id="page-501-13"></span><span id="page-501-7"></span><span id="page-501-3"></span>24:2b–13 The oracle consists of a God's-eye view of Israel's history, stretching back to the ancient times even before Abraham and bringing the story right up to the present moment. With the character of a historical review, the closest comparator is Ezekiel 20, also an oracular account of Israel's history; in the NT Stephen's speech in Acts 7 has something of this quality as well, although it is very much Stephen speaking, not God.

<span id="page-501-14"></span><span id="page-501-9"></span><span id="page-501-8"></span><span id="page-501-5"></span><span id="page-501-0"></span>The sequence of episodes moves through three phases, with two distinct emphases. The first phase corresponds to the history of Genesis, beginning with Abraham's father, Terah, in Mesopotamia (cf. Gen. 11:27–32), where Abraham's ancestors "served other gods" (Josh. 24:2). Verses 3–4 swiftly narrate the patriarchal generations until the descent of Jacob's sons—the eponymous ancestors of Israel's twelve tribes—to Egypt. The emphasis of this history from Genesis relates especially to the gift of offspring, the flourishing family that became a nation in Egypt. Moses and Aaron serve as the transition from Egypt (v. 5) for the second phase of the story, the travails of Israel in the wilderness (vv. 6–10). This covers the period from the book of Exodus and the departure from Egypt to the stories of Numbers, especially the military engagements with the Amorites (Num. 21:21–35) and the prophetic opposition mounted by Balaam (Numbers 22–24). The final phase covers the events of the book of Joshua itself (Josh. 24:11–13), from the Jordan crossing (Joshua 3–4) to their present settled life. In these latter two phases the emphasis falls on God's "giving" victory (24:8, 11) and the land in which they dwell (v. 13).

<span id="page-501-12"></span><span id="page-501-11"></span><span id="page-501-10"></span><span id="page-501-2"></span><span id="page-501-1"></span>Several distinctive perspectives embedded in this compressed narrative distinguish it from being just a catalog of moments in the relationship between God and people. Starting the story with Terah is unusual, for starters. Outside the brief <span id="page-502-13"></span><span id="page-502-2"></span>passage in Genesis that narrates God's dealings with Terah, he is mentioned again the OT only in the genealogy of 1 Chronicles 1:26. The purpose for starting with Terah here is clear: the Mesopotamian roots of God's people, before the divine promise claimed Abraham and his offspring, finds the ancestors at a point in which "they served other gods" (Josh. 24:2). This observation provides the momentum for Joshua's application of the oracle and the trenchant exchange that follows. The patriarchal phase and its emphasis on the growing number of Abraham's descendants reflects the first element of God's promise to Abraham, "I will make of you a great nation" (Gen. 12:2), but incorporates God's power and authority to grant territory, in this case to Esau (Edom; Josh. 24:4).

<span id="page-502-7"></span><span id="page-502-6"></span><span id="page-502-4"></span><span id="page-502-3"></span><span id="page-502-1"></span><span id="page-502-0"></span>The national story (vv. 6–13) is marked by God's "bringing" (v. 6) Israel out of Egypt into the "land of the Amorites" (v. 8) in a series of situations in which Israel experienced distress and opposition and in which God brought deliverance and blessing to his people. The threats to Israel's life are portrayed consistently as arising from the aggressive and hostile intentions of the enemy. Characterizing the military engagement with Jericho as it appears in verse 11 ("the leaders of Jericho fought against you") would not be the most natural recasting of the episode narrated in chapter 6, for example. In the pattern of distress and deliverance there is a foreshadowing of the cycle that will deepen and deteriorate in the book of Judges. In this narrative the main verbal sequence carrying the action forward is, for the most part, made up of first-person verbs describing God's actions on Israel's behalf. Everything significant that Israel does, addressed here as "you" ("you came," 24:6; "you lived," 24:7; "you took possession," 24:8; "you went over the Jordan and came," 24:11; "you dwell . . . you eat," 24:13), comes about as result of what God has done for them. Without God's taking their part, saving them, fighting for them, and giving to them, Israel would have nothing, be nowhere. Its very existence is thanks to the mighty acts of God on its behalf.

<span id="page-502-9"></span><span id="page-502-8"></span><span id="page-502-5"></span>24:14–15 In true prophetic style, after "thus says the Lord," which provides the motivation, a message follows, now delivered in Joshua's own voice. The very first observation made of the clan touched by the action of God was that "they served other gods" (v. 2). Although rhetorically that starting point seems to have been left behind, the concern it raises now dominates the rest of the proceedings. Joshua presents as a demand the clear obligation arising from what Israel has received from the Lord: to "serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness." Should this be Israel's inclination, then it further follows that they must "put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt." This is startling. The implication is that even at this point those gods are in some measure harbored somewhere in Israel's midst (cf. v. 23; cf. also comment on 24:21–24). It seems their idolatry is more deep-seated than it sometimes appears.

<span id="page-502-12"></span><span id="page-502-11"></span><span id="page-502-10"></span>This is presented as a challenge to Israel (v. 15a), who, if they refuse Yahweh, are offered a choice among foreign gods as their masters (v. 15b). For Joshua it is not a matter of choice. In his stirring and memorable finale to this speech he declares,

<span id="page-503-6"></span>"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (v. 15). At this late point in the book this is the first glimpse we are given of any domestic circle around Israel's great military leader. Unlike Moses, whose family is known (even if not much present in the sprawling exodus narrative), Joshua has no wife, no children—not even siblings. The genealogies of 1 Chronicles, which sometimes provide otherwise unknown details, include Joshua as the termination of a family line (1 Chron. 7:25–27). He appears to be an isolated figure.

<span id="page-503-10"></span>The question hanging in the air regards whether Joshua will likewise be alone in devoting his service to Yahweh. Even in this short application Joshua uses the word "to serve" seven times. There is no missing the point here.

<span id="page-503-8"></span><span id="page-503-7"></span>24:16–18 A truly popular response comes immediately in reply. The answer, like the prophetic speech, is also framed by reference to service of other gods (Josh. 24:16) and serving the true God (24:18). Like Joshua's oracle it is declared by way of memory of the acts of God on the people's behalf, moving with greater speed yet covering the same ground as the Lord's historical recital. It is an Israel's-eye view of that story, acknowledging God's actions on their behalf and concurring wholly with Joshua's assessment.

<span id="page-503-9"></span>24:19–20 Given the fit between Joshua's prophetic challenge and the people's affirmative reply, Joshua's response is astonishing. It is in some measure reminiscent of the resounding no he himself received from the commander of the Lord's army in 5:14.

<span id="page-503-5"></span>This issue resides in the clash of *character* between God and the people: in the first instance the matter turns on who Yahweh is, which is not perhaps what we might expect. Thus one commentator remarks, "It is not so much Israel's weakness or wickedness that makes their aspiration to serve futile, but the inherent nature of the God they have chosen."135 What kind of God is this, then? In short, one unlike the gods of the surrounding nations. The terms in which Joshua depicts this God are not so much drawn from the traditions within this book but rather, like his oracle, stretch further back, in this case to Exodus:

- <span id="page-503-0"></span>(1) Holy: God is identified as such in the Song of Moses. Exodus 15:11 sets Yahweh apart from any rival deity, and so by way of response holiness is required of Israel (Ex. 19:6).
- <span id="page-503-4"></span><span id="page-503-2"></span><span id="page-503-1"></span>(2) Jealous: In the Decalogue this aspect of God's character means that he refuses to be worshiped by idolaters (Ex. 20:5); this is also Yahweh's "name" at Exodus 34:14, in which Moses renews covenant at Sinai after the incident of the golden calf.
- <span id="page-503-3"></span>(3) "Will Not Forgive" (Hb. *yissaʾ*) Their Inevitable "Transgressions" and "Sins": This language finds a close parallel in Exodus 23:21, at which the same warning is given in terms of Israel's rebellion, equated with transgression.

<sup>135</sup> Nelson, *Joshua*, 270.

<span id="page-504-12"></span>Joshua expressly shows why emotional and momentary highs and experiences are not trustworthy: it is far too easy to be self-deceived (1 John 1:8). Joshua's subsequent forecast of Israel's behavior (that they would "forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods") and God's inevitable and necessary response (to "turn . . . harm . . . consume"; Josh. 24:20) concludes his repudiation of the people's declaration for Yahweh and is a striking glimpse of what will happen in Judges as the sequel to this book.

<span id="page-504-7"></span><span id="page-504-6"></span><span id="page-504-5"></span><span id="page-504-2"></span>24:21–24 The people engage in a short, sharp parley, as they reply with a no of their own, also recalling the commander's blunt response of 5:14 and emphatically affirming their prior commitment to serve Yahweh alone, acknowledged by Joshua as their "choice" (24:22). As noted in the overview of this section, this exchange bears echoes of the resolution to the altar crisis of chapter 22, especially in its language of "witness," which bears associations of court testimony and a legal obligation as well. Less overt is the final word in this exchange, which goes to Israel: it will "serve" and "obey" the Lord (24:24). These are precisely the terms that Joshua himself used of Israel as he sent them to their homes on the earlier occasion in 22:2, and they hark back beyond that to the language of Deuteronomy 13:5, another passage centrally concerned with exclusive loyalty to Israel's covenant God.

<span id="page-504-10"></span><span id="page-504-8"></span><span id="page-504-3"></span><span id="page-504-1"></span><span id="page-504-0"></span>24:25–28 Joshua, having relented, now enacts the covenant, recording the terms of the covenant agreement and establishing a memorial in stone as witness, much as with the stones of the Jordan in chapter 4 and the stone called "Witness" (22:28, 34). Much of this is familiar from the previous ceremony on Mount Ebal (8:30–35), with one striking difference: on this occasion there is no sacrifice. Shechem is the place for covenant making, but Shiloh at this moment is the home of the tabernacle, the one place for sacrifice among God's people.

#### *Response*

The deep reach back into the hoary beginnings of this people does more than provide a long narrative arc; it roots them in the time before their great ancestor, Abraham, and also in a place beyond a river more distant than the Jordan, the Euphrates. Their ancestors were "foreign" worshipers of "other" gods—not the true and living God. Running through this chapter is the concern that this may be Israel's default position and that to devote themselves to the service of the Lord will prove nigh unto impossible. Yet the Lord will graciously make a covenant (24:24–25), even with these who are not inherently able to serve him. Within the framework of the book this gives another perspective on the Gibeonite's ploy in chapter 9. Beyond that, however, we see that it will take a new kind of covenant for loyal obedience to take root in the heart of the people and persist in a lasting and stable way (Jer. 31:31–34; Hebrews 8).

<span id="page-504-11"></span><span id="page-504-9"></span><span id="page-504-4"></span>The exhortation to exclusive service, here aimed at those who have recognized and experienced God's work in their lives, is a gospel message. Insofar as Joshua's words anticipate some current idolatrous practice, this is not an unmixed multitude. The analogy may be rough, but the address goes out to both those who are walking obediently and those who are not. However, once recognition comes that God's hand has touched them with blessing, saving, and preserving, the people's only fitting response—recognized by all parties—is to serve that one from whom all blessings flow. The prominence of "serving" vocabulary was noted above. The pre-Christian Greek translator of Joshua had a choice of equivalents for rendering the Hebrew *ʿabad* into Greek. The most frequent translation equivalent is *douleuein*, which is associated with the servitude of a slave. Often, however, *ʿabad* is translated by *latreuein*, as it is on each occasion here. This is used of "work for hire" but, importantly, also of religious service and thus often translated into English as "worship." Compare, for example, the ESV at Hebrews 9:9 ("gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the *worshiper*") with 9:14 ("how much more will the blood of Christ, . . . purify our conscience from dead works *to serve* the living God"), both of which use *latreuein*. This is service as devotion. As Bob Dylan's popular song puts it, "You're gonna have to serve somebody."136 The options displayed to Israel were those who were no gods (cf. Deut. 32:17) or the true and living God; in modern parlance this boils down to the devil or the Lord. This is indeed a gospel message.

<span id="page-505-5"></span><span id="page-505-4"></span><span id="page-505-2"></span><span id="page-505-1"></span><span id="page-505-0"></span>The previous speech of Joshua in chapter 23 gave a prominent place to the operation of memory in forming identity and fueling resolve, and this is the case in chapter 24 as well. Here an account of the past serves as the foundation for the claims in the present, both by Joshua as he speaks prophetically on God's behalf and by the people as they respond willingly to his appeal. Testimony to God's work in the life of his people continues to play a role in fostering faithfulness:

Memory is the urgent business of setting before our eyes God's great act of delivering us from death and giving us a share in his life. Memory, remembering the past, governs our present and our future. . . . How should we act in the present? We should act as those who look back to these mighty acts and, as it were, stand beneath them, acknowledging them as a summons to a distinctive life of obedience to God's grace.137

<span id="page-505-3"></span>Joshua's appeal goes out to God's people in every age to live "a distinctive life of obedience to God's grace," as Webster puts it. Joshua's pointed call to these people whose obedience he had previously commended ("Then put away the foreign gods that are among you"; 24:23) remains a sober reminder of the constant vigilance required if that distinctiveness is not to be sullied by the corrosive power of the lure of false gods.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-506-4"></span><span id="page-506-1"></span><span id="page-506-0"></span>Genesis ends with the death of Joseph (Gen. 50:22–26) following closely the death of Jacob (Genesis 49). Deuteronomy ends with the death of Moses (Deut. 34:1–8). In like manner the notice of Joshua's death concludes this book, along with the observation of the fate of the nation as he and the elders of the generation he led into Canaan pass from the scene (Josh. 24:29–31). This is joined by two further burials, one of which is of Joseph himself, whose remains now at last arrive at a final resting place (v. 32). The final notice is devoted to Eleazar (v. 33), who has been less prominent than Joshua in this book but has played the role of his "Aaron" after succeeding Aaron in the leadership of Israel with Moses at Aaron's death (and in fact serving alongside Moses for some time before that; Num. 3:32; 33:38–39). Given the beginnings of the rise to prominence of Judah, it is remarkable that all three of these great leaders represent the north; Joseph (father of the northern tribes Ephraim and Manasseh) is buried at Shechem, while both Joshua and Eleazar are buried in Ephraimite territory. So leadership at the end is northern, even as the momentum passes to the tribe of Judah, both within chapters 13–19 as well as in the opening chapters of Judges. Perhaps, then, there is some symbolic value to these notices, as leadership dies in the north.

### *Comment*

<span id="page-507-6"></span>24:29–31 Joshua dies at the age of 110—the same as Joseph's age at death, as it happens. The account of Joshua's inheritance completed the lengthy description of the allocation of land; Timnath-serah is found in an area not far from one of the scenes of the most dramatic victories Joshua experienced under the hand of God (cf. comment on 19:49–50).

<span id="page-507-5"></span><span id="page-507-3"></span>The final use of the key word "to serve" in chapter 24 comes in verse 31. It is difficult to know whether this statement is meant to be taken as commendation and approval or as implying some foreboding, even if not outright critique. The preceding passage has faithful service as its central concern, and such service was carefully explored and ratified in covenant form. That this agreement between Joshua and people holds during the lifetime of the leaders under whom it was forged is testimony to the power of the challenge put by Joshua to the people. However, there lingers the implication that it will not outlive this generation with whom any implicit critique must lie (cf. Ps. 78:5–8).

<span id="page-507-10"></span><span id="page-507-7"></span><span id="page-507-1"></span><span id="page-507-0"></span>24:32 Joseph's burial explicitly recalls the promise he elicited at his death, recorded in Genesis 50:25, that his bones would be carried from Egypt to the Promised Land. The narrative arc, as it is described here, goes back even further, to Genesis 33:19 and Jacob's land purchase at Shechem. Although brief, such deliberate links to Genesis connect the book of Joshua in a meaningful way with that first book. Aside from any compositional theories, it is clear to see why this book could be seen to make a hexateuch, extending the Pentateuch from five books to six.

<span id="page-507-9"></span><span id="page-507-8"></span><span id="page-507-4"></span><span id="page-507-2"></span>24:33 Finally, Eleazar's death and burial are recorded. The noteworthy element here is the naming of Phinehas in order to locate his burial site. Phinehas was active in the settlement of the dispute that threatened civil war in chapter 22, and he forms the living link to the later episodes of Israel's history in the book of Judges.

#### *Response*

To the end, then, the book contains signs of confidence and signals of warning. As has been pointed out on a number of occasions in this commentary, while the dominant tone and trajectory of the books of Joshua and Judges seem on the surface to be so different, a deeper connection and continuity can be seen between them. And that connection is forged more deeply than is sometimes realized. As the book of Judges begins, the death of Joshua is narrated once again, bringing the reader back to the book of Joshua.138 And the double ending of Joshua sets up the reader for the double introduction to Judges.

<sup>138</sup> For a careful exploration of this connectivity cf. Serge Frolov, "Joshua's Double Demise (Josh. xxiv 28–31; Judg. ii 6–9): Making Sense of a Repetition," *VT* 58/3 (2008): 315–323.

One of the gifts of Scripture is that we have both books. Together they do more than serve the ongoing narrative of God's story and Israel's place in it. Reading each book with an awareness of the other affects the perception of both books: (1) The defeats of Judges qualify the victories of Joshua, as seeds of human failure and disobedience take root and grow. (2) At the same time, the victories of Joshua temper the defeats of Judges—God's purpose will ultimately not be thwarted by human weakness.

## INTRODUCTION TO JUDGES

#### *Overview*

<span id="page-511-8"></span><span id="page-511-3"></span><span id="page-511-1"></span><span id="page-511-0"></span>The book of Judges is the second book in a collection of books known as the Former Prophets, which comprise Joshua, Judges, 1–2 Samuel, and 1–2 Kings. Together these books document the period of Israel's occupation of the land of Canaan from their crossing of the Jordan River in Joshua 1–4 to their exile from the land in 2 Kings 17; 25. These books recount the faithfulness of the Lord to fulfill all of his covenant promises made to Israel through Moses. The explicit statement of this purpose appears in strategic locations, first in Joshua and then in 2 Kings. After Joshua has completed the allocation of Israel's inheritance to each of her tribes, it is recorded that "Not one word of all the good promises that the Lord had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass" (Josh. 21:45). Then, at the dedication of the temple Solomon declares, "Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant" (1 Kings 8:56). In the book of Judges the theme of the Lord's faithfulness comes to expression in his raising up of judges to deliver Israel from the subjugation and oppression of enemies brought about by her repeated lapses into idolatry.

<span id="page-511-7"></span><span id="page-511-6"></span><span id="page-511-5"></span><span id="page-511-2"></span>The foil to the theme of the Lord's faithfulness in the Former Prophets is the ongoing and ever-increasing unfaithfulness of Israel to the Lord. This is a major theme in the book of Judges, aptly expressed by the formulaic statement that brackets the conclusion to the book: "In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judg. 17:6; 21:25). The statement that there was no king reflects Israel's rejection of the Lord as her King during this time (cf. 1 Sam. 8:7). This rejection of the Lord as King led to everyone's doing what was right in his own eyes, usually expressed in Judges in terms of idolatry. In fact, each of the six major judge episodes in Judges begins with a variation of the statement "And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth" (Judg. 3:7; cf. 3:12; 4:1; 6:1; 10:6; 13:1). There is a clear relationship between the two statements: the idolatry of Israel was that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord.

<span id="page-511-4"></span>The book of Judges records a period in the life of the nation of Israel between the prophetic leadership of Moses and Joshua and the establishment of the <span id="page-512-3"></span><span id="page-512-2"></span>monarchy in Israel. The wilderness generation of Moses in Exodus through Deuteronomy and the generation of conquest under Joshua had been eyewitnesses of God's great signs and wonders to save and deliver. But then "there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel" (Judg. 2:10). In the generations between Joshua and the kings, Israel did "what was evil in the sight of the Lord" (2:11). The evil described in Judges is portrayed as Israel's progressive decline into idolatry and subsequent moral corruption. The nation of Israel was originally designated by God as a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (Ex. 19:6), but by the end of the book of Judges Israel had become like all of the other nations around her.

#### <span id="page-512-0"></span>*Title*

<span id="page-512-4"></span>The name of the book is derived from the office of the leaders presented in the book, the so-called judges. These individuals were raised up by God to deliver his people from foreign oppression, secure rest for the land, and promote faithfulness to God through the keeping of the covenant (Judg. 2:16–19; 1 Sam. 12:19–25). The office of the judge ceased after Samuel with the emergence of the monarchy in Israel.

#### *Author*

<span id="page-512-8"></span>The human author of the book of Judges is unknown. Some traditions suggest that Samuel was its author (Babylonian Talmud, *Baba Bathra* 14b–15a), but this is impossible to verify. However, since the book of Judges is the Word of God and an undisputed part of the canon of Scripture, it is helpful to remember that the "Spirit of Christ" was at work in the human author who produced this book in its final, canonical form (1 Pet. 1:11). The book of Judges itself provides a fitting analogy to the nature of the authorship of the book. Upon judges such as Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson the Spirit of the Lord rushed, enabling them to deliver Israel. As such, the Lord is to be identified as the agent of deliverance, while the judges serve as the human instrument. In the same way, the Lord is the primary agent behind biblical revelation while the human authors serve as the Spirit-enabled instruments.

#### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-512-7"></span><span id="page-512-1"></span>As with the author, the date and occasion for the composition of the book is unknown. Following the death of Joshua (Judg. 1:1; 2:8), Judges documents a period of time after the generation of Joshua until Samuel's ministry and the establishment of the monarchy recorded in 1–2 Samuel (c. 1360–1084 BC). In Jephthah's negotiations with the Ammonites he notes that Israel has already occupied the territory under dispute for some three hundred years (Judg. 11:26).

<span id="page-512-6"></span><span id="page-512-5"></span>The author's reference to the "captivity of the land" in 18:30 may suggest an exilic or postexilic date of composition. It is also possible, however, that the book came together in stages or that an editor included minor updates, such as time markers, in the final form of the book. Perhaps the accounts of the judges in the <span id="page-513-7"></span><span id="page-513-3"></span><span id="page-513-1"></span>central part of the book (3:7–16:31) are earlier, preexilic compositions and the introductions (1:1–3:6) and conclusions (17:1–21:25) are later, exilic or postexilic compositions. The four references to kingship (17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25) and the strong pro-Judah/anti-Benjamin polemic in the introductions and conclusions suggest a period of composition after the establishment of the Davidic monarchy. For these reasons, someone like Samuel would be the earliest possible author of the book. As the final judge, Samuel would have known about the other judges and the period of time in which they lived (1 Sam. 12:9–11). We also know that Samuel kept records of the affairs of the kingdom (1 Chron. 29:29). Additionally, he was involved in the establishment of the monarchy in Israel and personally experienced the contrast in kingship presented by Saul from Benjamin and David from Judah.

<span id="page-513-11"></span><span id="page-513-10"></span><span id="page-513-9"></span>We may not know everything we would like to know about the authorship or date of composition of Judges. We do know, however, that "whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope" (Rom. 15:4). In this regard, the book of Judges does not disappoint.

#### *Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-513-4"></span>Judges consists primarily of classical Hebrew narrative that includes both narration and discourse (speech). In addition to narrative, we also find the poetic victory song of Deborah (5:2–31), the fable of Jotham (9:8–15), and the riddles and poems of Samson (14:14, 18; 15:16). Instances of repetition, inclusio, wordplay, and curious figures of speech are noted throughout the commentary.

<span id="page-513-5"></span>The most striking literary feature of Judges is the structure of the book as a whole. The macrostructure of the book of Judges comprises two introductions, two conclusions, and twelve judges: six major judges and six minor judges (and one anti-judge, Abimelech).1 In general, the accounts of the major judges become progressively longer as the sin of Israel becomes progressively worse. We also observe that the cost of deliverance for the judge increases as Israel's corruption intensifies.

The two introductions and the two conclusions mirror each other in an A-B-B'-A' pattern (chiasm) as presented below:

- <span id="page-513-2"></span><span id="page-513-0"></span>(A) The Crisis of Israel's Inheritance: Land (1:1–2:5)
	- (B) The Crisis of Israel's Faith: Idolatry (2:6–3:6)
	- (B') The Crisis of Israel's Faith: Idolatry (17:1–18:31)
- <span id="page-513-8"></span><span id="page-513-6"></span>(A') The Crisis of Israel's Inheritance: Tribe (19:1–21:25)

The formulaic beginning of each major judge narrative groups the major judges into two sets of three. Othniel, Ehud, and Deborah/Barak constitute the first group

<sup>1</sup> There are two basic differences between major judges and minor judges. The first difference is the relative length of their accounts. Major judge narratives range from five (Othniel) to approximately one hundred (Gideon and Samson) verses. Minor judge narratives range from only one (Shamgar) to three (Jair, Ibzan, and Abdon) verses. The second difference relates to the formal, recurring elements that appear in each of the major judge narratives. For example, major judge narratives usually include an opening formula, a statement of the people's idolatry, the Lord's anger, and Israel's subjugation by the enemy. Minor judge narratives do not include these elements.

of three, while Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson constitute the second. The author achieves these groupings by slightly altering the opening formula for each of the six major judge accounts.2

(1) Othniel: And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord (3:7).

<span id="page-514-4"></span><span id="page-514-3"></span>(2) Ehud: And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord (3:12).

<span id="page-514-6"></span>(3) Deborah/Barak: And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord (4:1).

<span id="page-514-7"></span>(4) Gideon: And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord (6:1).

<span id="page-514-9"></span>(5) Jephthah: And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord (10:6).

<span id="page-514-11"></span>(6) Samson: And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord (13:1).

The English translations of the second, third, fifth, and sixth opening sentences contain the expression "again did," which links them to the first and fourth opening lines, respectively. In Hebrew the difference is much more noticeable, as the opening sentences begin with a different verb altogether.

<span id="page-514-8"></span><span id="page-514-5"></span>The minor judges fit within the structure of the major judges. They precede and mark climactic major judge narratives with increasing levels of intensity. For example, one minor judge, Shamgar (3:31), precedes the Deborah and Barak account, the climactic judge narrative in the first set of three major judges. Then two minor judges, Tola and Jair (10:1–5), precede the Jephthah account and so mark it as a climactic penultimate judge narrative. Finally, three minor judges, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15), precede the Samson narrative and mark it as the final, climactic judge narrative in the book.

<span id="page-514-10"></span>The arrangement of the book is not chronological but rather theological. The two introductions and two conclusions flank and inform the accounts of the judges, with two sets of three major judges in each group. This structure is represented graphically (cf. figure 3.1).

<span id="page-514-2"></span><span id="page-514-1"></span><span id="page-514-0"></span>The macrostructure of the book appears to be modeled after the days of creation in Genesis 1:1–2:3. In Genesis the opening verses (1:1–2) provide the introduction, followed by six days in two sets of three (1:3–31). These days are then followed by the concluding seventh day (2:1–3). In the Genesis account the narrative moves from chaos in the introduction to the Lord's being enthroned as Sabbath King over the cosmos in the conclusion. In Judges, however, the opposite is true. In the beginning the nation of Israel is relatively faithful under the leadership of Joshua. However, by the time we arrive at the end of the book, we have returned to chaos,

with one tribe unable to possess its inheritance and another tribe having become fully Canaanite. Additionally, in the Genesis account the climax of creation is the Lord's enthronement as Sabbath King over his creation. In Judges, however, the conclusion describes a time without a king in Israel, a tacit statement regarding Israel's rejection of the Lord as King during this time.3 In this way the macrostructure of the book of Judges presents the un-creation of Israel as the people of God.

In addition to the elegant design of the book's macrostructure, each of the six major judge episodes exhibits a basic structure with common narrative elements. All of these design features appear in the first major judge narrative, that of Othniel, which becomes the standard or paradigm for the following judge narratives. These seven features are identified and discussed in the Section Overview of Judges 3:7–11. Not all of the elements appear in each major judge narrative, since variation and adaptation are vital components of literary art.

#### <span id="page-515-4"></span>*Theology of Judges*

#### KINGSHIP (BENJAMIN AND JUDAH)

An important theme in Judges is that of kingship and, more generally, leadership. Under Joshua's leadership Israel prospered and the land had rest. However, when Joshua died the subsequent generations fell into idolatry and corruption, resulting in their subjugation by the nations around them. When the Lord would raise up a

<span id="page-515-6"></span><span id="page-515-5"></span><span id="page-515-3"></span><span id="page-515-2"></span><span id="page-515-1"></span><sup>3</sup> Another striking parallel in structure between the six days of creation and the six major judge narratives is the design of episodes three and six. In Genesis 1 days three and six are *double creation days*. On day three God creates the dry land (vv. 9–10) and then vegetation (vv. 11–12), both of which are independently characterized as "good." On day six God creates animals (vv. 24–25) and then mankind (vv. 26–31), both of which are again independently characterized as "[very] good." In the book of Judges the third and sixth major judge narratives are *double judge narratives*. The third major judge narrative includes two main figures, Deborah and Barak, and two accounts, the narrative account in Judges 4 and the poetic account in Judges 5. In the sixth major judge narrative the account of Samson is clearly divided into two main sections, marked by the repetition of a concluding formula indicating that Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the time of Philistine oppression (15:20; 16:31). The repetition of a concluding formula is the same technique employed in Genesis 1 to mark the two parts of the double creation days. Literary parallels of these types suggest that the author of Judges has intentionally modeled the structure of the book after the pattern of the days of creation in Genesis 1.

<span id="page-516-2"></span>judge, that judge would deliver God's people, secure rest for the land, and promote faithfulness to the Lord. However, "whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them" (Judg. 2:19). The office of judge was not dynastic, so when a judge died the people had to wait for the Lord to raise up another person to serve as judge. This reality made the office of kingship seem desirable because it could provide an uninterrupted succession of faithful leaders who would lead the nation in faithfulness to the Lord.

<span id="page-516-4"></span><span id="page-516-3"></span><span id="page-516-1"></span><span id="page-516-0"></span>This is one reason for the fourfold refrain that appears in the conclusions to the book: "In those days there was no king in Israel" (17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25). These statements begin to prepare us for the advent of the monarchy in Israel as recorded in 1–2 Samuel. Judges also anticipates Israel's monarchy with its pro-Judah (David)/ anti-Benjamin (Saul) polemic that is especially concentrated in the introductions and conclusions to the book. For example, in the first introduction Judah is chosen to lead in battle, Judah possesses its territory, and the Lord is with Judah (Judg. 1:1–20). After some twenty verses recounting Judah's favor, the very next verse (v. 21) records Benjamin's failure to dislodge the Jebusites, in contravention to the laws of occupation. Benjamin's cohabitation with the Jebusites anticipates its eventual corruption recorded in the second conclusion, when the Benjaminites have become Canaanite, even Sodomite, in their moral corruption. Because of this the tribe is put to the ban and, once again, Judah is selected to lead in battle. In the books of 1–2 Samuel the theme of kingship intensifies and the conflict and contrast between Benjamin and Judah continue.

#### COVENANT AND REDEMPTIVE HISTORY

<span id="page-516-5"></span>The Mosaic covenant was an administration of the covenant of grace that governed the life of Israel, granting her the gift of the land of Canaan as an inheritance from the Lord. Israel's tenure in the land depended upon its obedience to this covenant; in the case of disobedience they would be exiled from that land. Since we know the end of story, we know that Israel was not able to maintain obedience to the covenant but was eventually exiled from the land (2 Kings 17; 25). It is important to understand, however, that both the land and the nation of Israel pointed beyond themselves to a better inheritance and a different kind of people. The land of Canaan, like the garden of Eden before it, serves as a shadow, image, or type of the new heavens and the new earth. This is an inheritance that cannot be lost, because the problem of sin and disobedience has been solved with a new kind of people, now including both Jew and Gentile. The people of God are those who have put their faith in the true King anticipated by the book of Judges, King Jesus. He is the one who has defeated the ultimate Enemy, has provided ultimate rest, and has procured an everlasting inheritance.

Even Abraham understood this when he first stepped foot in the land, for "by faith he went to live in the Land of Promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking <span id="page-517-11"></span><span id="page-517-10"></span>forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God" (Heb. 11:9–10). It is helpful to think of the covenant God made with Abraham as finding fulfillment in two stages. The first stage was the temporary, typological administration of the Mosaic covenant. The second stage is the permanent, substantive administration of the new covenant (Col. 2:17; Heb. 8:5; 10:1). In this way we are able to distinguish important continuities and discontinuities between these two administrations of the covenant of grace, as the former points to and prepares for the latter. The ability to distinguish continuity and discontinuity when studying Judges is a key to interpretation and application in the context of the church and the world in which we live.

#### *Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-517-0"></span>As stated in the Overview, Judges is the second book in a group of books known in the Hebrew Bible as the Former Prophets. Together these books testify to the faithfulness of the Lord, who kept all of the covenantal promises he had made to his people through Moses (Josh. 21:45; 1 Kings 8:56). These promises included both blessings for obedience to the terms of the covenant and curses for disobedience to those same terms. The life of the nation of Israel was governed by and measured by the terms of the Mosaic covenant, a temporary and typological administration of the covenant of grace. The Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets) used the Former Prophets as evidence in their prosecution of the Lord's lawsuit against his people for breaking the covenant. In other words, the accounts in the Former Prophets provide the justification and the explanation for the exile.

<span id="page-517-9"></span><span id="page-517-1"></span>Samuel rehearses the period of the Judges when he enters into judgment with Israel for desiring a human king to replace the Lord as their King (1 Sam. 12:6–12). In this context, Samuel explains that the Lord's raising up of judges to deliver his people from the hand of the enemy is just one more example of "all the righteous deeds of the Lord that he performed for you and for your fathers" (1 Sam. 12:7).

<span id="page-517-8"></span><span id="page-517-7"></span><span id="page-517-6"></span><span id="page-517-5"></span><span id="page-517-4"></span><span id="page-517-3"></span><span id="page-517-2"></span>In Psalm 105 the psalmist explains that the Lord "gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil, that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws" (Ps. 105:44–45). Judges demonstrates that the Lord's gift of the "lands of the nations" was not met with the intended response of the people: obedience to the covenant. The period of the Judges is extensively rehearsed in Psalm 106:34–44, in which Israel's disobedience, idolatry, and corruption are contrasted with the Lord's faithfulness to his covenant. When the Lord remembered his covenant, he "relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love" (Ps. 106:45) and "caused [Israel] to be pitied by all those who held them captive" (Ps. 106:46). The way in which the Lord saved his people during the period of the judges became the basis for hope that the Lord could and would continue to deliver his people both in the present and in the future. The pattern of the Lord's faithfulness during the time of the judges provides assurance and serves as the ground for praise and worship (Ps. 106:47–48).

<span id="page-518-7"></span><span id="page-518-6"></span><span id="page-518-5"></span>In the book of Hebrews the judges (specifically Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah) are presented as men of faith who served with distinction in the administration of the kingdom of God (Heb. 11:32–40). These judges were "commended through their faith" (Heb. 11:39) and are now part of that "great . . . cloud of witnesses" who together call us to "look to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith" (Heb. 12:1–2). These judges were raised up by the Lord and empowered by the Spirit to deliver his people from the enemy, secure Israel's inheritance, and promote faithfulness to the covenant. In this way the judges serve as types of Christ. Although the judges themselves are sinful and in need of gospel grace and saving faith, their ministry ultimately points forward to the life and ministry of Christ, the ultimate Judge.

#### *Preaching from Judges*

<span id="page-518-2"></span>The most important thing to remember when preaching, teaching, or studying the book of Judges is the fact that the judges serve as types of Christ. In John 5:39 we are taught that Jesus is the filter through which we must read Judges when he states, "You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; *and it is they that bear witness about me*." The narratives contained in Judges were written to "bear witness," or to "testify," to the person and work of Jesus and the great salvation he has achieved for his people.4

The judges were raised up out of Israel to rescue and deliver the people of God. This does not mean that the judges were perfect or that they never committed sin. They most certainly did, but the book of Judges focuses on how God delivered his people from both their sin (idolatry) and the corruption of that sin (subjugation and oppression by the surrounding nations). The judges served as the weak instruments through which the Lord achieved his great victories. In this way we are reminded that "God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong" (1 Cor. 1:27).

<span id="page-518-4"></span><span id="page-518-3"></span><span id="page-518-1"></span><span id="page-518-0"></span>When preaching from the book of Judges, it is also important to remember the overarching testimony of the Former Prophets as a whole. This would include an emphasis on the faithfulness of the Lord to fulfill all of his promises (Josh. 21:45; 1 Kings 8:56), which serves as another point of reference to the person and work of Christ—"For all the promises of God find their Yes in him" (2 Cor. 1:20). This would also include an emphasis on the ability of the Lord to rescue and deliver his people from corruption and oppression, with a corresponding emphasis on our needing to be rescued from our own sin and corruption.

We are instructed by the apostle Paul that Judges was written for our instruction and encouragement, in order to promote endurance and hope in the life of the believer: "Whatever was written in former days was written for our *instruction*, that through *endurance* and through the *encouragement* of the Scriptures we might

<sup>4</sup> For the system of interpretation employed in this commentary cf. Miles V. Van Pelt, "Introduction," in *A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the Old Testament: The Gospel Promised*, ed. Miles V. Van Pelt (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2016), 23–42.

<span id="page-519-0"></span>have *hope*" (Rom. 15:4). The narratives of the judges remind us that God never gives up on his people but is always in pursuit of us because of his grace, mercy, and steadfast love. Even when he sold or gave his people over to the hand of the enemy in Judges because of their idolatry, he did so to provoke repentance, so that he might turn and deliver yet again.

<span id="page-519-1"></span>Paul also teaches that narratives like those in Judges serve as a point of warning for God's people. Although the historical references in 1 Corinthians 10 focus of the wilderness generation under Moses, they also apply to the events recorded in the book of Judges and instruct us in how to appropriate this material in our preaching and teaching. Paul's writes,

These things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play." We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. (1 Cor. 10:6–13)

<span id="page-519-2"></span>Judges warns us so "that we might not desire evil as they did" and so that we may know in the midst of our temptations in life that the Lord "will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it." Judges is, indeed, Christian Scripture. It points us to Christ, warns us against giving in to temptation, and provides us with encouragement, hope, and endurance. Because books such as Judges are often neglected in the church, preaching from it in the ways suggested above should provide new, and perhaps unexpected, moments of encouragement for the church.

#### *Interpretative Challenges*

#### VIOLENCE AND HOLY WAR

The narratives in Judges contain much violence, including executions, torture, and warfare. If some of these narratives were adapted for the modern screen, they would definitely require parental warnings. One of the more difficult aspects of this violence is the Lord's command for the Israelites to destroy the Canaanites completely from the land they were to possess. This is sometimes called "holy war," or putting people "under the ban." When a people or nation was put under the ban, it was to be completely destroyed, including all men, women, children, and possessions.

<span id="page-520-4"></span>There are two main reasons for this command in the context of the Mosaic covenant. First, the Lord commanded the destruction of the Canaanites in order to protect Israel from adopting their forms of worship and corrupt practices. The legislation for this practice is found in Deuteronomy 7:1–11. It includes the rationale that the Canaanites would "turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods" (Deut.7:4). The nature of this conquest is described also in Exodus 23:23–33, which concludes, "They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you" (Ex. 23:33).

<span id="page-520-3"></span><span id="page-520-2"></span><span id="page-520-1"></span><span id="page-520-0"></span>Second, the command of complete destruction foreshadows the eschatological judgment that will come against all sin and those who do not repent from it by placing faith in Christ alone. As do the flood in Genesis 6–9 and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19, the extermination of the Canaanites serves as a terrible and sobering reminder of the certain wrath of God's final judgment against sin and idolatry.5 In Judges it is not only the Canaanites who come under this terrible judgment. By the end of the book the tribe of Benjamin will be put under the ban because of their Canaanite-like corruption.

#### MODERN INTERPRETATION

<span id="page-520-5"></span>Modern approaches to the book of Judges tend to portray the judges in a fairly negative manner, with a focus on character flaws and questionable moral behavior. In this commentary, however, the actions of the judges are neither rigorously impugned nor assiduously defended. As stated above, every judge was a sinner in need of gospel grace and saving faith. In the book of Hebrews, the judges are identified as people of such faith. They were those "who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight" (Heb. 11:33–34). These judges were those "of whom the world was not worthy" and so also "commended through their faith" (Heb. 11:38–39). In the tradition of God's working his strength through human weakness, the judges serve in the economy of the covenant of grace under the administration of the Mosaic covenant to deliver Israel from the oppression caused by their idolatry. Consider a reference to the judges in *Sirach* 46:11–12, a work produced after the completion of the OT but before the time of Christ. The author, Ben Sira, wrote,

<span id="page-520-6"></span> The judges also, with their respective names, those whose hearts did not fall into idolatry and who did not turn away from the Lord may their memory be blessed! May their bones revive from where they lie, and may the name of those who have been honored live again in their sons!

<sup>5</sup> Meredith G. Kline, "The Intrusion and the Decalogue," *WTJ* 16 (1953): 1–22, esp. 15–16.

This is perhaps an overstatement by Ben Sira, but the point is well taken. The judges point God's people to their true Savior and King and so are commended for their faith and faithfulness. If we will let them, they can continue to serve the church in the same way today.6

#### THE OFFICE OF THE JUDGE IN ISRAEL

The title of "judge" can be rather confusing in many modern contexts. We normally think of a distinguished lawyer who wears a robe, sits behind a large desk, and renders legal decisions. Of all the judges in the book, only Deborah approximates that role. It is important not to equate the role of Israel's ancient judges with judges in our own modern contexts. Israel's judges were raised up by the Lord and empowered by the Spirit of the Lord in order to achieve victory in battle, deliver God's people, and secure rest for the land. It is better to think of the judges as God's *instruments of judgment* on the nations who oppressed and afflicted Israel. In this way, the judicial nature of their office finds expression in the economy of the kingdom of God.

### <span id="page-522-0"></span>JUDGES 1:1–2:5

1 After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the Lord, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?" **2**The Lord said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand." **3**And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you." So Simeon went with him. **4**Then Judah went up and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek. **5**They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. **6**Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. **7**And Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.

**<sup>8</sup>**And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. **9**And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland. **10**And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.

**<sup>11</sup>**From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher. **12**And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife." **13**And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife. **14**When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" **<sup>15</sup>** She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

**<sup>16</sup>**And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people. **17**And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called Hormah.*<sup>1</sup>* **<sup>18</sup>** Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. **19**And the Lord was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron. **20**And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak. **21**But the people of

Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.

**<sup>22</sup>**The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them. **23**And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.) **24**And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you." **25**And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. **26**And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day.

**<sup>27</sup>**Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. **28**When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.

**<sup>29</sup>**And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.

**30**Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.

**<sup>31</sup>**Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob, **<sup>32</sup>** so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.

**<sup>33</sup>**Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.

**<sup>34</sup>**The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain. **35**The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. **36**And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.

2 Now the angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you, **<sup>2</sup>** and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done? **<sup>3</sup>** So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you." **4**As soon as the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept. **5**And they called the name of that place Bochim.*<sup>2</sup>* And they sacrificed there to the Lord.

#### *Section Overview*

The book of Judges opens with brief and selective accounts of Israel's occupation of the land of Canaan after the death of Joshua. Israel's conquest of the land under the

<span id="page-524-4"></span><span id="page-524-3"></span>leadership of Joshua was extensive but partial (cf. Joshua 12). According to Joshua 13, much of the land remained to be conquered as the nation of Israel increased and expanded. This first introduction to Judges describes Israel's relative failure to occupy the land fully and to remove the Canaanites from its midst. Not every tribe of Israel is listed in Judges 1, but those that are listed provide ample testimony to the life of Israel between the days of Joshua and of Samuel.

<span id="page-524-6"></span><span id="page-524-1"></span><span id="page-524-0"></span>It is important to remember that Israel's conquest of Canaan is an act of faith in obedience to the commands of their covenant with the Lord (Deut. 7:1–5). The Lord leads Israel's army and fights as the commander of that army. Israel is to destroy the inhabitants of the land in order to avoid corruption by those inhabitants. For, as the Lord had said, "They would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods" (Deut. 7:4). This warning undergirds the history recorded in Judges. Israel's failure to destroy the Canaanites results in idolatry, subjugation, and suffering for God's people. In this context the Lord raises up the judges to deliver and sustain his people in the midst of their sin. In these narratives we witness the steadfast love of the Lord towards his people in grace and mercy.

In this first introduction to Judges we encounter the crisis of Israel's inheritance. The relative success of the tribe of Judah is contrasted sharply with the other tribes listed in these accounts, especially the tribe of Benjamin. This section concludes with the appearance of the angel of the Lord, bringing a theological and spiritual assessment of Israel's failure to expel the inhabitants of the land of her inheritance.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-524-7"></span><span id="page-524-5"></span><span id="page-524-2"></span>1:1 The book of Judges begins by referring to the death of Joshua first recorded in Joshua 24:29–30, providing the historical anchor for the accounts and narratives of the judges that follow. This death notice also serves an important literary function. At the end of Deuteronomy the death of Moses is recorded (Deut. 34:5–8). Then, in the first verse of the book of Joshua, Moses' death is referenced again. In fact, the opening words of the book of Joshua are identical to those of Judges: <span id="page-525-3"></span><span id="page-525-2"></span><span id="page-525-1"></span>"After the death of . . ." (Josh. 1:1; Judg. 1:1). These brief death notices at the end and beginning of each book tie together Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges as a literary unit, a faithful record of the narrative of the kingdom of God. Similarly, the book of Genesis ends with the death of Joseph (Gen. 50:26), which is subsequently repeated in the opening verses of Exodus (Ex. 1:6). The appearance of these death notices at important and strategic locations establish and shape major portions of the record of the administration of the covenant of grace. As such, they each point forward to the one death recorded in the Bible that puts death to death and secures the faithfulness of the people of God once and for all.

Following the reference to the death of Joshua, it is recorded that "the people of Israel inquired of the Lord" as to who or which tribe should lead or "go up" in battle against the Canaanites. Now that both Moses and Joshua are dead, the question of leadership naturally arises. The Israelites are right to consult the Lord in this matter, and his answer begins to shape not only the rest of the chapter but the rest of redemptive history. The verb "to go up" is a key word in this first introduction to the book of Judges. In Judges 1:1 the Israelites ask, "Who shall go up?" In verse 2 the Lord chooses Judah to "go up" and lead the Israelites. Then Simeon (v. 3), the Kenites (v. 16), the house of Joseph (v. 22), and finally the angel of the Lord (2:1) "go up" in the context of Israel's conquest and occupation of the land.

<span id="page-525-8"></span><span id="page-525-7"></span><span id="page-525-5"></span><span id="page-525-4"></span>1:2 The Lord responds to Israel's inquiry with the selection of the tribe of Judah as the one who should "go up" and lead in battle. As the Section Outline demonstrates, Judah is the focus of Judges 1, spanning from verses 2 to 20. The significance of the tribe of Judah reaches back into Genesis and then forward all the way to the final chapter of the Bible. In Genesis 49:10 Jacob prophetically identifies the tribe of Judah with the royal line of Israel:

<span id="page-525-0"></span> The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.

<span id="page-525-12"></span><span id="page-525-11"></span><span id="page-525-10"></span>Further fulfillment comes in the selection of David as king (1 Sam. 16:1–13) and the establishment of the Davidic covenant that follows (2 Sam. 7:8–17), forever securing the royal line for Judah. The NT identifies Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the royal promises to Judah through the line of David. In fact, the NT is bracketed by references to this reality (Matt. 1:1; Rev. 22:16). Four times in the conclusions to the book of Judges we read the famous statement, "In those days there was no king in Israel" (Judg. 17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25). Given that the king of Israel will ultimately come from the tribe of Judah, it is no accident that this tribe is the focus of chapter 1.

<span id="page-525-9"></span><span id="page-525-6"></span>1:3 Before Judah leads in battle, it invites the tribe of Simeon to partner with it in the conquest of its territory. Judah would then do the same for Simeon. At one level this request is pragmatic, since the territory of Simeon is situated within J udges 1:1–2:5 526

<span id="page-526-4"></span><span id="page-526-3"></span>the territory of Judah.7 Some may understand this alliance as a lack of faith on the part of Judah, but this is likely not the case. The tradition of tribal fidelity and partnership goes back to the days of Moses, specifically Numbers 32. Before Israel crossed the Jordan into Canaan, the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh settled in lands east of the Jordan (cf. Joshua 13). After this the men of these tribes pledged to fight with the rest of Israel until all of the tribes had received their inheritance in the land. A similar arrangement seems to be at work here in Judges 1, and this may explain the relative success of Judah when compared to the accounts of the other tribes in this same chapter.

<span id="page-526-6"></span><span id="page-526-5"></span>1:4 In obedience to the command of the Lord, the tribe of Judah "went up" to fight against the Canaanites and the Perizzites. It is helpful to understand that references to the current inhabitants of land are variously phrased, and often in a selective or representative manner, much like the accounting of the tribes of Israel in this same chapter (cf. Ex. 3:8, 17; 13:5; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11; Deut. 7:1; Josh. 3:10).

<span id="page-526-1"></span><span id="page-526-0"></span>The victory of Judah is not their own doing, for "the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand." This should remind us of one of the most important principles of Israel's military victories: it is the Lord who fights for Israel (Ex. 14:14; 15:3). The land was filled with "seven nations more numerous and mightier" than Israel (Deut. 7:1), each of which would test the faith of Israel to rely fully upon their covenant-keeping God, who is faithful to uphold all of his promises.

The verse concludes with the location of the battle, Bezek, and the number of the enemy slain, ten thousand. The reference to Bezek introduces a brief narrative concerning "Adoni-bezek" (Judg. 1:5) the "lord" of that land.

<span id="page-526-9"></span><span id="page-526-8"></span><span id="page-526-7"></span>1:5–7 In verse 4 it was recorded that Judah struck down ten thousand men at Bezek. Now in these verses the author focuses on just one of the men from that city: Adoni-bezek, its king. While fighting the Canaanites and the Perizzites at Bezek, the tribe of Judah located Adoni-bezek. The narrative account of his capture in verses 5–6 is quick and straightforward. The Judahites find him, fight against him, pursue him, capture him, and then cut off his thumbs and first toes. The description of the battle is rather generic until the final event described, the cutting off of his thumbs and first toes. This is certainly an act of humiliation, one that would render the king unable to hold a sword or run in battle. However, this is also an event unique in the Bible. Nowhere else do we read of such treatment. In fact, the only other context in which thumbs and first toes appear in the Bible is in a cultic context (Ex. 29:20; Lev. 8:23–24; 14:14, 17, 25, 28). Perhaps the capture and subjugation of Adoni-bezek is to be understood as an act of consecration and purification of the land as Israel removes the enemies of God.

<span id="page-526-10"></span><span id="page-526-2"></span>In many OT narratives a brief concluding speech can help illuminate the nature and significance of that narrative. Here in Judges 1:7 the words of Adonibezek are recorded to help the reader to understand something of the nature of

<sup>7</sup> Cf. John D. Currid and David P. Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas* (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2010), 107, map 4.13.

<span id="page-527-9"></span><span id="page-527-2"></span><span id="page-527-1"></span><span id="page-527-0"></span>the events recorded in verses 5–6. First, we learn that Adoni-bezek had cut off the thumbs and toes of seventy other kings. Additionally, he understands that his own subjugation is repayment from God, an eye-for-eye approach (Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21). The reference to seventy kings is an impressive number. It may echo the seventy nations listed in the table of nations in Genesis 10.8 The account concludes with Adoni-bezek's being brought to Jerusalem, where he subsequently dies. This is not the last time a king will die in Jerusalem in order for God's people to possess their inheritance.

<span id="page-527-16"></span><span id="page-527-12"></span><span id="page-527-11"></span><span id="page-527-10"></span><span id="page-527-8"></span>1:8–11 The text records in rapid succession the subsequent victories of Judah in its conquest of the land according to its allotment. Judah conquers Jerusalem (Judg. 1:8); the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland (the Shephelah) (v. 9); Hebron (v. 10); and Debir (v. 11). Jerusalem appears three times in Judges 1 (vv. 7, 8, 21). The book anticipates the coming of kingship in its final chapters (17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25), but the development of this theme begins in chapter 1, with its emphasis on Judah and its repeated mention of Jerusalem, the future city of David. In fact, Hebron and Jerusalem, both mentioned here, are the two capital cities from which David reigns during his forty years as king (2 Sam. 5:5; 1 Kings 2:11). The facts presented in these first few chapters of Judges stand on their own. However, they are also intended to prepare and shape the way in which we view the unfolding of redemptive history in the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and beyond, especially as it relates to kingship and the kingdom of God.

<span id="page-527-19"></span><span id="page-527-18"></span><span id="page-527-17"></span><span id="page-527-14"></span><span id="page-527-13"></span><span id="page-527-6"></span>1:12–15 Once again the author pauses in his progression of the narrative, this time to provide additional information regarding the conquest of Debir (Kiriathsepher) recorded in Judges 1:11. This is the account of Caleb, Othniel, and Achsah the daughter of Caleb. These events are first recorded in Joshua 15:16–19 and are repeated here.

<span id="page-527-7"></span><span id="page-527-4"></span><span id="page-527-3"></span>Caleb was one of the original twelve spies sent by Moses to explore Canaan in preparation for Israel's conquest and occupation (Num. 13:6). He was the representative of the tribe of Judah and one of two spies to bring back a positive report regarding Israel's prospects for occupation (Num. 13:30; 14:6–9). Because of Caleb's faith, he was one of only two men (with Joshua) to enter the land of Israel's inheritance among that original generation who crossed the Red Sea. "My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it" (Num. 14:24; cf. 14:30, 38).

<span id="page-527-15"></span><span id="page-527-5"></span>As part of Judah's conquest, Caleb offered the reward of marriage to his daughter Achsah for the man who would capture Debir. That man turned out to be Othniel, Caleb's younger relative. We do not know how Othniel captured the city or why Caleb offered his daughter in marriage for that city. We only know that

<sup>8</sup> James B. Jordan, *Judges: God's War against Humanism* (Tyler, TX: Geneva Ministries, 1985), 4. It is also possible that seventy is a simple round number or intended to be understood as hyperbole; cf. Daniel I. Block, *Judges, Ruth*, NAC 6 (Nashville: B&H, 1999), 91. Later Abimelech will execute seventy of his half-brothers (Judg. 9:5); cf. Robert B. Chisholm Jr., *A Commentary on Judges and Ruth*, KEL (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Academic, 2013), 122.

Othniel took the city and received Achsah as his bride. The image of a victorious warrior and a willing bride should remind us of our own great hope as portrayed in Revelation 20–21.

<span id="page-528-14"></span><span id="page-528-12"></span><span id="page-528-11"></span>Upon marriage Achsah requested from her father a field along with springs of water as a "blessing."9 Since the field was in the drier lands of the Negeb, her request for springs of water would ensure the productivity of the land and the maintenance of livestock. Achsah's determination to ensure the well-being of her family is reminiscent of the woman of Proverbs 31, who "considers a field and buys [or "takes"] it" (Prov. 31:16) and "looks well to [or "watches over"] the ways of her household" (Prov. 31:27). With Othniel and Achsah we have the picture of a faithful warrior husband (cf. Num. 32:12) and a wise and discerning wife. This picture contributes to the generally positive focus on Judah in Judges. It also introduces us to the first judge in the book, Othniel (Judg. 3:7–11). The account of his service establishes the pattern or standard for all of the judges who will follow.

<span id="page-528-13"></span><span id="page-528-8"></span><span id="page-528-7"></span><span id="page-528-4"></span><span id="page-528-2"></span><span id="page-528-1"></span><span id="page-528-0"></span>1:16 The Kenites are the family of Zipporah, the wife of Moses (Ex. 2:15–21). Moses' father-in-law was a priest of Midian; it appears that he was called both Reuel (Exodus 2) and Jethro (Exodus 18). In Exodus 18 Jethro delivers Moses' wife and children to him after he has "heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt" (Ex. 18:1). It is also recorded in Exodus 18:27 that Moses sent away his father-in-law, who returned to his land. It appears, however, that Jethro's son Hobab, brother of Zipporah, remained with Moses and the people of Israel. Additionally, when it was time for Israel to journey into the land of its inheritance, Moses invited Hobab to remain with Israel. Evidence for this accounting appears in Numbers 10:29:

<span id="page-528-3"></span>Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the Lord has promised good to Israel."

<span id="page-528-9"></span><span id="page-528-5"></span>The mention of the Kenites might seem out of place in this context. However, as with the account of Othniel in the previous verses, the presence of the Kenites in Judges 1 prepares us for Judges 4–5. In the narratives of Deborah and Barak we are introduced to Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite (4:11, 17) who is "of tentdwelling women most blessed" (5:24). She will play an important role in the deliverance of God's people from the oppression of Jabin, king of Canaan, and his commander, Sisera.

<span id="page-528-10"></span>The presence of the Kenites among the Israelites in the land of inheritance constitutes one of the early ways in which we see the nations experiencing the blessing of Abraham that "in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed"

<span id="page-528-6"></span><sup>9</sup> In Judges 1:14 Achsah appears to ask Othniel to ask her father for a field, but then she is the one who makes the request: "When she came to him [Othniel], she urged him [Othniel] to ask her father [Caleb] for a field." However, we could also understand Caleb to be the antecedent of the masculine pronoun: "When she came, she urged him [Caleb] by asking for a field from her father."

<span id="page-529-0"></span>(Gen. 12:3). Details such as this help readers to focus on the progression of the kingdom of God in redemptive history and the fulfillment of his promises to Abraham. "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, 'In you shall all the nations be blessed'" (Gal. 3:8).

<span id="page-529-10"></span><span id="page-529-4"></span><span id="page-529-3"></span>1:17 This verse records the fulfillment of Judah's obligation to fight alongside Simeon in the occupation of its inheritance (cf. Judg. 1:3). The nature of the warfare in which Israel is engaged is memorialized in the renaming of the city of Zephath as "Hormah." The verb translated "devoted to destruction" in this verse shares the same root as the new name of the city, Hormah. Thus the name of the city could be rendered as something like "Devoted to Destruction" or "Total Destruction." This type of warfare was commanded by God in order to remove that which was evil from the land of Israel's inheritance and to protect her from the corruption of that evil. The regulations and rationale for this command are recorded in Deuteronomy 7:1–6.

<span id="page-529-1"></span>Wars of this type are no longer sanctioned by the Bible—nor are they the universal pattern throughout the OT. The conquest of Canaan is commanded by the Lord as the means by which Israel would possess her inheritance and punish the inhabitants of the land for the fullness of their sin. At times in the history of redemption the rule of common grace has been suspended and the ethics of consummation have prevailed (e.g., the flood, the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Red Sea, and the destruction of the Canaanites).10 These fierce and terrible acts of God warn his people, in real time and space, of the nature of final judgment and the power of the Judge in bringing his wrath against sin (Rev. 19:11). Now, because of the victory of Christ over sin and death,

<span id="page-529-11"></span>the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete. (2 Cor. 10:4–6)

<span id="page-529-9"></span><span id="page-529-5"></span><span id="page-529-2"></span>1:18 The text returns to Judah's conquest and possession of its inheritance in the land. It is recorded that Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron. These three cities are often associated with the Philistines (Josh. 13:3), a people who afflict Israel all the way through the time of David. In terms of the upcoming judge narratives, Shamgar (Judg. 3:31) and Samson provide temporary deliverance from Philistine oppression. In fact, all of Judges 16 records Samson's dealings with the Philistines in Gaza, one of the cities listed here.

<span id="page-529-8"></span><span id="page-529-7"></span><span id="page-529-6"></span>1:19 Judah's relative success in conquest and the possession of its inheritance is explained by the power of God's presence in its midst: "And the Lord was with

<span id="page-530-16"></span><span id="page-530-11"></span><span id="page-530-2"></span><span id="page-530-1"></span><span id="page-530-0"></span>Judah" (v. 19). It is God's presence that explains the special status of God's people and their ability possess the land (Ex. 33:16). It is also God's presence that enables and empowers the judges to rescue and deliver Israel from the opposition of their enemies, for "whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge" (Judg. 2:18). The promise and the power of God's presence are also manifested among the patriarchs (Gen. 26:3; 31:3), Moses (Ex. 3:12; 4:12), Joshua (Deut. 31:23; Josh. 1:5), Gideon (Judg. 6:12), and even now with the church: "Behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:20). The promise of the divine presence also serves as our ultimate eschatological hope and satisfaction: "I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God" (Rev. 21:3). The theme of divine presence runs from creation to consummation, and we are wise to see that same theme runs through the book of Judges as God works with and through these faithful servants of the kingdom (Heb. 11:32–39).

<span id="page-530-18"></span><span id="page-530-17"></span><span id="page-530-14"></span><span id="page-530-12"></span><span id="page-530-9"></span><span id="page-530-6"></span>Immediately following the statement that the Lord was with Judah, it is recorded that Judah was not able to dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, "because [the inhabitants of the valley] had chariots of iron" (Judg. 1:19; cf. Josh. 17:16, 18). We will learn later that the Lord allows some nations to remain in the land in order to test Israel to see if they would "walk in the way of the Lord as their fathers did" (Judg. 2:21–23). We also know that the conquest of the land will not reach its fullness until the days of David and Solomon (2 Sam. 7:1; 1 Kings 8:56). In other words, in some instances the remnant of the Canaanites in the land provides occasions for the Lord to test the faith of his people and to provoke hope in the full and final occupation of the land, that is, in entering into the promise of rest. Finally, the reference to the "chariots of iron" in these introductory verses prepares us to witness the power of the Lord to overcome nine hundred chariots of iron through the leadership of Deborah and Barak (Judg. 4:3, 13).

<span id="page-530-15"></span><span id="page-530-13"></span><span id="page-530-10"></span><span id="page-530-8"></span><span id="page-530-5"></span><span id="page-530-3"></span>1:20 The final verse in the account of the conquest of Judah returns to Caleb (cf. comment on 1:12–15). Here it is recorded once again that Caleb was given Hebron as his inheritance (Josh. 15:13–14; 21:11–12). This reference to Caleb's possession of Hebron brings the account of the conquest of Judah to a strong conclusion. It is stated that Caleb's possession of Hebron came by the command of Moses, connecting us back to Joshua 14:6–15. Here we learn that Caleb's possession of Hebron was granted because of his faithfulness to the Lord, specifically with reference to spying out the land, bringing a good report, and being willing to engage the Anakim in battle. "Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the Lord, the God of Israel" (Josh. 14:14).

<span id="page-530-7"></span><span id="page-530-4"></span>Reference to the Anakim, or the three sons of Anak, first appears in Judges 1:10, where their names are given: "Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai." The Anakim <span id="page-531-7"></span><span id="page-531-5"></span><span id="page-531-4"></span><span id="page-531-0"></span>were famous warriors and giants, descendants of the Nephilim: "And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them" (Num. 13:33; cf. Gen. 6:4). These are people "of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'" (Deut. 9:2). Caleb's defeat of the Anakim is an act of faithful obedience, trusting in the power of God to defeat one's enemy (Josh. 14:12). This type of faith is the key to Israel's conquest and occupation of the land. With Caleb we are reminded of another champion from Judah who will defeat another giant, again an act of faith and trust in the living God who gives strength to the weak (1 Sam. 17:45–46; 2 Cor. 12:9–10). This theme of God's strength working through human weakness runs throughout the book of Judges.

<span id="page-531-16"></span><span id="page-531-15"></span><span id="page-531-10"></span><span id="page-531-9"></span>1:21 The lengthy and positive account of the tribe of Judah is abruptly contrasted with the brief and negative account of the tribe of Benjamin. Both the syntax and the content of the Hebrew text work together to highlight this contrast. Earlier in Judges 1:8 it was recorded that "Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire." But now it is recorded that Benjamin was unable to expel the Jebusites from that city and subsequently coexisted with them, something expressly forbidden by the Lord. By the end of Judges (chs. 19–20) Benjamin will become Canaanite, like Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). This contrast between Judah and Benjamin runs throughout the book and is yet another way in which the theme of kingship is developed. Judah's success in Jerusalem and Benjamin's failure in Gibeah provide a preliminary, prophetic assessment of Israel's first two kings: Saul of Gibeah, (from the tribe of Benjamin) and David of Bethlehem (from the tribe of Judah), who will finally conquer and reign from Jerusalem.

<span id="page-531-14"></span><span id="page-531-13"></span><span id="page-531-11"></span><span id="page-531-1"></span>1:22–23 Following the brief account of Benjamin is this longer account of the "house of Joseph." This account runs all the way through verse 29, with a final mention in verse 35. As in the assessment of the churches in Revelation 2–3, the assessment of the tribes of Israel in Judges 1 ranges from good (Judah) to both good and bad (Joseph) and to wholly bad (Benjamin).

<span id="page-531-12"></span><span id="page-531-8"></span><span id="page-531-2"></span>In Judges 1 the reference to a tribe as a "house" occurs only with respect to Joseph. The house of Joseph comprises the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim; the individual accounts of these tribes follow in verses 27–29. Manasseh and Ephraim were the sons of Joseph, born in Egypt to him and his Egyptian wife Asenath, "daughter of Potiphera priest of On" (Gen. 41:45; 46:20). Joseph was the favored son of Jacob and received the blessing of the firstborn, that is, a double portion of the father's inheritance (Deut. 21:17). This double portion came to expression in Jacob's adoption of Manasseh and Ephraim as his own sons (Gen. 48:5–20), thus ensuring Joseph's favored status as firstborn. This favored status is also expressed in the size of the inheritance allotments of these two tribes in the land.11 The

<span id="page-531-6"></span><span id="page-531-3"></span><sup>11</sup> For a visual representation of the territory of East Manasseh, West Manasseh, and Ephraim cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 107, map 4.13. The total territory of Manasseh is especially large.

J udges 1:1–2:5 532

doubling of the tribe of Joseph preserved the division of the land into twelve allotments—the tribe of Levi did not receive any land as an inheritance, for the Lord is their inheritance (Num. 18:20, 24; Deut. 10:9; 18:1; Josh. 13:14, 33; 18:7).

<span id="page-532-8"></span><span id="page-532-7"></span><span id="page-532-3"></span><span id="page-532-0"></span>The account of the house of Joseph focuses on the capture of the city of Bethel. Although Bethel was located in the allotment of Benjamin, it was Joseph who captured the city. As the Lord was "with" Judah (Judg. 1:19), so the Lord is "with" Joseph in the conquest of Bethel. Only in regard to these two tribes in Judges 1 is it recorded that the divine presence secures their success. The reference to the previous name of Bethel—Luz—brings to mind the events of Genesis 28. There Jacob received the vision of a ladder reaching into heaven and the assurance of divine presence and protection. When he awoke from his vision he remarked, "'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.' And he was afraid and said, 'How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God [*bet 'elohim*], and this is the gate of heaven'" (Gen. 28:16–17). Thus it was Jacob who gave the name Bethel to this city (Gen. 28:19). The city serves as an important location in the second conclusion to the book of Judges. It is there that Israel inquires of the Lord regarding Benjamin (Judg. 20:18), and it is there that they weep over Benjamin (20:26; 21:2).

<span id="page-532-15"></span><span id="page-532-14"></span><span id="page-532-9"></span><span id="page-532-5"></span><span id="page-532-2"></span><span id="page-532-1"></span>1:24–26 The spies sent out by Joseph to Bethel (Luz) come upon a man from the city who shows them its entrance. This providence leads to the city's defeat by the "edge [or "mouth"] of the sword." Because of this man's help Israel dealt "kindly" (Hb. *hesed*) with him by allowing him and his family to depart safely from the city. This alliance and act of kindness reminds us of Rahab and the defeat of Jericho (Joshua 2; 6). Rahab's assistance to the spies in Jericho secured her safety along with that of her family. This man does not remain with Israel, however, but sets out and builds another city called Luz, in the land of the Hittites. Rahab, on the other hand, repented of her previous life, married an Israelite (Salmon), and became a member of the line of David (Josh. 6:25; Matt. 1:5; Heb. 11:31; James 2:25). It is not always what one is "saved from" that matters most. It is also what one is "saved to" that will have lasting consequences.

<span id="page-532-13"></span><span id="page-532-12"></span><span id="page-532-11"></span><span id="page-532-10"></span><span id="page-532-6"></span><span id="page-532-4"></span>1:27 Three themes run through the remaining verses of this chapter. The first is Israel's failure to "drive out" the inhabitants of the land. The second is the related fact that Israel will then live among the Canaanites. The third is that the Canaanites will become subject "to forced labor" (Judg. 1:28) by the Israelites. In this verse Manasseh (from the house of Joseph) fails to drive out the inhabitants of five cities and their villages. As a result "the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land." The Lord had warned Israel of the danger of this situation, that these remaining peoples would become a snare to them (Deut. 7:16; 12:29–31; Josh. 23:12–13; Judg. 2:3). Israel's cohabitation with the Canaanites results not in the sanctification of the Canaanites but in the corruption of Israel. This is the storyline of Judges. The theme of the nation of Israel during the days of the judges is that they "did what was evil in the sight of the Lord" (Judg. 2:11; 3:7, 12; 4:1; 6:1; 10:6; 13:1). This evil

<span id="page-533-7"></span>is always expressed in terms of idolatry. For example, in 2:11 it is recorded that "the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals." In other words, the longer Israel lived among the pagan inhabitants of the land, the more they became like them, worshiping their gods and forsaking the one true God, who had redeemed them from Egypt and brought them into the land of their inheritance. Moses had predicted this very situation just prior to his death:

I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you. And in the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do *what is evil in the sight of the Lord*, provoking him to anger through the work of your hands. (Deut. 31:29)

<span id="page-533-3"></span><span id="page-533-1"></span><span id="page-533-0"></span>1:28 The theme of "forced labor" appears in Judges 1:28, 30, 33, and 35. Here it is stated that "Israel" subjects the Canaanites to forced labor, but this statement occurs within the context of the conquest of Manasseh and Ephraim. The tribes of Zebulun, Naphtali, and Joseph will also be listed in this section as subjecting the remaining inhabitants of the land to forced labor. As such, these tribes are representative of all the tribes of Israel. In other words, what is true for these tribes is true for the remaining tribes of Israel as well. The conscription of the Canaanites into forced labor in this first introduction to Judges comes to ironic expression in later accounts of the book. Because of Israel's idolatry, the Lord will give his people over to oppression by those they have oppressed.

<span id="page-533-2"></span>1:29 Bringing to a conclusion the account of the house of Joseph, which comprises Manasseh and Ephraim, it is recorded that Ephraim fails to drive out the inhabitants of Gezer; subsequently those Canaanites live among them. Thus the assessment of the house of Joseph is mixed. United as the house of Joseph, it experiences success in the capture of Hebron. However, as individual tribes they fail to drive out the inhabitants of other cities. This failure will provide the social context for Israel's progressive corruption throughout the book.

<span id="page-533-5"></span><span id="page-533-4"></span>1:30–33 These few verses complete the selective account of Israel's possession and occupation of the land that will provide the social and theological context for the upcoming judge narratives. The final tribes listed include Zebulun (v. 30), Asher (vv. 31–32), and Naphtali (v. 33). The same three themes of failure to drive out the Canaanites, cohabitation with the Canaanites, and forced labor of the Canaanites run throughout these short accounts. All three themes appear together with Zebulun in verse 30 and Naphtali in verse 33. For example, (1) "Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol," (2) "so the Canaanites lived among them," but (3) "became subject to forced labor." Only themes 1 and 2 appear with the tribe of Asher in verses 31–32, but this is likely due to the selective nature of the accounts.

<span id="page-533-6"></span>1:34–36 The final account in this first chapter of Judges records not Israel's subjugation of the Canaanites but the Amorites oppression of the Israelites. The J udges 1:1–2:5 534

<span id="page-534-3"></span><span id="page-534-2"></span><span id="page-534-1"></span>designation "Canaanite" is the more general designation for the various nations that reside in the land of Canaan at this time. These tribes are descended from Canaan son of Ham, son of Noah. The "sons of Ham" were "Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan" (Gen. 10:6). And "Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth, and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites" (Gen. 10:15–18). These are the people groups that fall under the curse delivered by Noah in Genesis 9:25–27 whereby the enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the Serpent is preserved after the flood (cf. Gen. 3:15). The Amorites also appear in Genesis 15 when God explains to Abram that his offspring must wait four generations before occupying the land as their possession because "the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete" (Gen. 15:16). With Israel's occupation of the land at hand, the sin of the Amorites is now complete—and the seed of the Serpent does not yield without a fight.

<span id="page-534-15"></span><span id="page-534-7"></span><span id="page-534-4"></span><span id="page-534-0"></span>The Amorites "pressed" (or "oppressed") the tribe of Dan in the hill country. The verb used here for "pressed" is the same as that used to describe Egypt's enslavement and oppression of Israel (Ex. 3:9). It also appears several times later in Judges to describe the oppression of Israel by the surrounding nations (Judg. 2:18; 4:3; 6:9; 10:12). Although Israel's oppression is frequently the result of her idolatry, this oppression ultimately provoked repentance and a return to the Lord for deliverance. In the context of Judges the cycle of oppression and deliverance is that which occasions the Lord's raising up of judges. Eventually the Amorites succumb to forced labor under the combined house of Joseph.

<span id="page-534-14"></span><span id="page-534-13"></span><span id="page-534-11"></span><span id="page-534-10"></span>2:1 In this final section of the first introduction to Judges (vv. 1–5) the angel of the Lord "goes up" and charges Israel with breaking the covenant (vv. 1–2). The Lord disciplines his people (v. 3), and the people respond with weeping and sacrifices (vv. 4–5). The theme of "going up" that began in 1:1 continues into this final section. This time, however, it is the angel of the Lord who goes up.

<span id="page-534-17"></span><span id="page-534-16"></span><span id="page-534-9"></span><span id="page-534-8"></span><span id="page-534-6"></span><span id="page-534-5"></span>The angel of the Lord appears with some frequency in Judges. In addition to this first instance, he appears to Gideon in Judges 6 and to the parents of Samson in Judges 13. Prior to Judges the angel of the Lord appears to Hagar in Genesis 16, to Moses in the burning bush in Exodus 3, and to Balaam and his donkey in Numbers 22. The angel of the Lord also speaks from heaven to Abraham (Gen. 22:11, 15) and in the song of Deborah (Judg. 5:23). In Judges the angel of the Lord can be identified with Yahweh himself. In Judges 2:1–3 the lack of any messenger formula ("thus says the Lord") and the use of the first person ("I brought you up," "I swore," "I will never break," etc.) suggest this identification. The presence of the angel of the Lord in Judges represents God's continued care and leadership of his people, even after the deaths of two of Israel's greatest leaders, Moses and Joshua.

<span id="page-534-12"></span>Israel's failure to remove the inhabitants of the land is a violation of the covenant. As such, the angel of the Lord comes as the first judge in the book in order to engage in a covenant lawsuit. This lawsuit contains most of the standard features

of covenant lawsuits in the OT: (1) identification of the judge, (2) testimony of the innocent party, (3) indictment, (4) punishment, (5) and call to repentance. No witnesses are specified, but the name of the location that frames this passage, "Bochim," appears to serve in this capacity. In this verse the lawsuit begins with the opening lines of the Sinai covenant in Exodus 20:2, "I brought you up from Egypt," and so identifies the judge as Yahweh himself. It continues with the account of the Lord's faithfulness to his people and his pledge to keep the covenant forever.

<span id="page-535-14"></span><span id="page-535-13"></span><span id="page-535-12"></span><span id="page-535-7"></span><span id="page-535-6"></span><span id="page-535-5"></span><span id="page-535-2"></span>2:2 In this verse the covenant lawsuit continues with two specific covenant stipulations (Judg. 2:2a) and two words of indictment (2:2b). The first stipulation is the prohibition against making covenants with the inhabitants of the land—recorded, for example, in Deuteronomy 7:2: "You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them." Here we are also reminded of Israel's illicit covenant with the Gibeonites in Joshua 9. The second stipulation is the command to tear down the pagan altars in the land—once again a stipulation recorded in Deuteronomy 7: "But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and chop down their Asherim and burn their carved images with fire" (Deut. 7:5). In Deuteronomy 7 the Lord immediately explains the reasons for these commands: "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth" (Deut. 7:6). The text continues with statements of the Lord's love for Israel, his oath to the fathers, his faithfulness in keeping the covenant, and his desire to bless his people (Deut. 7:7–14). It is tragic, therefore, that Israel breaks this covenant, as the angel's words of indictment make clear: "But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?" The question that follows the statement is designed to provoke Israel to reflection and repentance.

<span id="page-535-11"></span><span id="page-535-10"></span><span id="page-535-9"></span><span id="page-535-8"></span><span id="page-535-3"></span>2:3 As a faithful covenant Lord, God must now bring upon his people the promised curses of disobedience. In this case, the curse comes from the nature of Israel's sin: their refusal to drive out all of the inhabitants from the land (Ex. 34:12; Deut. 7:16; Josh. 23:12–16). The snare of the remaining Canaanites sets the context for the upcoming judge narratives. It also reinforces that Israel's inability to expel the Canaanites is due not to a lack of military power but rather to a lack of faith to carry out the obligations of the covenant.

<span id="page-535-15"></span><span id="page-535-4"></span><span id="page-535-1"></span><span id="page-535-0"></span>2:4–5 Israel responds to God's covenant lawsuit with weeping and sacrifice, understood here as repentance and worship. To lift up one's voice and weep is a common Hebrew idiom. For example, Hagar weeps in this way for Ishmael (Gen. 21:16), Esau weeps over the loss of his blessing (Gen. 27:38), and Jacob weeps for Rachel (Gen. 29:11). The whole congregation of Israel weeps in this way at the report of the ten unfaithful spies and the seemingly negative prospect of occupying the land (Num. 14:1). This weeping also frames the book of Judges. In the second conclusion to the book Israel will weep over the virtual destruction of the tribe of Benjamin caused by its Sodomlike sin. Israel's weeping is memorialized in the naming of the city, Bochim, which "means weepers" (cf. ESV mg.). Its exact location is unknown, and it is mentioned only here in the Bible. The significance of the location, however, endures in the name. This section ends with an account of Israel's making sacrifices. The nature of the sacrifices is not specified, but they are perhaps sin offerings in the context of covenant renewal and restoration.

#### *Response*

After the death of Joshua the nation of Israel continues to spread out and occupy the land promised to her by God. In this first introduction the tribe of Judah is presented as both faithful and successful in its work of occupation. Judah is clearly the focus of this section, hinting at the establishment of the monarchy in 1 Samuel and the selection of David as king from this same tribe. The tribe of Benjamin is the foil to Judah's faithfulness. It is not able to possess its inheritance. The faithlessness of Benjamin returns in the conclusion to Judges, as it engages in the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah and suffers almost complete destruction in Judges 19–20. The contrast between these two tribes returns again in the establishment of the monarchy, as Saul is selected as Israel's first king. He is from the city of Gibeah and the tribe of Benjamin, the very place of the tragic events recorded in Judges 19. Indeed, Saul will turn out to be a king like all the other nations' (cf. 1 Sam. 8:5).

<span id="page-536-3"></span><span id="page-536-2"></span><span id="page-536-0"></span>This first introduction to Judges carefully establishes and explains the reason for Israel's relative inability to possess the Land of Promise. It is not a military problem. Although Israel may not have the best army or the most advanced weapons in the region, she does have the ultimate secret weapon. The Lord himself fights for Israel as her King and so also as the commander of her army. When the Lord marches out at the head of the host of Israel, there is only one possible outcome: victory. The inability of Israel to fully possess her inheritance stems from her disobedience to the covenant. The Lord is entirely faithful, and thus he states, "I will never break my covenant with you" (Judg. 2:1). But as for Israel it is recorded, "You have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?" (2:2). This is not an issue of political or military strength but a spiritual crisis stemming from Israel's inability to obey the terms of the covenant. This reality prepares us for the second introduction to the book, which now follows. There we will discover how God plans to overcome Israel's faithless idolatry by raising up judges who will deliver his people from the oppression of the enemy, secure the rest of the land, and promote faithfulness to the Lord and obedience to the terms of the covenant.

<span id="page-536-1"></span>At times the narratives of the Hebrew Bible can be difficult to understand. Some details make little sense in our modern context. Additionally, these narratives are concise and compact, omitting more details then they include. The accounts of Adoni-bezek and of Othniel and Achsah are two good examples. As such, when it comes to interpretation one must resist the temptation to import additional details into the narrative or to assign motives to the characters when the text is silent regarding these matters. But, as faithful interpreters of the OT, we must <span id="page-537-2"></span><span id="page-537-1"></span>ask how these narratives point to the person and work of Christ (John 5:39; Luke 24:27, 44). In the case of Othniel and Achsah, we are presented with a warrior who defeats the enemy, receives his bride as the reward for his victory, and then enters into a land of blessing and prosperity with fields and springs of water. Is this not the same picture we have in the book of Revelation, as Jesus the faithful warrior king finally purges the Enemy from the world, takes his bride, and enters into the ultimate land of blessing and prosperity, the new heavens and earth? Othniel and Achsah die, and their descendants no longer possess the land as an inheritance from the Lord. But they do possess something greater as fellow heirs with us of the eternal kingdom (Heb. 11:39–40; 12:27–29). Their job was to point us to the one who has life in himself (John 5:40)—and they are faithful witnesses.

### <span id="page-537-4"></span><span id="page-537-3"></span><span id="page-537-0"></span>JUDGES 2:6–3:6

**<sup>6</sup>**When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. **7**And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel. **<sup>8</sup>**And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years. **9**And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. **10**And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel.

**<sup>11</sup>**And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals. **12**And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the Lord to anger. **13**They abandoned the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. **<sup>14</sup>** So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies. **15**Whenever they marched out, the hand of the Lord was against them for harm, as the Lord had warned, and as the Lord had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.

**<sup>16</sup>**Then the Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. **17**Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and they did not do so. **18**Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who

afflicted and oppressed them. **19**But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways. **<sup>20</sup>** So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said, "Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice, **<sup>21</sup>** I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, **<sup>22</sup>** in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the Lord as their fathers did, or not." **<sup>23</sup>** So the Lord left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.

3 Now these are the nations that the Lord left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan. **<sup>2</sup>** It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before. **3**These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. **4**They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. **<sup>5</sup>** So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. **6**And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-538-2"></span>The first introduction to Judges (1:1–2:5) focused on Israel's relative failure to possess fully the land of her inheritance. At the end of that section the angel of the Lord characterized Israel's failure as a violation of the covenant. This violation placed Israel under the Lord's displeasure and discipline. The inhabitants whom Israel failed to expel would become the curse of her disobedience.

This second introduction to Judges focuses on the crisis of Israel's faith resulting from the snare of the Canaanites remaining in the land. We begin again with the death of Joshua and his generation. This is followed by the evil of Israel's idolatry, the subjugation of Israel by the inhabitants of the land, the raising up of judges, and the testing of Israel. Israel's theme in Judges is best captured by the statement in 2:11: "And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals."

<span id="page-538-6"></span><span id="page-538-5"></span><span id="page-538-4"></span><span id="page-538-3"></span><span id="page-538-1"></span><span id="page-538-0"></span>The arrangement of material in Judges is primarily theological, not chronological. One key feature of Hebrew narrative is the way in which the text relates an account and then returns to retell it from a different angle or focus. For example, the sixth day of creation is recounted in Genesis 1, and a longer, more focused account of that same day in given in Genesis 2. We find something similar with the anointing of David in 1 Samuel 16. At the end of the account David is loved by King Saul, working for him and serving as his armor bearer (1 Sam. 16:21). In 1 Samuel 17, however, David is unfamiliar with Saul's armor and unknown to him <span id="page-539-5"></span>(1 Sam. 17:38–39, 58). In 1 Samuel 18 the narrative returns and begins to describe David's rise to favor in the service of Saul. In the same way, this second introduction to Judges returns to the death of Joshua and provides a more focused, theological explanation of Israel's sin and its consequences.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-539-3"></span><span id="page-539-1"></span><span id="page-539-0"></span>2:6–10 The text returns to the time of Joshua and his generation, recounting events first recorded in Joshua 24:28–31. In both accounts Joshua dismisses the people to their inheritance, he dies at a good old age, the people bury him in the land of his inheritance, and Israel serves the Lord in that generation. The similarities between the two accounts are impressive. But there is one major difference, which is designed to grab our attention. In Judges 2:10 the author adds an important note regarding the next generation after Joshua: "There arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel." This characterization stands in contrast with the description of the previous generation, which had "seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel" (v. 7).

<span id="page-539-2"></span>It is true that the generations after Joshua, including ours, were not eyewitnesses to the great wonders of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, her miraculous preservation in the wilderness, and the astounding battles of occupation, but that is not the real problem. In fact, this same characterization would also apply to all who have come after the generation that witnessed the earthly life of Jesus. The real problem stems from the fact that subsequent generations failed to live by faith in light of those real and true and historical events—"for we walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Cor. 5:7). The generations recorded in Judges suffer from a form of gospel amnesia resulting in idolatry that renders them blind to the truth of God's power and faithfulness. The early statement of Gideon captures well the ethos of his generation:

<span id="page-539-6"></span>If the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, "Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?" But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian. (Judg. 6:13)

<span id="page-539-4"></span>It is the blindness caused by sin that makes us think the Lord has forsaken us when in our sin we have forsaken the Lord. This is the spiritual condition of God's people in Judges and the setting for God's ceaseless mercy as he returns over and over again to rescue and deliver his people from the subjugation of their sins.

<span id="page-540-10"></span><span id="page-540-9"></span><span id="page-540-1"></span>2:11 This is a key verse in the book, offering the primary characterization of Israel that appears at the beginning of each of the major judge narratives (3:7; 3:12; 4:1; 6:1; 10:6; 13:1). The nature of this evil is Israel's idolatry, quickly expressed in the second half of the verse ("and served the Baals"). The generation that perished in the wilderness was also characterized in this way (Num. 32:13) and the Lord repeatedly warned his people against the evil of idolatry (e.g., Deut. 4:25; 17:2; Josh. 24:15). However, without circumcised hearts Israel repeatedly falls into the snare of idolatry, which would eventually result in her exile from the land. Moses understood the situation and anticipated the outcome:

<span id="page-540-4"></span><span id="page-540-2"></span>I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you. And in the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger through the work of your hands. (Deut. 31:29)

<span id="page-540-11"></span><span id="page-540-6"></span><span id="page-540-3"></span>2:12–13 These verses focus on Israel's idolatry. Both begin in the exact same way, describing the nature of the people's idolatry: "They abandoned the Lord." The description of God as the "God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt" characterizes this sin as a violation of a covenant relationship. In this way Israel's idolatry is portrayed as an adulterous woman who has abandoned a faithful husband (cf. Hosea 1–3). Her idolatry is a transgression of the first word of the Decalogue and a continuation of Israel's worship of the golden calf. Deuteronomy repeatedly warns the people of Israel of the danger and threat of worshiping the so-called other gods of the people around them, but they fail to listen. Baal and Asherah are fertility gods that repeatedly ensnare Israel. They will appear again in the Othniel, Gideon, and Jephthah narratives. Israel's idolatry also provokes the Lord to anger, for he is a faithful covenant partner jealous for his people's holiness (Ex. 34:14; Deut. 4:24; 5:9; 6:15; 32:16, 21).

<span id="page-540-8"></span><span id="page-540-7"></span><span id="page-540-5"></span><span id="page-540-0"></span>2:14–15 Because Israel provokes the Lord's wrath with the sin of idolatry, he is now described as burning with anger against his people. Israel comes under God's curse, but it is a curse designed to provoke repentance and a return to faith. Here and throughout Judges the Lord will "give" and "sell" his people into the hands of their surrounding enemies, who then subjugate and oppress them. In other words, because Israel has sold out, the Lord sells them over into the hands of their enemies. The irony continues. The "evil" committed by Israel in Judges 2:11 is returned by the Lord in verse 15 when he turns "against them for harm." These two words, an adjective and a noun in Hebrew, share a common root and constitute an intentional wordplay. Additionally, the "hand" of the enemy prevails against God's people in verse 14 only because the "hand" of the Lord is turned against Israel as described in verse 15. The Lord warned his people that this would happen, swearing that Israel's idolatry would not go unpunished. Thus God shows himself to be faithful to his covenant promises by allowing his people to experience the weight of their sin:

<span id="page-541-5"></span><span id="page-541-4"></span><span id="page-541-3"></span>2:16 We now begin to encounter the Lord's solution to Israel's subjugation: the judges. The Lord's anger burned against his people in Judges 2:14, and his hand was against them in verse 15. But now, as quickly as his wrath has come, the Lord is moved with compassion to deliver his people, and he does so with the judges whose narratives occupy the central section of the book. The pattern is established here: it is the Lord who "raises up" the judges and the Lord who delivers through these judges. As the surrounding nations serve as the instrument of God's wrath, so the judges serve as the instrument of God deliverance.

<span id="page-541-7"></span>2:17 From the moment Israel passed through the Red Sea they struggled to obey the voice of Lord. They also rebelled against Moses, the Lord's servant and the leader of his people. In the same way, Israel will struggle to obey the voice of the judges. These judges are raised up not only to deliver God's people from their subjugation by the nations but also to promote their fidelity to the covenant in order to prevent a return idolatry and consequent oppression. But Israel's memory was short, and the pattern of sin, subjugation, and deliverance plays over and over again in Judges.

<span id="page-541-10"></span><span id="page-541-8"></span><span id="page-541-6"></span>2:18 Three important facts about the judges are set forth in this verse. First, as indicated in verse 16, it is the Lord who raises up each judge. Second, the power and authority of the judge come in the form of the Lord's presence with him. This reality is later described as the Spirit of the Lord's coming upon the judge to empower for deliverance (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6; 14:19; 15:14). Third, the Lord himself was the true agent of deliverance, with the judge serving as the instrument of God's power. This third point is also related to the second, as it is the divine presence that enables the judge to deliver. The verse concludes by explaining why the Lord raises up the judges to deliver: he has compassion and is "moved to pity" by his people's condition. The language here is reminiscent of Exodus 2:24; 6:5, in which it is recorded that God delivered Israel from Egyptian oppression because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It was the unilateral covenant with the patriarchs that moved God with compassion for his people, even as they continually violated the Mosaic covenant with their persistent idolatry.

<span id="page-541-11"></span><span id="page-541-9"></span><span id="page-541-2"></span><span id="page-541-1"></span><span id="page-541-0"></span>2:19 The cycle of Israel's idolatry is tied to the life of the judge. Upon the death of the judge, the people return to the worship of other gods. The office of the judge is not passed down from parent to child, like that of a priest or king. Rather, judges are raised up by God without any concern for succession. The text also indicates that Israel's ongoing cycles of idolatry lead her into increasing degrees of corruption. This reality is played out in Judges until the tribe of Benjamin becomes fully Canaanite, expressed in actions corresponding to those of Sodom (cf. Judges 19 with Genesis 19).

<span id="page-542-8"></span><span id="page-542-6"></span>2:20–23 The burning anger of the Lord, Israel's transgression of the covenant, the death of Joshua, and the presence of other nations appear again in these verses (cf. Judg. 2:2–3, 8, 12, 14). It is further explained in verse 22, however, that the Lord allows these nations to remain in order to "test" the obedience of his people. The accounts that follow in Judges record how Israel repeatedly fails this test. God's people fail to expel the remaining nations and so bring the land into full consecration. Rather, Israel becomes more and more like those nations, worshiping the gods of those nations and forsaking her covenantal relationship with the Lord. This tragic state of affairs is reflected in the subtle reference to God's people as "this people" (or "this nation") in verse 20. The people of God in the OT are commonly referred to as "Israel," "the people of Israel," or "my people." In this rare instance, however, they are referred to as "this people," pointing forward to its corruption as it becomes like the "nations" it failed to expel. In time, Israel will become "not my people" (Hos. 1:9).

<span id="page-542-11"></span><span id="page-542-9"></span><span id="page-542-7"></span>3:1–4 The few verses that bring the second introduction to Judges to a conclusion return to and focus on the theme of testing. Once again, the Lord leaves some of the nations to remain in the land after the death of Joshua in order to test his people with regard to their obedience to his commandments from the hand of Moses. The nature of the test focuses on war, designed for those who "had not experienced all the wars in Canaan" and so to "teach war to those who had not known it." Instruction in warfare, however, is not to be understood simply as an act of military education. The Lord uses war to test Israel's faith in him and obedience to his commands. The people are to remember that the Lord fights for Israel (Ex. 14:14), leading the army of Israel and the host of heaven (Josh. 5:13–15), and has established important laws for warfare during Israel's tenure in the land (Deut. 7:1–6; 20:1–20; 21:10–14).

<span id="page-542-10"></span><span id="page-542-5"></span><span id="page-542-3"></span><span id="page-542-2"></span>3:5–6 A prominent theme in the book's first introduction was Israel's cohabitation with the nations she was commanded to expel (Judg. 1:21, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33–36). This same theme brings the second introduction to a conclusion. These are the nations the Lord left after the death of Joshua to teach his people war, to test their obedience to his commands, and to provoke faith in their covenant-keeping God. These are also the nations whose lands the Lord promised to Abraham and his offspring (Gen. 15:18–21) and then affirmed to the nation of Israel (Ex. 3:8; cf. Ex. 3:17; 13:5; 23:23, 28; 33:2; 34:11; Num. 13:29; Deut. 7:1; 20:17).

<span id="page-542-1"></span><span id="page-542-0"></span>This section ends with a strong indictment against Israel with regard to her conduct in the land. From those nations whom the Lord prohibited, Israel took their children in marriage and their gods in worship, violating her covenant with the Lord. Deuteronomy 7:3–4 is instructive here (cf. Deut. 20:15–18):

<span id="page-542-4"></span>You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons, for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.

<span id="page-543-3"></span><span id="page-543-0"></span>This is the storyline of Judges. Descriptions of illicit marriages such as those recorded in Judges 3:6 are used in the OT to mark the climax of sinful activity and the coming of judgment. The description of the sons of God's taking the daughters of man in Genesis 6 marks the beginning of the judgment of the flood. Additionally, Solomon's taking foreign wives and his consequent idolatry in 1 Kings 11 cause the Lord to tear the kingdom from him (1 Kings 11:11). In fact, the author of 1 Kings states that "Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord" (1 Kings 11:6), the very same description applied to Israel in Judges.

#### <span id="page-543-5"></span><span id="page-543-4"></span>*Response*

This second introduction to Judges establishes the historical and theological context for the narratives of the judges that follow in the central section of the book. This section also identifies the cycle of the judge narratives that will be repeated with each of the six major judges. Israel will do that which is evil in the eyes of the Lord. This will provoke the Lord to anger, and he will give his people into the hand of their enemy. Israel will eventually repent and cry out to the Lord for help. The Lord will raise up a judge to deliver his people and secure rest for the land. Eventually, however, the judge will die and the cycle will start all over again. The subjugation and oppression of Israel by the surrounding nations is not due to the Lord's inability to protect and provide for his people. Rather, it is the Lord himself who gives over his people. Because of Israel's sin, "Whenever they marched out, the hand of the Lord was against them for harm, as the Lord had warned, and as the Lord had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress" (Judg. 2:15). But this giving over to the enemy should be understood ultimately as the Lord's kindness to his people. In each instance Israel eventually repents under the weight of her oppression and returns to the Lord. If the Lord did not discipline his people in this way, they would be wholly lost and left to remain in their sin. This is a severe mercy.

<span id="page-543-2"></span><span id="page-543-1"></span>Part of this mercy is God's using judges to deliver his people. These judges are raised up by the Lord, are sustained by his presence, and serve as the instruments of his deliverance from the enemy. They are enabled by the power of Spirit to achieve great victories. Like the victories themselves, Israel's obedience is also hard fought. Israel often fails to listen to the judge, and when the judges die the people sink into increasing levels of corruption. The author of Judges makes clear the connection between the obedience of the people and the life of the judge: "Whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers" (2:19). This begins to prepare us to look for a judge who will not die but will secure the obedience of his people forever. The judges point forward to the person and work of Christ, the one who will deliver us from the enemy, provide for our obedience, and secure our inheritance.

### <span id="page-544-1"></span>OVERVIEW OF JUDGES 3:7–16:31

The narratives of the judges occupy the central section of Judges. Six major judge cycles are divided into two groups of three. The first group comprises Othniel, Ehud, and Deborah/Barak, followed by Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson. Only one minor judge appears in the first section (Shamgar). The five remaining minor judges appear in the second: Tola and Jair appear before the Jephthah narratives, while Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon appear before the climactic Samson narratives. As the narratives progress, so does the corruption of Israel and the cost of deliverance for the judge.12

<span id="page-544-4"></span><span id="page-544-3"></span>The judges repeatedly save and deliver God's people from the oppression of the nations caused by their sin and secure their inheritance in the land. This pattern points us to the one who delivers us from the oppression of our sin, once and for all, and forever secures our inheritance of life in the new heavens and the new earth, of which the land of Canaan is a type. These narratives were written for us (1 Pet. 1:10–12) in order that we might look to Jesus and fix our eyes on him in faith as our Lord and Savior (Heb. 12:2): "Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope" (Rom. 15:4).

### <span id="page-544-2"></span><span id="page-544-0"></span>JUDGES 3:7–11

**<sup>7</sup>**And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.

Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushanrishathaim. **<sup>11</sup>** So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

#### *Section Overview*

Othniel is the first major judge in the book. His is the shortest account of a major judge, comprising only five verses, but it serves as the pattern or paradigm for all of the major judges to follow. A complete judge narrative or cycle includes seven basic components: (1) Israel does evil, (2) the Lord sells or gives his people into the hand of the enemy, (3) Israel cries out to the Lord, (4) the Lord raises up a deliverer, (5) the judge deliverers Israel, (6) the land has rest, and (7) the judge dies. Not all of the judge narratives include all seven components. In fact, as Israel's corruption progressively increases throughout the book, fewer and fewer components will appear in the individual narratives. This literary device is one of the ways in which the author of the book displays the unraveling of Israel as the people of God.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-545-2"></span>3:7 Each of the major judge accounts begins with the statement that Israel did "what was evil in the sight of the Lord." As the major judge accounts are presented in two sets of three, the accounts of Othniel and of Gideon constitute the first judge in each set and appear with the same introductory formula. The judges that follow are introduced with a slight variation: "And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord" (Judg. 3:12; 4:1; 10:6; 13:1). This literary convention helps the reader to track the larger structure of the narratives presented in the book's central section.

<span id="page-545-1"></span><span id="page-545-0"></span>The book's second introduction prepared us for this statement of Israel's conduct and for the nature of the evil committed: idolatry (2:11). Here it is recorded that Israel "served the Baals and the Asheroth" because "they forgot the Lord their God." In the OT the language of "forgetting" and "remembering" is used often with reference to covenant faithfulness, not with loss or gain of memory. For example, in Deuteronomy 4:23 God's people are warned against forgetting <span id="page-546-2"></span>the covenant by committing idolatry, and in 4:31 it is recorded that God will not forget the covenant—that is, he will always act in accordance with it. As such, to remember the covenant is to live according it. For example, God "remembered" the covenant he made with Noah and so caused the waters of the flood to subside (Gen. 8:1; cf. Gen. 9:15–16; 19:29; 30:22; Ex. 2:24; 6:5; Lev. 26:42, 45). Thus in Judges Israel does not forget about the Lord but rather fails to live faithfully in covenant with him.

<span id="page-546-8"></span><span id="page-546-7"></span><span id="page-546-4"></span><span id="page-546-0"></span>3:8 The second element of the judge cycle is God's giving or selling over of Israel into the hand of the enemy (cf. Judg. 2:14). In this instance Israel is sold into the hand of "Cushan-rishathaim" ("Cushan the double wicked"), "king of Mesopotamia" (lit., "Aram of the double river"). The period of subjugation is comparatively brief: eight years. The connection is clear between Israel's idolatry in 3:7 and her subjugation in 3:8. In her idolatry she "served" foreign gods and so in her subjugation she "served" foreign nations. This irony is intentional: the punishment suits the crime. In Hebrew this verb can be translated as either "to serve" or "to worship," depending on the relationship between the subject and the object.

<span id="page-546-9"></span><span id="page-546-1"></span>3:9 The third and fourth elements of the judge cycle appear in this verse. First, Israel cries out to the Lord in the midst of her oppression (cf. Ex. 2:23). This may be an act of repentance or simply a cry of desperation. Either way it is the context in which God moves in compassion to raise up a judge to deliver his people—the next element in the judge cycle. In this case the judge is "Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother." Very little is known about Othniel, but we do know him to be a brave and capable warrior. He appears two other times in the OT (Josh. 15:17//Judg. 1:13; cf. 1 Chron. 4:13).

<span id="page-546-12"></span><span id="page-546-10"></span><span id="page-546-5"></span><span id="page-546-3"></span>3:10 In the second introduction it was recorded that the success of the judges is connected to the enabling presence of God. "Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge" (Judg. 2:18). This enabling presence is frequently depicted as the Spirit of the Lord's coming upon the judge. In Judges the Spirit comes upon Othniel, Gideon (6:34), Jephthah (11:29), and Samson (13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14). Interestingly, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson are those judges that appear in Hebrews 11:32, alongside Barak. Deliverance by the power of the Spirit reminds us that the Lord himself saves his people. Othniel is the instrument; the Lord is the agent.

<span id="page-546-14"></span><span id="page-546-13"></span><span id="page-546-11"></span><span id="page-546-6"></span>3:11 This last verse in the Othniel narrative includes the sixth and seventh elements of the judge cycle. First, it is stated that the land had rest for forty years, a number reminiscent of Israel's wandering in the wilderness. Then it is recorded that Othniel died. This latter statement should prompt readers to remember the description in the book's second introduction: "Whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers" (2:19). It appears that the life of the judge secured the rest of the land and the faithfulness of God's people. It is, therefore, the death of one judge that moves us to look for the coming of another.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-547-4"></span><span id="page-547-3"></span><span id="page-547-1"></span><span id="page-547-0"></span>In this first judge cycle we are warned that those who "serve" other gods come under the oppression of those gods and "serve" those who have created such false gods (3:7–8). "Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them" (Ps. 115:8). But the Lord's anger with his people is short lived. He hears their cry for help and moves out to deliver his people by the power of his Spirit, raising up judges to rescue them from oppression. The land's rest and the people's faithfulness are tied to the life of the judge. Perhaps this is what provokes Israel to ask for a king, so that an ongoing succession of leadership would sustain the land's rest and the people's obedience, as intended by the kingship described in Deuteronomy 17:14–20. But we will soon discover that human kingship as recorded in 1–2 Kings can sustain neither the land's rest nor the people's obedience. If only there were a faithful judge who lives forever and thus could ensure both our rest and our faithfulness. "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing" (2 Tim. 4:8).

**<sup>12</sup>**And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the Lord. **<sup>13</sup>** He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms. **14**And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.

**<sup>15</sup>**Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a lefthanded man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. **16**And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit*<sup>1</sup>* in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. **17**And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. **18**And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. **19**But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded, "Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence. **<sup>20</sup>**And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat. **21**And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. **22**And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out. **23**Then Ehud went out into the porch*<sup>2</sup>* and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them.

**<sup>24</sup>**When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber." **25**And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.

**<sup>26</sup>**Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. **27**When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader. **28**And he said to them, "Follow after me, for the Lord has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over. **29**And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. **<sup>30</sup>** So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.

**31**After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-548-3"></span>The account of Ehud includes all seven elements of the judge cycle identified in the Othniel narrative. The report of his death, however, does not appear until Judges 4:1, the opening verse of the Deborah and Barak narrative. Only these first two judge accounts employ all seven formulaic elements. The account of Ehud is filled with humor, irony, wordplay, and graphic scenes of deliverance. If these events were to be depicted on television or film, they would certainly come with a strong parental warning.

<span id="page-548-2"></span><span id="page-548-1"></span><span id="page-548-0"></span>The Ehud account comprises four sections. In the first, Moab subdues Israel (3:12–14). This situation is reversed in the fourth section, as Israel subdues Moab (vv. 27–30). The two central sections contain the account of the Lord's raising up of Ehud (v. 15) and Ehud's assassination of Eglon (vv. 16–26). The account of this assassination occupies eleven of the nineteen verses in this judge cycle—it is the clear focus of the author.

#### *Section Outline*

- d. Moab Subdued by Israel (3:27–30)
- II.A.3. Shamgar (3:31; minor)

#### *Comment*

3:12 The account of Ehud opens with the standard statement of Israel's doing evil in the sight of the Lord. The nature of the evil is not identified, but the statement appears twice in this verse in order to highlight the Lord's just punishment of Israel. Moab is able to prevail against Israel only because the Lord strengthens Eglon to do so, for Israel has done "what was evil." In the accounts of the judges the Lord himself is the primary agent of activity. It is the Lord who strengthens Eglon (v. 12), it is the Lord who raises up a deliverer (v. 15), and it is the Lord who gives the Moabites into the hand of the Israelites.

<span id="page-549-10"></span><span id="page-549-6"></span><span id="page-549-1"></span>3:13–14 Eglon, the king of Moab, joins forces with the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and together they capture the "city of palms," Jericho (cf. Deut. 34:3; 2 Chron. 28:15). The capture of this city is strategic because of its proximity to the Jordan and thus easy passage into Moab and Ammon east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea.13 Moab's oppression of Israel lasts eighteen years before Israel cries out to the Lord for help. During this time it is said that "Israel served Eglon." This statement serves as a subtle condemnation of Israel that is lost in translation. The name "Eglon" is a combination of the Hebrew for "calf" plus a diminutive ending: "little calf."14 And the Hebrew verb translated as "serve" can also be rendered "worship" (cf. comment on 3:8). This subtle wordplay means the statement could be rendered "Israel worshiped the little calf," a likely allusion to Israel's worship of the golden calf in Exodus 32 and thus also the nature of Israel's evil, which was omitted in Judges 3:12.

<span id="page-549-7"></span><span id="page-549-5"></span><span id="page-549-4"></span><span id="page-549-3"></span><span id="page-549-0"></span>3:15 The text now records Israel's cry for help and the Lord's response. Once again the Lord "raised up" a "deliverer" (or "savior") to rescue his people from oppression (cf. 2:16). The characterization of a judge as someone raised up by God to save or deliver his people casts him as a type of Christ, the one raised by the Father to deliver his people fully and finally.

<span id="page-549-2"></span>The text provides three important details about Ehud. First, he is a Benjaminite, the son of Gera. In the presentation of the tribes in Judges 1, Judah is mentioned first and Benjamin second. Following this pattern, the first judge is from Judah and now the second is from Benjamin. Next, it is recorded that Ehud is "left-handed" (lit., "bound in the right hand"). The exact nature of this description is debated. It could be that he is crippled in the right hand and so forced to use his left hand, or perhaps he has trained himself to use his left hand as an advantage in warfare. This same expression occurs in 20:16, in which the Benjaminites have "700 chosen men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss" (cf. 1 Chron. 12:2). As such it appears that Ehud is a specially trained warrior, and this detail prepares us for the way in which he will assassinate Eglon. Finally, we are told that part of Israel's subjugation by Moab requires tribute from Israel, which Ehud is assigned to deliver. This will provide the occasion for his defeat of Eglon.

<span id="page-549-9"></span><span id="page-549-8"></span><sup>13</sup> Cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 112.

<span id="page-550-2"></span>3:16–17 The narrator provides two additional details to prepare us for the events about to unfold. Ehud makes for himself a concealed weapon, a small sword with "two edges" that he hides under his clothes on his right thigh. This location provided ready access for a left-handed warrior. The expression "two edges" is "two mouths" in Hebrew, perhaps for the devouring of its victim, a humorous description in light of Eglon's characterization as a "very fat man." The little calf of Israel's oppression (cf. comment on 3:13–14) has become the fattened calf ready for slaughter. Soon Ehud's sword will be lost in Eglon's fat (v. 22).

<span id="page-550-13"></span><span id="page-550-3"></span><span id="page-550-0"></span>3:18–20 The scene is quickly set for Ehud's private assassination of Eglon. After Ehud delivers the tribute, he dismisses his assistants and returns to the king with a "secret message," his own personal "message from God." In this case the word of the Lord is literally a sharp, two-edged sword (cf. Heb. 4:12). However, this sword will pierce not soul and spirit but rather flesh and fat. The king also dismisses his attendants, and the two men stand alone in the king's "cool roof [upper] chamber." This will be a different type of "upper room experience" for Eglon. Judges 3:20 concludes with the king's rising from the throne, leaving readers with anticipation of what will follow. The irony continues. In verse 15 the Lord raised up Ehud to deliver Israel. Now here in verses 20 Eglon raises himself up (same verb in Hebrew) for deliverance to begin.

<span id="page-550-5"></span><span id="page-550-4"></span><span id="page-550-1"></span>3:21 The account of the execution of Eglon is filled with graphic detail. Ehud's training as a left-handed warrior catches the king off guard, and the once-concealed sword is thrust into the belly of Eglon. The word translated "thrust" appears with some frequency in Judges. When used with a weapon it means "to thrust," but when used with a horn or trumpet this same verb means "to blow, sound." So, for example, in verse 21 Ehud "thrusts" the sword, but in verse 27 Ehud "sounded" the trumpet. Jael thrusts a tent peg through the head of Sisera (4:21), and Delilah thrusts Samson's hair into the peg of a loom (16:14). In each instance this verb is used to describe the subjugation or defeat of an opponent.

<span id="page-550-12"></span><span id="page-550-11"></span><span id="page-550-10"></span><span id="page-550-9"></span><span id="page-550-7"></span>3:22–23 Eglon is large, while the sword is small. This sword is the last thing this fat king consumes. The fat of the robust king envelopes the sword, and Ehud does not remove it. The Hebrew word for the "blade" of the sword is also the word for "flame," appearing again in 13:20 when "the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar." Since Eglon is characterized as the fattened calf ready for sacrifice, the use of the word "flame" for the blade of the sword appears to be intentional wordplay.

<span id="page-550-8"></span><span id="page-550-6"></span>The end of 3:22 is shocking: "and the dung came out." The exact meaning of the word for "dung" is uncertain; it could also mean something like "bowels" or "entrails." Since this noun appears only here in the Hebrew Bible, it is difficult to determine its exact meaning with certainty. However, since the king's attendants suspect he is using the privy behind the locked doors (v. 24), the interpretation "dung" or "excrement" well suits the context.

<span id="page-551-4"></span><span id="page-551-3"></span>Verses 22–23 are linked by repetition of words and sounds. At the end of verse 22 the dung "came out" of Eglon, and in verse 23 Ehud "went out" from the room. Additionally, the word for "porch" looks and sounds like that for "dung" in the previous verse. The exact meaning of this word is also unknown, but it appears to refer to an architectural feature of the room. The closing, and locking, of the doors gives Ehud time to escape and sets the scene for what follows.

<span id="page-551-8"></span><span id="page-551-5"></span>3:24–26 The discovery of the dead king is somewhat comical. The king's servants wait behind locked doors, thinking that he is relieving himself (lit., "covering his feet"; cf. 1 Sam. 24:3), either because of the smell emanating from the room or because this is the regular practice of the overweight king. The servants wait to unlock the doors until they are embarrassed by the delay; this is what gives Ehud the time needed to escape.

<span id="page-551-9"></span><span id="page-551-6"></span><span id="page-551-1"></span>3:27–30 In Judges 3:12–14 Moab subdued Israel because the Lord had "strengthened" Eglon against Israel. Now Israel will subdue Moab because the Lord "has given" Moab into the hand of Israel. This recognition of divine agency promotes the truth of God's sovereignty over the events of history (Isa. 43:11–13). The Lord allowed Moab to oppress Israel because of her sin. This oppression provoked Israel to cry out to the Lord in repentance. It is the Lord's kindness to discipline those he loves so that they might continue in faith and faithfulness to the covenant (Heb. 12:6).

<span id="page-551-10"></span>Upon escape Ehud summons the Ephraimites, and together they defeat the Moabites. By seizing the fords of the Jordan, Israel prevents the Moabites from crossing back into Moab and prevents additional Moabite forces from coming to their assistance. The fords of the Jordan appear will again in Judges with the accounts of Gideon and Jephthah.

<span id="page-551-2"></span>The victory over Moab is complete. Ten thousand perish in battle; not a single Moabite escapes. The description of the Moabite warriors is telling: they are "all strong, able-bodied men" (or "all fat and all men of war"). This description of the warriors correlates with the earlier description of Eglon as "very fat" (Judg. 3:17). For eighteen years Moab had oppressed Israel and grown fat (literally!) on Israel's tribute. The warriors of Moab not only looked like their king but also shared his same fate. The victory over Moab inaugurates a period of rest for the land that lasts eighty years, twice that experienced under Othniel.

<span id="page-551-7"></span><span id="page-551-0"></span>3:31 Shamgar is the first minor judge in the book. The account is written with reference to Ehud ("After him"), but it also serves to introduce the Deborah and Barak narratives that immediately follow. We only know the name of the judge's father, the fact that he kills six hundred Philistines with an "oxgoad" (a long stick with something like a nail or spike at its tip), and that he "saved" Israel. He is not associated with any tribe; his name means "sojourner there," similar (in reverse) to the name of the son of Moses, "Gershom, for he said, 'I have been a sojourner in a foreign land'" (Ex. 2:22). The inclusion of the six minor judges in Judges gives us twelve total judges, no doubt representing the twelve tribes of Israel and God's care for the whole of his people.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-552-0"></span>The account of Ehud and Eglon, Israel and Moab, is a literary masterpiece with memorable detail, wordplay, and innuendo. Here we encounter the seriousness of Israel's sin as she returns to the worship of a fattened calf, recalling her worship of the golden calf in Exodus 32. We also encounter God's grace and mercy to his people. The Lord does not leave Israel in her sin but allows the people to suffer the consequences of that sin under Moabite oppression in order to provoke repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness. When his people cry out, the Lord moves with compassion for his people and raises up a savior to deliver them. The Lord himself is the hero of the story. He strengthens Eglon to punish Israel. He raises up a savior to deliver his people. He gives the enemy over into the hand of his people. In spite of Israel's recurring unfaithfulness, the Lord is always working to bring his people back to himself. Psalm 107:21–22 teaches God's people how to respond to his miraculous deliverance:

<span id="page-552-2"></span> Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man! And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy! (Ps. 107:21–22)

4 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord after Ehud died. **2**And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. **3**Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.

**<sup>4</sup>**Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. **<sup>5</sup>** She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment. **<sup>6</sup>** She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, "Has not the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded you, 'Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun. **7**And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand'?" **8**Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go." **9**And she said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. **10**And Barak called out

Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.

**<sup>11</sup>**Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.

**<sup>12</sup>**When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, **<sup>13</sup>** Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. **14**And Deborah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the Lord go out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him. **15**And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. **16**And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.

**<sup>17</sup>**But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. **18**And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. **19**And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. **20**And he said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.' " **21**But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died. **22**And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.

**<sup>23</sup>** So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel. **24**And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

5 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day:

- **<sup>2</sup>** "That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the Lord!
- **<sup>3</sup>** "Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; to the Lord I will sing; I will make melody to the Lord, the God of Israel.
- **<sup>4</sup>** "Lord, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water.
- **<sup>5</sup>** The mountains quaked before the Lord, even Sinai before the Lord, *1* the God of Israel.
- **<sup>6</sup>** "In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned, and travelers kept to the byways.
- **<sup>7</sup>** The villagers ceased in Israel; they ceased to be until I arose; I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel.
- **<sup>8</sup>** When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates. Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?

"Then down to the gates marched the people of the Lord.

- **<sup>12</sup>** "Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, break out in a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam.

#### *Section Overview*

The account of Deborah and Barak constitutes the third major judge cycle and the climax of the first panel of judges presented in Judges (cf. Introduction for discussion of book's structure). Its climactic status is highlighted by doubling. We see two leaders (Deborah and Barak) and two opponents (Jabin and Sisera). The narrative features two women (Deborah and Jael) and two summoned tribes (Zebulun and Naphtali). The victory of Barak over the army is coupled with the victory of Jael over Sisera. Finally, the text itself features two accounts of the Lord's deliverance: the narrative account in chapter 4 is followed by a poetic account in chapter 5.

<span id="page-556-1"></span><span id="page-556-0"></span>The song of victory in Judges 5 recalls the song of victory in Exodus 15 following the Lord's defeat of Egypt. In fact, the deliverance in Judges 4–5 is patterned after the exodus event in Exodus 14–15. As with the accounts of Othniel and Ehud, this account also begins with Israel's sin and subjugation, but it ends with the subjugation of the enemy after Israel repents and cries out to the Lord. In terms of the seven basic elements of the judge cycles, some scholars have observed that the Deborah and Barak account lacks the statement that the Lord raised up a judge and that the Lord gave the enemy into the hand of the judge. However, these elements do in fact appear, but in modified form. In the judgment delivered by Deborah in Judges 4:6–7, the Lord selects Barak to lead his people and then assures Barak that he will indeed give the enemy "into his hand." The one element that is missing is the report of the death of the judge at the end of the account.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-557-7"></span><span id="page-557-3"></span>4:1 The opening formula in 4:1 is identical to that in 3:12, the beginning of the Ehud narrative. This connection with the Ehud narrative is further strengthened by the reference to his death at the end of the verse and contributes to the wellcrafted design of the whole book. The exact nature of the evil committed by Israel is not stated, but the book's second introduction indicates idolatry: "They abandoned the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth" (2:13).

<span id="page-557-8"></span><span id="page-557-6"></span><span id="page-557-5"></span>4:2–3 Among the first three major judge cycles, the duration of foreign oppression increases from eight (3:8) to eighteen years (3:14) and now to twenty. Because Israel has sold out for the Canaanites, the Lord now sells his people into the hands of those nations whose gods after which they have whored, in order to provoke their repentance. This time the Lord gives them over to Jabin, king of Canaan, and Sisera, commander of his army. Jabin reigns from Hazor, while Sisera lives in Harosheth-hagoyim.15 Later the locations of Deborah and Barak are also included in the narrative, together serving to root these events in real space and time. These are not imaginary stories, myths, or legends but true accounts of the Lord and his people played out across the history of redemption.

<span id="page-557-4"></span>As Israel's evil is severe, so also is her oppression. With nine hundred chariots of iron Jabin and Sisera possess the military strength to dominate the region. It is this incredible strength that causes Israel to cry out to the Lord for help. The military advantage of iron chariots over Israel was first encountered in chapter 1: "The Lord was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron" (1:19). The Lord is now ready to display his glory and power in the miraculous destruction of this army of iron chariots. This threat and these events recall God's deliverance from the chariots of Pharaoh in Exodus 14–15, when Pharaoh "took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them" (Ex. 14:7).

<span id="page-557-9"></span><span id="page-557-1"></span><span id="page-557-0"></span>4:4 As do a few other books in the OT, Judges highlights and portrays the significant role of women in Israel's recorded history. In this book Achsah, Deborah, Jael, the woman who crushes the head of Abimelech, and the mother of Samson are portrayed positively, while Samson's Timnite bride and Delilah are portrayed negatively. Deborah is both a prophetess and a judge. Unlike the other judges in the book, Deborah's leadership is oracular and perhaps judicial, but not military. Her role as prophetess serves as yet another link to the events of the exodus, echoing the role of Miriam, sister of Moses and Aaron (Ex. 15:20). In addition to

<span id="page-557-2"></span><sup>15</sup> For the location of the events in Judges 4 cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 111, map 4.18.

<span id="page-558-11"></span><span id="page-558-10"></span>Miriam and Deborah, Huldah (2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chron. 34:22), Noadiah (a negative example; Neh. 6:14), and the wife of Isaiah (Isa. 8:3) appear with the same title in the OT.

<span id="page-558-3"></span>4:5 Deborah would sit under the palm of Deborah while "the people of Israel came up to her for [the] judgment." The Israelites "come up" to Deborah not for legal advice but for the word of the Lord delivered through her as a prophetess. This specific judgment is the identification of Barak in the next verse as the one who will go up and lead the army of Israel. The language of this verse is reminiscent of 1:1, in which the people of Israel inquired of the Lord as to who should go up and lead in battle against the Canaanites. In Judges 1 the word of the Lord was that the tribe of Judah would go. Now here it is the individual Barak who will lead the people of God into battle, and that word is delivered by Deborah.

<span id="page-558-0"></span>4:6–7 The selection of Barak is confirmed by the prophetic word recorded in these verses. Barak is from the tribe of Naphtali, and he serves as a judge in the tradition of Othniel and Ehud. His name appears alongside Gideon, Samson, and Jephthah in Hebrews 11:32 (cf. 1 Sam. 12:11).

<span id="page-558-9"></span><span id="page-558-5"></span>The interrogative nature of the word of the Lord in Judges 4:6–7 is rhetorical—the "Has not" could also be translated "Indeed." This way of speaking emphasizes the certainty of the word of the Lord; it is not a question regarding Barak's knowledge of that word. This same literary device is employed again in verse 14.

<span id="page-558-6"></span><span id="page-558-4"></span><span id="page-558-2"></span><span id="page-558-1"></span>The word of the Lord comes in two parts. First are the instructions for Barak in verse 6. He must "gather" (or "draw out") to Mount Tabor ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun. The number of men here is identical to number of Moabite men killed by Ehud in the previous cycle (3:29). The second part of the word of the Lord begins in 4:7, as the Lord assures Barak of victory in battle. It is the Lord who will "draw out" Sisera and his army and give them over into the hand of Barak and his troops. From a human perspective, the odds are stacked against Israel. Sisera has his nine hundred iron chariots and his "troops" (or "multitude"). Barak has a prophetess and only ten thousand men from two of the lesser tribes of Israel. This setup is intentional: as with Israel's victory at the Red Sea or Gideon's victory to come, the Lord is teaching an important lesson. "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God" (Ps. 20:7; cf. Isa. 31:1).

<span id="page-558-12"></span><span id="page-558-8"></span><span id="page-558-7"></span>4:8–9 Barak's request that Deborah go with him into battle should not to be understood as a lack of faith or as cowardice.16 Rather it is an expression of dependence on the word of the Lord entrusted to Deborah. Later it will be Deborah's word as a prophetess that begins the battle with Sisera (Judges 4:14). The first part of her quick reply, "I will surely go with you," affirms the positive nature of Barak's request. The second part of Deborah's reply is also prophetic in nature. It hints at the victory of Jael over Sisera that will occupy a major portion of the upcoming battle narrative. Barak is also to be commended for his willingness to lead in a battle that will not lead to his "glory" (or "fame"17). Barak's request for Deborah to lead with him, along with his willingness to yield the fame of the battle to a woman, is an expression of humility and faith, not a lack of such faith. Barak is one of those "who through faith conquered kingdoms" (Heb. 11:33).

<span id="page-559-13"></span><span id="page-559-4"></span>4:10 In Judges 4:3 the people of Israel cried out to the Lord. Now here Barak cries out ("called out"; same verb in Hebrew) to his fellow Israelites. This verse records his obedience to the word of the Lord in the summoning of ten thousand warriors from Zebulun and Naphtali. The text also restates that "Deborah went up with him," continuing the theme of "going up" so prominent in the book's first introduction (cf. comment on 1:1).

<span id="page-559-8"></span><span id="page-559-3"></span><span id="page-559-2"></span>4:11 This verse briefly intrudes on the flow of the narrative (similar to 1:16), providing important background information regarding the Kenites that will set the scene for upcoming events. In 1:16 it was recorded that the Kenites, the family of Moses' wife, settled with the tribe of Judah in "the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad." Now we learn that one member of that clan, Heber, resettled near Kedesh, in the vicinity of the battle with Sisera. Heber is the husband of Jael, the woman who will achieve the fame and glory mentioned in 4:9 (cf. 5:24).

<span id="page-559-9"></span><span id="page-559-7"></span><span id="page-559-6"></span>4:12–13 The battle scene is set. Barak has "gone up" on Mount Tabor, while Sisera is down at the Kishon River. Barak has the strategic high ground when Sisera "called out" (same verb as in vv. 3, 10) for his iron chariots and army. The location of the chariots by the Kishon will play a major role in the upcoming defeat of the Canaanites.

<span id="page-559-12"></span><span id="page-559-10"></span><span id="page-559-5"></span>4:14 Deborah sets the battle in motion with the prophetic word that the day of the victory of the Lord is at hand (cf. Ps. 118:24; "This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it."). Her prophetic word includes two important parts. First, it is stated that the Lord "has given" (past tense) Sisera and his army into Barak's hand; that is, the final outcome of the battle is certain. Second, the reason for this certainty is because the Lord himself "goes out" (past tense in Hb.) before Barak against Sisera and his iron-chariot army. As in Judges 4:6, the question here is rhetorical and so could also be translated as an emphatic statement of fact: "Indeed, the Lord has gone out before you!" The order of the march has the Lord in the lead, followed by Barak and then his ten thousand warriors. The Lord is a warrior who goes out to lead in battle on behalf of his people (Ex. 15:3). This single fact explains Israel's victory.

<span id="page-559-11"></span><span id="page-559-1"></span><span id="page-559-0"></span>4:15 In the presence of Barak and his army, the Lord "routed Sisera" and his iron chariots. The word translated "routed" means "to throw into confusion or panic." This verb is used in Exodus 14:24 when the Lord "threw the Egyptian forces into a panic," serving as another point of connection between the Lord's deliverance J udges 4:1–5:31 560

<span id="page-560-10"></span><span id="page-560-9"></span><span id="page-560-0"></span>of his people at the Red Sea and his deliverance here at the Kishon River. When the Lord reveals himself to the enemies of his people, they are overwhelmed and thrown into confusion and great panic (cf. Ex. 23:27; Deut. 2:15; Josh. 10:10; 1 Sam. 7:10; 2 Sam. 22:15; Pss. 18:14; 144:6). In the subsequent poetic account of the victory, further details of the battle are provided: the Lord has gone out in cosmic terrifying theophany (Judg. 5:4–5), and the waters of the Kishon have washed away the army and chariots of Sisera, again replaying the events of the exodus. The halting of the iron chariots in the torrential waters of the Kishon also explains why Sisera exits his chariot and flees on foot. In flooding waters, heavy iron chariots become a liability, and this allows Israel to prevail over a much more powerful military force.

<span id="page-560-5"></span><span id="page-560-3"></span>4:16 The enemy having been routed by the Lord, Barak and his troops deal with the remains of Sisera's forces by putting to death every last warrior. As with Ehud and the Moabites, the account again describes the complete defeat of the enemy: "Not a man was left" (cf. 3:29). The irony of Barak and his troops' pursuing with swords Sisera and his chariots is clear. This would be like a cavalry regiment's defeating armored tanks. Armored tanks defeat horses and chariots defeat swords—unless the Lord is leading in battle, which is the recurring point of the narrative.

<span id="page-560-6"></span><span id="page-560-2"></span><span id="page-560-1"></span>4:17 In verse 16 Barak "pursued the chariots." Now in verse 17 Sisera "fled away on foot." Both verses begin with disjunctive clauses that mark an important contrast and turning point in the narrative. Here begins the account of Sisera's shameful defeat. We are also introduced finally to Jael, the woman at whom the author of Judges has been hinting since chapter 1 via the enigmatic mention of the Kenites in 1:16 and again in 4:11. These references to the Kenites, along with Deborah's prophetic statement that "the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman" (v. 9), highlight the significance of the events that follow. In fact, Jael's execution of Sisera is the focus of the narrative, spanning seven verses filled with memorable details.

<span id="page-560-7"></span><span id="page-560-4"></span>4:18 Jael takes the initiative. She goes out to meet Sisera, invites him into her tent, hides him under a rug, and speaks words of peace ("Do not be afraid"). Sisera accepts her invitation because of the peaceful relationship between Jabin and Heber indicated in the previous verse. Here, Sisera is characterized as a coward. The commander of an iron chariot army abandons his troops and hides under a rug in the tent of a woman.

<span id="page-560-8"></span>4:19–20 Sisera makes two requests of Jael. First he asks her to give him something to drink. Then he asks her to lie to anyone who might come looking for him. Commentators have questioned why Jael gives Sisera milk instead of water. Is this generosity, trickery, or some other convention lost to us over time? Perhaps the author is subtly revealing that Jael does not comply with either of Sisera's requests. She does not give him water to drink, and she actively goes out to Barak to disclose Sisera's location. Jael will prevail over Sisera with her cunning and strength.

<span id="page-561-7"></span><span id="page-561-4"></span>4:21–22 As with the death of Eglon in the previous account, the death of Sisera is described with careful detail. Jael's weapons are the common tools of a tentdwelling people, a hammer and a tent peg. Here the general of the Canaanite army is defeated by a woman in her tent, as the prophetic word of Deborah is fulfilled in real space and time. The Lord has indeed sold Sisera "into the hand of a woman" (4:9)! Later in Judges an unnamed woman will crush the head of Abimelech, a death characterized as shameful for warriors (9:53–54). The gruesome nature of these deaths points us back to Genesis 3:15, in which God promises that he will one day crush the head of the Serpent and achieve final victory for his people. Even the name Sisera sounds like the hissing of a serpent. With these events we are reminded of God's enduring faithfulness to carry out his plan of redemption.

<span id="page-561-16"></span><span id="page-561-15"></span><span id="page-561-8"></span><span id="page-561-0"></span>4:23–24 These verses bring the narrative account of this judge cycle to a near conclusion. The final statement of the narrative is delayed until after the song of victory: "And the land had rest for forty years" (Judg. 5:31b). We are reminded again that the Lord is the true hero of the story. Just as he sold Israel into the hand of Jabin in 4:2, so also the Lord has subdued Jabin before his people. As a just judge, the Lord allows his people to experience the curse of their sin. But as a merciful covenant King the Lord comes to the rescue of his people when they cry for help.

<span id="page-561-5"></span><span id="page-561-3"></span><span id="page-561-2"></span><span id="page-561-1"></span>5:1 The mention of Deborah and Barak clearly links the song of victory in chapter 5 with the events recorded in chapter 4. The "that day" of this verse is tied to "this is the day" in 4:14. Additionally, the combination of the Lord's great deliverance followed by a song of victory parallels Exodus 14–15. This link is designed to remind readers that the God who delivered his people from Egypt is the same God who delivers his people today, for he is "the same yesterday and today and forever" (Heb. 13:8). Furthermore, the songs of Exodus 15 and Judges 5 do not simply memorialize the Lord's victory in battle; they also establish the theological significance of the events by identifying patterns of redemption.

<span id="page-561-17"></span><span id="page-561-14"></span><span id="page-561-11"></span><span id="page-561-9"></span>5:2–3 The song begins with a call to worship: "Bless the Lord!" In recognition of God's great deliverance in battle, credit is first given where credit is due. This same command appears again in verse 9 and with some frequency in the Psalms (e.g., Pss. 103:20–22; 134:1–2; 135:19–20). This call to worship invokes those who led in battle and those who volunteered to fight. This song is also designed to serve as a public and lasting testimony to God's great deliverance, and so it is placed before kings and princes. The combination of the plural Hebrew verb translated "bless" and the first-person verbs translated "I will sing" and "I will make melody" establishes the communal nature of this song. In other words, the statement in Judges 5:1 that Deborah and Barak sang this song likely means that they led the community in worship. Some portions of the song are placed in the mouth of Deborah (vv. 6–11), while other are addressed to her (v. 12).

<span id="page-561-13"></span><span id="page-561-12"></span><span id="page-561-10"></span><span id="page-561-6"></span>5:4–5 In 4:15–16 it was recorded that the Lord went out before the army of Israel and routed Sisera and his iron chariots. Now in this poetic account we learn that J udges 4:1–5:31 562

<span id="page-562-13"></span><span id="page-562-7"></span><span id="page-562-5"></span><span id="page-562-0"></span>the Lord did so in the manner of a great storm theophany.18 The unsettling of the natural elements is likened to the storm theophany that settled on Mount Sinai in Exodus 19 (cf. Ex. 19:16–20; 20:18; Deut. 4:11). The Hebrew text rendered "even Sinai" in Judges 5:5 could also be rendered "this is Sinai" or "the One of Sinai," strengthening the author's connection of the events of Judges 4 to those of the exodus (cf. Ps. 68:8 for the same construction translated "the One of Sinai" in a similar context). It was this awesome display of God's presence that threw the enemy into great panic and enabled Israel to prevail. Later the song provides additional details regarding the nature of the battle that highlight the cosmic power of God to fight from heaven for his people (Judg. 5:20–21).

<span id="page-562-11"></span><span id="page-562-8"></span><span id="page-562-4"></span>5:6–8 These verses describe the social conditions in the days of Deborah that precipitated Israel's crying out to the Lord for deliverance. The oppression of Jabin and Sisera paralyzed Israel's infrastructure and prohibited the flourishing of travel and trade. The reason for this is clear: "When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates." It was Israel's idolatry, her abandonment of the Lord, that corrupted the land and allowed for this oppression to threaten the people's lives. Israel was ill equipped to handle this threat. Sisera had nine hundred iron chariots, but Israel did not even have a shield or spear "among forty thousand in Israel." This also explain why Shamgar fought with an oxgoad (3:31) and Ehud had to make himself a sword (3:16). This time the Lord came to the aid of Israel by raising up a mother for Israel who would deliver the word of the Lord and attend to the defeat of the enemy. The Lord always works in a way that highlights his ability to display his power through what seems to be human weakness (1 Cor. 1:27). The reference to Shamgar suggests that he may have been a contemporary of Deborah, while the reference to Jael highlights her important role in the victory (Judg. 4:17–21) and its retelling (5:24–27).

<span id="page-562-15"></span><span id="page-562-12"></span><span id="page-562-9"></span><span id="page-562-6"></span><span id="page-562-3"></span><span id="page-562-1"></span>5:9–11 This next section of the song commends both the leaders and the villagers who volunteered to assemble and fight alongside of the Lord. Together they bless the Lord by recounting his "righteous triumphs" in battle. His great deeds are to be proclaimed throughout Israel by those who sit on donkeys and those who walk on the way (rich and poor), at the watering places and the city gates. Declarations of this type recall the important instruction of Deuteronomy 6:7: "You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise." Israel committed idolatry in the days of Othniel because the people "forgot the Lord their God" (Judg. 3:7). The remedy to the idolatry of forgetting is the faithfulness of remembering the "wondrous things" (Ps. 119:18) the Lord has done for his people.

<span id="page-562-14"></span><span id="page-562-10"></span><span id="page-562-2"></span>5:12 The community extols Deborah and Barak to continue in song as they lead away the captives. These cannot be the captives of the army, since no Canaanite

<sup>18</sup> Cf. Jeffrey J. Niehaus, *God at Sinai: Covenant and Theophany in the Bible and Ancient Near East* (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1995), 281–282; Vern S. Poythress, *Theophany: A Biblical Theology of God's Appearing* (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2018), 286–287.

<span id="page-563-8"></span><span id="page-563-7"></span>warriors survived (Judg. 4:16). These must be the spoils of the Canaanite cities, subjugated in service to Israel. The mention of Deborah and Barak recalls 5:1 and serves to introduce a new section of the song.

<span id="page-563-9"></span><span id="page-563-5"></span>5:13–18 In 4:6 the Lord commanded Barak through Deborah to assemble ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun. This section of the song expands on Barak's call to arms and includes the responses of some of the other tribes. There is no contradiction between the narrative and poetic accounts. Rather, the second account expands and interprets the previous account from a different perspective, a common literary technique in the OT (e.g., the two accounts of day six of creation in Genesis 1–2). In this poetic account of the assembly of Israel's army, warriors from Ephraim, Benjamin, Zebulun, Naphtali, and Issachar are characterized as "faithful to Barak" (Judg. 5:15). By way of contrast, those from the tribes of Reuben, Gilead (a region spanning parts of Gad and Manasseh east of the Jordan), Dan, and Asher did not attend to Barak's call to fight with the Lord against the Canaanites.

<span id="page-563-10"></span><span id="page-563-0"></span>The important theme of tribal fidelity recalls the opening verses of the book, in which Judah and Simeon fought together with great success. It also recalls the occupation of the land recorded in Joshua, as the Transjordan tribes fought as one with their brothers in the possession of the land west of the Jordan. Accounts such as these stress the importance of the unity of the people of God, in both the OT and the NT. It was the tragic division of Israel into northern and southern kingdoms that marked the beginning of the exile of God's people from the land.

This section of the song ends with a final reference to Zebulun and Naphtali, praising their willingness to risk their lives in battle—again taking us back to 4:6. The reason for the focus on these two tribes to the exclusion of the others is unknown. Perhaps they led in battle immediately behind the Lord and Barak, or perhaps their mustering of ten thousand men from two of the smaller tribes exemplified widespread faithfulness on their part. We do know, however, that these two tribes took up arms for the Lord in the spirit of the Levites in Exodus 32 ("Who is on the Lord's side? Come to me"; Ex. 32:26), and they are forever remembered for it.

<span id="page-563-11"></span><span id="page-563-6"></span><span id="page-563-4"></span><span id="page-563-3"></span><span id="page-563-2"></span><span id="page-563-1"></span>5:19 This next section of the song, extending through verse 23, returns to the description of the battle. In verses 4–5 of this chapter the song describes the coming of the Lord as a great storm theophany, in the tradition of Sinai. Now in these verses the manner in which the Lord "routed" (4:15) the army of Sisera is poetically portrayed. This verse describes the army of the enemy as comprising the "kings of Canaan." In chapter 4 only one king is named: Jabin. But here we are told of the broader forces employed by Jabin. In Joshua 11:10 the city of Hazor is described as something of a Canaanite capital city, "the head of all those kingdoms." Since Jabin reigned from Hazor, we can assume that he rallied troops from his allies in opposition to Israel—a common practice. The inability of the enemy forces to overcome the people of God is poetically portrayed in their inability to take the spoils of war: "They got no spoils of silver."

J udges 4:1–5:31 564

<span id="page-564-15"></span><span id="page-564-8"></span><span id="page-564-3"></span><span id="page-564-1"></span>5:20 Attending the Lord in battle were his heavenly forces, here called "the stars" of heaven. In Deuteronomy 4:19 the sun, moon, and stars are described as the army or "host of heaven." This also recalls the Lord's mighty deliverance of his people in Joshua 10, in which he stopped the sun. A similar connection between the stars of heaven and God's heavenly host is drawn in Job 38:7, which refers to a time in which "the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy." The so-called gods of the Canaanites, like Baal, were thought to control the weather, and the peoples came to worship the sun, moon, and stars. In stark contrast, the Lord alone reigns from heaven, and he controls both the visible and invisible forces of those realms (cf. Ezek. 32:7; Jer. 31:35).

<span id="page-564-16"></span><span id="page-564-9"></span>5:21–22 The army of Sisera assembled in the valley of the Kishon River. Israel stationed herself above, on Mount Tabor. As the great storm theophany moved out to defeat Sisera and his troops, the Lord caused the waters of the river to swell to such a degree that they rendered useless Sisera's army of iron chariots and horses. What was once a military advantage became a liability. Thus Sisera had to flee on foot (Judg. 4:15). The defeat of the enemy with chariots in a great flood of water provides yet another connection with the events of Exodus 14.

<span id="page-564-10"></span><span id="page-564-6"></span><span id="page-564-0"></span>5:23 This section of the song comes to an end with a curse. The angel of the Lord himself calls for Meroz and its inhabitants to be cursed "thoroughly." This language is very strong, and it returns us to the theme of the previous section, which contrasted the tribes that did and did not participate with the Lord in battle. The city of Meroz appears only here in the OT; neither its location nor its inhabitants are known. Perhaps this is part of the curse.

<span id="page-564-12"></span>5:24–27 The previous section of this song ended with a curse. By way of poetic contrast, this section begins with the blessing of Jael for her role in the defeat and death of Sisera. These events constituted a major portion of the narrative account in Joshua 4 and are rehearsed again here in further detail.19

<span id="page-564-11"></span><span id="page-564-2"></span>The blessing of Jael in Judges 5:24 begins and ends with the same Hebrew word for "blessing" (inclusio). Her identification as the wife of Heber the Kenite occupies the central position in the blessing, with two prepositional phrases that begin with the same Hebrew preposition. The significance of Jael was anticipated by the previous references to the Kenites in the book (1:16; 4:11, 17 [2x]). This blessing highlights the fulfillment of the prophetic word of Deborah in 4:9: "The Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman."

<span id="page-564-13"></span><span id="page-564-5"></span><span id="page-564-4"></span>The milk, tent, tent peg, and hammer of Jael all reappear in this poetic account. The focus, however, is on the death of Sisera in 5:26–27. In verse 26 the death blow is described four times, like the pounding of the hammer itself. She "struck," "crushed," "shattered," and "pierced"! In verse 27 Sisera slips away into death. Three different verbs are used a total of seven times to portray his death in

<span id="page-564-14"></span><span id="page-564-7"></span><sup>19</sup> For the redemptive-historical and typological significance of Sisera's death at the hand of Jael cf. comment on 4:21–22.

slow motion. The final description as "dead" could also be translated "destroyed," capturing the gruesome image of the shattered skull of this army general on the floor of Jael's tent.

<span id="page-565-6"></span><span id="page-565-5"></span><span id="page-565-4"></span>5:28–30 The shock of Sisera's death is portrayed in this next section through the eyes of his mother. She is depicted as waiting for the return of her son, wondering why he has been delayed (v. 28). The counsel of her wise comforters (v. 29) reckons that his delay has been caused by the extra time required to divide the spoils of war. Her language in verse 30 is crass at best. In addition to assuming he is collecting costly fabric, Sisera's mother thinks her son has been delayed because he and his army have remained to violate the women of the land. The Hebrew text could be translated "a womb, two wombs for the head [a euphemism] of a man." At the beginning of this song (v. 7) Deborah is described as the mother of Israel, raised up by the Lord to render judgment. Now at the end of the song Sisera's mother has come under that judgment.

<span id="page-565-11"></span><span id="page-565-7"></span><span id="page-565-3"></span>5:31a The closing lines of the song contain two contrasting appeals. The first is that all of God's enemies would perish like the Canaanites. As did the destruction of Egypt in the waters of the Red Sea, now the destruction of the Canaanites in the torrents of the Kishon serves as a pattern or type of future judgments. As the Egyptians and the Canaanites came under God's judgment, so one day will all of God's enemies be destroyed and cast out (Rev. 19:11–21). This first appeal also serves as a warning to the people of God: those who would dare return to idolatry after being delivered from it will become God's enemy and thus come under this same threat of destruction. The second appeal, in contrast, is that those who love the Lord would go forth like the sun in its strength. To love God is the first and greatest commandment (Deut. 6:5; Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27; esp. 1 Cor. 16:22), and "they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength" (Isa. 40:31) like the rising of the sun each day.

<span id="page-565-10"></span><span id="page-565-9"></span><span id="page-565-8"></span><span id="page-565-1"></span>5:31b The narrative of the third judge cycle comes to an end with the conventional note of the land's rest during the lifetime of the judge. This is the only account of a major judge that does not record the death of the judge. Deborah and Barak most certainly die. It is unknown, however, why that formulaic element has been omitted from this account.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-565-2"></span><span id="page-565-0"></span>The God who delivered his people from Egypt with great signs and judgments is the same God who continues to save, deliver, and provide for his people today. The account of Deborah and Barak in Judges 4–5 is written in such a way so as to reflect and resemble the exodus events (Exodus 14–15). Like Moses and Miriam, Barak and Deborah lead God's people in both victory and song. The Lord himself leads the charge as the great storm theophany, subduing the chariots and troops of the enemy in the waters of judgment, fighting alongside the host of heaven.

<span id="page-566-0"></span>In the climax of the battle account, the woman Jael crushes the head of that sinister serpent Sisera, reminding us that God's promise to the woman in Genesis 3:15 still stands: her seed will crush the head of the Serpent. These events also point forward to the last great battle, when Jesus Christ will march out with the host of heaven and the saints to bring to an end all that is evil. As it was with the Canaanite army in Judges 4–5, there will be no survivors among the wicked on that day.

<span id="page-566-1"></span>The account of Deborah and Barak provides assurance that the Lord is gracious to his people and sustains them, as he rehearses the patterns of redemption over and over again across the pages of Scripture. The Lord himself is the hero of this account, and the great deliverance testifies to the fact that he alone is the savior of his people, as it is written in Isaiah 43:11–13:

<span id="page-566-3"></span>"I, I am the Lord,

and besides me there is no savior.

I declared and saved and proclaimed,

when there was no strange god among you;

and you are my witnesses," declares the Lord, "and I am God.

Also henceforth I am he;

there is none who can deliver from my hand;

I work, and who can turn it back?"

God's people are not lost in their sins. When they cry out in repentance for help, the Lord is quick to deliver. Judges portrays Israel as a faithless bride, whoring after the so-called gods of the nations, but the Lord is a merciful and forgiving husband in constant pursuit of his wayward and troubled bride. The Lord is mighty to save, but his people continue to be mighty to sin. The judges were raised up to deliver Israel and promote faithfulness to the Lord, but when the judge died, so did Israel's faithfulness to the Lord.

### <span id="page-566-2"></span>JUDGES 6:1–8:35

6 The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian seven years. **2**And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. **3**For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. **4**They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey. **5**For they would come up with their livestock and their

tents; they would come like locusts in number—both they and their camels could not be counted—so that they laid waste the land as they came in. **6**And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord.

**<sup>7</sup>**When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on account of the Midianites, **<sup>8</sup>** the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery. **9**And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. **10**And I said to you, 'I am the Lord your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice."

**<sup>11</sup>**Now the angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. **12**And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, "The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor." **13**And Gideon said to him, "Please, my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?' But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian." **14**And the Lord*<sup>1</sup>* turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?" **15**And he said to him, "Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house." **16**And the Lord said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man." **17**And he said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. **18**Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you." And he said, "I will stay till you return."

**<sup>19</sup>** So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah*<sup>2</sup>* of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them. **20**And the angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them." And he did so. **21**Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight. **<sup>22</sup>**Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord. And Gideon said, "Alas, O Lord God! For now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face." **23**But the Lord said to him, "Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die." **24**Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, The Lord Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.

**25**That night the Lord said to him, "Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it **<sup>26</sup>** and build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down." **<sup>27</sup>** So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.

**<sup>28</sup>**When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. **29**And they said to one another, "Who has done this thing?" And after they had searched and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing." **30**Then the men of the town said to Joash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it." **31**But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down." **32**Therefore on that day Gideon*<sup>3</sup>* was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he broke down his altar.

**<sup>33</sup>**Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. **34**But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. **35**And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.

**<sup>36</sup>**Then Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, **37**behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said." **38**And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. **39**Then Gideon said to God, "Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew." **40**And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.

7 Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

**<sup>2</sup>**The Lord said to Gideon, "The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.' **3**Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.' " Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.

**<sup>4</sup>**And the Lord said to Gideon, "The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' shall not go." **<sup>5</sup>** So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, "Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink." **6**And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. **7**And the Lord said to Gideon, "With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and

give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home." **<sup>8</sup>** So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.

**<sup>9</sup>**That same night the Lord said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. **10**But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant. **11**And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp. **12**And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance. **13**When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat." **14**And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp."

**15**As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise, for the Lord has given the host of Midian into your hand." **16**And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars. **17**And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. **18**When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, 'For the Lord and for Gideon.' "

**<sup>19</sup>** So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. **20**Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!" **21**Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled. **22**When they blew the 300 trumpets, the Lord set every man's sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah,*<sup>4</sup>* as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. **23**And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.

**<sup>24</sup>**Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. **25**And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.

8 Then the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they accused him fiercely. **2**And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer? **3**God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger*<sup>5</sup>* against him subsided when he said this.

**<sup>4</sup>**And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing. **<sup>5</sup>** So he said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian." **6**And the officials of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?" **<sup>7</sup>** So Gideon said, "Well then, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers." **8**And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. **9**And he said to the men of Penuel, "When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."

**<sup>10</sup>**Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men who drew the sword. **11**And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt secure. **12**And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.

**<sup>13</sup>**Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. **14**And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventyseven men. **15**And he came to the men of Succoth and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?' " **16**And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson. **17**And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.

**<sup>18</sup>**Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king." **19**And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you." **<sup>20</sup>** So he said to Jether his firstborn, "Rise and kill them!" But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man. **21**Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.

**<sup>22</sup>**Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian." **<sup>23</sup>**Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you." **24**And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil." (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) **<sup>25</sup>**And they answered, "We will willingly give them." And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil. **26**And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels*<sup>6</sup>* of

gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels. **27**And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family. **<sup>28</sup>** So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.

**<sup>29</sup>** Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. **30**Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring,*<sup>7</sup>* for he had many wives. **<sup>31</sup>**And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. **32**And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

**<sup>33</sup>**As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and whored after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god. **34**And the people of Israel did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side, **<sup>35</sup>** and they did not show steadfast love to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-571-2"></span>Gideon is the fourth major judge in the book of judges. Additionally, the account of Gideon begins the presentation of the second set or panel of major judges. The major judges are arranged in two sets of three. The first set comprises Othniel, Ehud, and Deborah/Barak. The second comprises Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson (cf. Introduction: Genre and Literary Features). The accounts of the first three judges are relatively short, comprising only 80 total verses (Judg. 3:7–5:31). The accounts of Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson, on the other hand, span 326 verses (6:1–16:31). The accounts of Gideon and of Samson (c. 100 verses each) each contains more verses than do the accounts of the first three major judges combined. It is clear, then, that the narrative freight of these judges represents the focus of the book.

<span id="page-571-3"></span><span id="page-571-1"></span><span id="page-571-0"></span>With Deborah and Barak, the Lord saved his people in the pattern of the exodus recorded in Exodus 14–15. With Gideon, the Lord will save his people with a new Moses, echoing the call of Moses and the signs of his calling in Exodus 3–6.20 The author of Judges is not simply recording spectacular moments in the life of Israel, with superstar saviors holding the title of judge. Rather, the author is confirming patterns of redemption first established in the book of Exodus that will continue on into the NT in the person and work of Jesus. For example, at the transfiguration of Jesus in the Gospels, he appears with Moses and speaks of his "departure"

<span id="page-572-8"></span><span id="page-572-0"></span>(Gk. *exodos*; Luke 9:31). The history of redemption unfolds in recurring patterns that begin with creation in Genesis 1–3 and end with the consummation of all things in Revelation 20–22.

<span id="page-572-9"></span><span id="page-572-7"></span><span id="page-572-4"></span>As the outline below demonstrates, the account of Gideon contains a number of individual episodes. It may be helpful, however, to consider the whole in three large blocks. In Judges 6 Gideon is called by the Lord and purges the idols from his household. In Judges 7 the Lord defeats the Midianites. In Judges 8 the remnant of the Midianite army is defeated, but Israel experiences internal crisis. The Israelites have become their own worst enemy.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-572-5"></span><span id="page-572-1"></span>6:1 The opening formula for the Gideon narrative is identical to that for the Othniel narrative (3:7): "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord." This particular formula is used to mark the two main sections in the judge narratives. The other four major judge narratives begin with a modified version of this formula, having a continuative nuance rendered as "again did": "And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord" (3:12; 4:1; 10:6; 13:1).

<span id="page-572-6"></span><span id="page-572-3"></span><span id="page-572-2"></span>Because of Israel's evil, this time the Lord gives the people into the hand of the Midianites (which, according to 6:3, includes "the Amalekites and the people of the East"). Lasting seven years, this period of oppression is the shortest so far in the book, but the oppression is much more severe than that of previous accounts. For example, in the account of Ehud, Israelite oppression took the form of exacted tribute. In the days of Deborah, the highways were abandoned because of the instability of the region and the threat of military force. In this instance, however, crops and livestock are almost completely devastated, a condition that would require a quick response.

<span id="page-573-5"></span><span id="page-573-3"></span>6:2 The Midianite oppression of Israel is described using the same language as that used for Othniel's prevailing over Cushan-rishathaim in 3:10. The oppression is so intense that the Israelites are forced to resort to dens, caves, and strongholds. The exact purpose of these structures is not described. However, given the context, it seems likely that they are used to store and hide crops and livestock from the raiding Midianites. Such sites could also be for hiding people (e.g., 1 Kings 18:13), but the focus here is on agriculture. This would also explain why Gideon threshes wheat in a winepress.

<span id="page-573-11"></span><span id="page-573-8"></span><span id="page-573-7"></span><span id="page-573-6"></span>6:3–5 These verses record the severity of the Midianite oppression using several different literary devices intended to highlight the extreme nature of Israel's oppression. The author adds "the Amalekites and the people of the East" to the list of oppressors in order to note the regional scope of oppression. The use of the verbs "come up" (Judg. 6:3) and "encamp" (6:4) highlights the military nature of the invasion force. In verse 4 it is recorded that these raiders leave "no sustenance" (or "no living thing") behind—not even a sheep, an ox, or a donkey. The verb "to devour, lay waste" appears in both verse 4 and verse 5—the oppressors devour both the produce of the land and the land itself, a complete devastation. The hordes of the Midianites include their innumerable tents, livestock, and camels to the degree that they are likened to a locust plague. This description might be intended to recall the plague of locust in Exodus 10, and certainly the curse of Deuteronomy 28:38: "You shall carry much seed into the field and shall gather in little, for the locust shall consume it." This is one of the curses listed in a lengthy series of curses set forth for those unfaithful to the covenant, especially by way of idolatry (cf. Deut. 28:15–16).

<span id="page-573-9"></span><span id="page-573-2"></span><span id="page-573-1"></span><span id="page-573-0"></span>6:6 Due to the extreme nature of the Midianite oppression, Israel is "brought very low." However, this sad state of affairs has its desired impact: Israel cries to the Lord for help. The language of repentance after having been brought low is well expressed with the same verb in Psalm 79:8:

<span id="page-573-12"></span> Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.

<span id="page-573-10"></span><span id="page-573-4"></span>6:7–10 In this instance, before the Lord raises up a judge to deliver his people, he sends a prophet to rebuke them. The appearance of a prophet in this account echoes the appearance of Deborah as a prophetess in Judges 4. Judges 6:7 explicitly <span id="page-574-12"></span><span id="page-574-10"></span>connects the sending of the prophet to Israel's cry for help in the previous verse. The prophetic rebuke in verses 8–10 comes in the form of a covenant lawsuit. This lawsuit is closely related to that delivered by the angel of the Lord in 2:1–3. Its purpose is at least twofold. First, it establishes the fact that Israel's oppression is due to her idolatry. Second, the statement of this idolatry stands in contrast to the Lord's faithfulness to his people as the one who delivered them from Egypt and gave them the land they have now corrupted. One element of the overall message of the Former Prophets is the faithfulness of the Lord to keep all of his covenant promises in spite of Israel's unfaithfulness to the obligations of that covenant (Josh. 21:45; 23:14; 1 Kings 8:56). It is clear, therefore, that the Lord is faithful both to punish Israel for her idolatry and then to save her when she cries out to him for help—a double mercy. It would be cruel to allow Israel to continue in her idolatry without the consequent oppression that provokes her to repentance. The Lord is indeed jealous for his people: "You shall worship no other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God" (Ex. 34:14).

<span id="page-574-14"></span><span id="page-574-9"></span><span id="page-574-8"></span><span id="page-574-1"></span>6:11 Judges 6:11–24 records Gideon's call to serve as Israel's next judge. As the account unfolds, it becomes clear that the calling of Gideon follows the pattern of the calling of Moses in Exodus 3. Just as the Lord saved Israel in Judges 4–5 in the pattern and likeness of the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea, so now will he raise up Gideon in the pattern and likeness of the calling of Moses. Table 3.1 identifies some of those features common to each account.

<span id="page-574-0"></span>TABLE 3.1: The Calls of Moses and Gideon21

<span id="page-574-18"></span><span id="page-574-17"></span><span id="page-574-11"></span><span id="page-574-6"></span><span id="page-574-5"></span>This is the third time the angel of the Lord has appeared in Judges. He first appeared in 2:1–3 to rebuke Israel for her idolatry, and then in 5:23 to curse Meroz. This time the angel of the Lord has arrived to call and commission Gideon to serve as the instrument through which the Lord will deliver his people from the Midianites. Gideon is identified by his father and clan from the tribe of Manasseh. The scene is the terebinth at Ophrah. A terebinth is a large tree, perhaps an oak. There Gideon is beating out wheat in a winepress in order to hide from the

21 For a similar type of comparison cf. Shalom-Guy, "Call Narratives of Gideon and Moses," 15–16.

Midianites. The translation "to hide it" could also be rendered "to flee." Gideon has fled in order to hide the wheat and himself from the Midianites.

<span id="page-575-5"></span><span id="page-575-4"></span><span id="page-575-1"></span>6:12 In verse 11 the angel of the Lord was described as sitting under the terebinth tree, perhaps watching Gideon from a distance. Now the angel manifests himself to Gideon and speaks with him. His opening speech comprises two parts. First he confirms the divine presence: "The Lord is with you." This statement accords with the nature of the office of judge as described in 2:18: "Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge." Second, the angel delivers what is typically treated as a vocative expression describing Gideon: "O mighty man of valor." It is perhaps better, however, to understand the second portion of this speech as an adverbial modifier, describing the manner in which the Lord has presented himself to Gideon. In other words, when the angel of the Lord appears to Gideon, he does so as a man of war ready to deliver Israel (cf. Josh. 5:13–15). This interpretation is to be preferred for at least three reasons. First, in the previous verse Gideon is described as hiding from the Midianite army—not the activity of a mighty warrior. Second, in the accounts of deliverance recorded in Judges it is the Lord who gives the enemy into the hand of the judge and goes out to lead in battle as the divine warrior (e.g., Judg. 4:14–15; 5:4–5, 20–23). Third, the defeat of the Midianites in chapter 7 is achieved by the Lord alone in the presence of three hundred Israelites who never raise a sword (7:22), so that Israel could not boast by saying, "My own hand has saved me" (7:2).

<span id="page-575-11"></span><span id="page-575-10"></span><span id="page-575-9"></span><span id="page-575-6"></span><span id="page-575-3"></span><span id="page-575-2"></span><span id="page-575-0"></span>6:13 Gideon responds to the angel of the Lord by asking about the reality of the divine presence. In the previous verse, the angel stated that the Lord was with Gideon (singular). Now Gideon inquires regarding the divine presence for all Israel (plural). Gideon's question is theological in nature. If the Lord is truly with his people, then why are they subject to Midianite oppression? Gideon's question implies that the Lord must not be with his people. The answer to this question is not repeated; it was already provided by the prophet in verses 8–10: the Lord is not with Israel because she has not obeyed the Lord. This scene is filled with irony, given that the Lord himself is standing with Gideon speaking face to face to him while he questions that very reality. Soon Gideon will have his own road-to-Emmaus experience as he comes to discover the identity of the man with whom he is speaking.

<span id="page-575-8"></span><span id="page-575-7"></span>6:14 Having already answered Gideon's question through the prophet, the Lord responds simply by commissioning Gideon. The author now refers to the angel of the Lord as Yahweh himself when he turns to Gideon. The commission comprises three parts. First is the statement that Gideon is to "go in this might of yours." This statement is frequently misunderstood as referring to some inherent strength in Gideon, but nothing could be further from the truth. Given the context, the strength of Gideon is the promise of the divine presence that appears in verses 12 and 16, bracketing this statement. Gideon's strength is the Lord himself (cf.

<span id="page-576-6"></span>Ex. 3:11–12; 2 Chron. 20:6). The second part of the commission is the promise of victory over Midian by Gideon though the strength of the Lord. The final part is a rhetorical question used to express certainty. In other words "Do not I send you?" is to be understood as "I have indeed sent you!" This same type of language was used in the commission of Barak in Judges 4:6.

<span id="page-576-16"></span><span id="page-576-11"></span><span id="page-576-10"></span>6:15–16 In response to the Lord's commission, Gideon states that he is not qualified to lead Israel or to defeat Midian, due to the status of his clan and his position in the family. It is, however, this very condition that qualifies Gideon for service, due to the fact that "God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong" (1 Cor. 1:27; cf. 2 Cor. 12:9). The selection of Gideon and the nature of the battle in the following chapter highlights the strength and power of the Lord, not the strength of Gideon or Israel's army. Gideon's objection parallels the objection of Moses in Exodus 3:11 (cf. Ex. 4:10–12), and the response to both is the same: "I will be with you." The promise of the divine presence is what qualifies Gideon for service—nothing else.22

<span id="page-576-12"></span><span id="page-576-7"></span><span id="page-576-5"></span>6:17–19 Following the promise of the divine presence is the giving of a confirmatory sign. With Moses this would be Israel's worship at the mountain of God (Ex. 3:12). With Gideon this will be the acceptance of a meal as a gift. The sharing of a meal symbolizes the favorable relationship between two parties (cf. Gen. 18:1–8; Ex. 2:20–21).

<span id="page-576-14"></span><span id="page-576-13"></span><span id="page-576-8"></span><span id="page-576-4"></span><span id="page-576-3"></span><span id="page-576-0"></span>6:20–22 The designation "angel of the Lord" returns in these verses (also "angel of God" in Judg. 6:20). Rather than the meal's being eaten, as would be expected, it is set out on a rock and taken up in fire. The consuming of the gift in this fashion turns the meal into a sacrifice on an altar. When the Lord ascends in the flame of the offering, Gideon comes to understand the identity of the person with whom he has been speaking, and he responds with appropriate fear. To "see" or "speak with" God face to face is rare in the OT and depicts a very special relationship. The Lord condescended in this way with Jacob (Gen. 32:30), Moses (Ex. 33:11; Deut. 34:10), Israel at Sinai (Deut. 5:4), and Gideon. In each instance the human party responds with fear, and the Lord provides assurance with a statement such as "Fear not!" The encounter with Jacob is instructive: "So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, 'For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered'" (Gen. 32:20). Later in Judges (13:19–23) these same events will be repeated with Samson's parents. Finally, the seeing of God's face constitutes the eschatological hope of final satisfaction, when "they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads" (Rev. 22:4). When that day comes there will be no fear, only worship.

<span id="page-576-17"></span><span id="page-576-15"></span><span id="page-576-2"></span>6:23–24 The Lord responds graciously to Gideon's fear with three words of comfort. In response Gideon builds an altar to memorialize the event. The name of the altar, "The Lord is peace," reflects the first word of assurance given to Gideon,

<span id="page-576-9"></span><span id="page-576-1"></span><sup>22</sup> For the significance of the divine presence in previous accounts cf. Genesis 26:3; 31:3; Exodus 3:12; 4:12, 15; Deuteronomy 31:23; Joshua 1:5; 3:7.

"Peace be to you." With Gideon's fear transformed into worship as he builds an altar to the Lord, he is now ready to destroy the altar of Baal in his father's house.

<span id="page-577-2"></span>6:25–26 Before Gideon marches out to fight the Midianites, he must first deal with the true cause of Israel's oppression: her own idolatry. On the very night the angel of the Lord appears to Gideon, he is commanded to destroy the altar of Baal and the Asherah with it. Asherah, the consort of Baal, was typically represented by a tree or wooden pole. The command to "pull down" the altar constitutes an act of faithfulness to the covenant. In a section of Exodus describing Israel's occupation of the land it is commanded, "You shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them, nor do as they do, but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their pillars in pieces" (Ex. 23:24; cf. Ex. 23:33). The Hebrew verb translated "overthrow" is the same verb translated "pull down" in Judges 6:25.

<span id="page-577-1"></span><span id="page-577-0"></span>Most understand Gideon to take two bulls from his father's household. However, the text could also be read in a way that indicates just one bull: "Take the bull that belongs to your father, that is, the second bull seven years old."23 Here "second" would identify the specific bull to be selected from the herd. With this bull Gideon will pull down the altar of Baal and then offer it as a sacrifice on a new altar built for "the Lord your God." The stones of the new altar are to be "laid in due order." The word translated here is also a technical term for a battle line of soldiers; it features prominently in the David and Goliath narrative, for example. Its use here may suggest that the Lord is getting ready to do battle, both with Baal and with the Midianites hoards.

<span id="page-577-3"></span>6:27 Gideon does just what the Lord has commanded. He does so at night because he fears how the people of the town will respond. This fear is often considered to be a flaw in Gideon's character, even a lack of faith. It is unclear, however, why this should be so. First, verse 25 indicates that the Lord commanded Gideon to tear down the altar of Baal "that night." Second, Gideon is right to be afraid. The next morning the accusing mob is ready to put him to death for what he has done. Third, the text states that Gideon did exactly what the Lord had commanded him to do. It is perhaps better to understand Gideon's obedience in spite of fear as an expression of courage. This is the same Gideon who earlier in the chapter was hiding from the Midianites in a winepress. Now he is acting courageously by standing with the Lord against Israel's idolatry.

<span id="page-577-4"></span>6:28–30 As Gideon's fear rightly anticipated, the people of the town respond by mobbing together. They demand that Gideon's father hand over his son in order to be put to death. The severity of this response may seem extreme—why would the destruction of an altar provoke such a violent reaction? Perhaps the people of the town think they will come under the curse of Baal and Asherah, jeopardizing the flourishing of their crops and livestock. Or perhaps they are angered by the destruction of a site whose worship would include illicit sexual activity. Either

<sup>23</sup> Block, *Judges, Ruth*, 266.

way, it is tragic that the town does not applaud the work of Gideon. This is a clear indication of the progressive deterioration of Israel at this time.

<span id="page-578-13"></span><span id="page-578-5"></span>6:31–32 The text does not tell us why, but Joash defends his son by putting Baal on trial. In the tradition of Elijah and the prophets of Baal in 1 Kings 18, Baal is given the opportunity to defend the honor of his altar by putting Gideon to death: "If he is a god, let him contend for himself." The fact that Gideon remains alive is the implicit condemnation of this false and impotent god. The Hebrew verb translated "contend" appears four times in these two verses. The term has a range of meaning that includes "to attack, brawl, quarrel, complain, or engage in a lawsuit." The legal nuance best suits this particular context. Gideon's vindication is memorialized in his new name, "Jerubbaal." The first part of the name is derived from the Hebrew verb translated "contend" in these verses. The second part is the name Baal. This is the name Samuel recalls in his farewell speech in 1 Samuel 12:11. This section of narrative began with the time marker "that night" (Judg. 6:25), symbolizing the darkness of Israel's idolatry. Now, with the destruction of Baal's altar and his reputation, a new day has dawned for Israel, and so the narrative comes to an end with a reference to "that day" (v. 32).

<span id="page-578-12"></span><span id="page-578-7"></span><span id="page-578-6"></span><span id="page-578-4"></span><span id="page-578-1"></span>6:33 This next section of the narrative begins with reference to the events described in verse 3. The Midianites, along with the Amalekites and the people of the East, have crossed the Jordan for their annual plundering of Israel's crops and livestock. The use of the word "all" denotes a large invasion force, as innumerable as locusts (v. 5). In response the Lord clothes Gideon with the Spirit, and Gideon summons Israel to battle and asks the Lord to perform two signs with the fleece of a sheep.

<span id="page-578-14"></span><span id="page-578-11"></span><span id="page-578-3"></span><span id="page-578-2"></span><span id="page-578-0"></span>6:34 The twofold promise of divine presence (vv. 12, 16) comes to full expression when the Lord clothes Gideon with the Spirit. It is this enabling presence of the Spirit that provides Gideon with the necessary strength and ability to fulfill his calling as judge. In Judges Othniel (3:10), Jephthah (11:29), and Samson (13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14) also receive the enabling power of the Spirit. The language of being "clothed" with the Spirit is rare in the OT, appearing only with Gideon here, with Amasai in 1 Chronicles 12:18, and with Zechariah in 2 Chronicles 24:20. In the NT, however, Christians are exhorted to put on the "armor of light" (Rom. 13:12), the "Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 13:14; cf. Gal. 3:27), the "new self" (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10), and various expressions of love (Col. 3:12). In the case of Gideon the Lord clothes him for battle in the likeness of Ephesians 6:11: "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil" (cf. 1 Thess. 5:8).

<span id="page-578-19"></span><span id="page-578-18"></span><span id="page-578-17"></span><span id="page-578-16"></span><span id="page-578-15"></span><span id="page-578-10"></span><span id="page-578-9"></span><span id="page-578-8"></span>6:35 Warriors assembled from Gideon's own clan, the Abiezrites (Judg. 6:34), are sent out as messengers to assemble warriors from four tribes: Manasseh (Gideon's tribe), Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali. According to 7:3, approximately thirty-two thousand warriors answer the call of Gideon. With the army of Israel before him, Gideon will ask the Lord to perform two signs in order to provoke faith and encourage those assembled.

<span id="page-579-5"></span>6:36–40 In the presence of the assembled forces Gideon asks the Lord to perform two signs before entering into battle with the Midianites. These signs are not employed in order to determine the will of God. God has spoken clearly to Gideon, and Gideon understands what God desires him to do: to "save Israel by my hand, *as you have said*."24 Additionally, the request for a sign before entering into battle does not necessarily constitute a lack of faith on Gideon's part. He is now clothed with the Spirit of God and serving as God's instrument of deliverance.

<span id="page-579-2"></span><span id="page-579-1"></span>We have already seen how the call of Gideon connects him with Moses in the tradition of Exodus 3. In the same way, the signs of Gideon correspond to similar signs given to Moses in Exodus 4.25 There the Lord gives Moses two signs, the sign of the staff changing into a serpent and the sign of a leprous hand being made clean. The elements of the sign are symbolic of the events to which they point. For example, the staff that becomes a serpent represents Pharaoh, who wears the image of a serpent on his crown. Moses is then commanded to take the serpent with his hand, and it turns back into a staff. This sign demonstrates that the Lord will indeed give Pharaoh into the hand of Moses. These signs are to be performed so that the Israelites will believe that God has raised up Moses to deliver his people (Ex. 4:1, 30–31). In the same way, the fleece signs of Gideon are intended to demonstrate that the Lord has indeed raised up Gideon to deliver Israel from Midianite oppression. Once again, these signs do not reveal the will of God; rather, they are signs coming after the revelation of God's will to provide his people with the courage to do that which he has revealed to them.

<span id="page-579-3"></span><span id="page-579-0"></span>The ground of the threshing floor represents the land of Israel. The expression "all the ground" occurs three times. The word for "ground" in Hebrew also means "land," and a Hebrew reader would have made the connection. The fleece of wool represents the Midianite army and their hordes of camels that have crossed the Jordan to consume Israel's crops and livestock. The dew symbolizes the blessing of God (Gen. 27:28; Deut. 33:13 ESV mg.; Ps. 133:3), the crops and livestock produced from God's gift of the land to his people. In the first fleece sign the land is dry and the fleece is wet with dew, symbolizing Israel's current situation, as the Midianites consume what God intended for Israel in the form of blessing. In the second fleece sign the fleece is dry and the land is wet with dew, symbolizing that God is about to reverse the situation and return the conditions of blessing to his people.

By the time we arrive at the end of this chapter, the Lord has sent his prophet to rebuke Israel for her idolatry, raised up a Spirit-empowered deliverer, destroyed the altar of Baal and Asherah, assembled the army of Israel, and performed two signs to encourage the faith of those assembled for battle. Now the Lord is ready to fight for Israel against the Midianites and purge them from the land.

<span id="page-579-4"></span><sup>24</sup> Block writes, "Contrary to popular interpretation, this text has nothing to do with discovering or determining the will of God. The divine will is perfectly clear in his mind (v. 16)" ( *Judges, Ruth*, 272).

<sup>25</sup> For this interpretation of the fleece signs cf. Gordon P. Hugenberger, "Knowing God's Will—Put Out a Fleece?," June 20, 2010, sermon preached at Park Street Church, Boston, MA, audio, 51:21, https://www.park street.org/sermons.

<span id="page-580-7"></span><span id="page-580-1"></span>7:1–2 The army of Israel has assembled and encamped against the Midianites.26 But before the Lord leads out in battle, he must first ensure that Israel will understand the nature and significance of the upcoming victory. One of the major themes running through Judges is that the Lord himself leads in battle to deliver his people, doing so in the tradition of the exodus. This is why he always introduces himself to his people in the OT by declaring, "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery" (Ex. 20:2; cf. Judges 2:1, 12; 6:8, 13; 11:13, 16; 19:30). The victory of God at the Red Sea established the pattern by which he would continue to save and deliver his people—"The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name" (Ex. 15:3). Reflecting on this theme, the prophet Isaiah states, "The Lord goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his zeal; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes" (Isa. 42:13).

<span id="page-580-11"></span><span id="page-580-9"></span><span id="page-580-5"></span><span id="page-580-0"></span>The Lord understands the nature of Israel's spiritual blindness and graciously puts on display the truth of his power and glory in order to prevent his people from returning to their idolatry. Sadly, they fail to learn this lesson. When the battle is over, they will attempt to make Gideon their king: "Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, 'Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, *for you have saved us from the hand of Midian*'" (Judg. 8:22). Once again, the Israelites confuse the instrument of the Lord's deliverance (Gideon) with the actual agent of deliverance (the Lord himself). The Israelites *should* respond with the words of Psalm 20, especially verse 7: "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God."

<span id="page-580-10"></span><span id="page-580-8"></span><span id="page-580-6"></span><span id="page-580-3"></span>7:3 In order to prevent Israel from boasting in her own strength, the Lord reduces the size of the army that will strike the first great blow against the Midianites. The Lord uses two tests to reduce the size of the army, the test of trembling and the test of water. In the first test the Lord commands Gideon to dismiss all who are "fearful and trembling." In Judges 7:1 Israel had assembled at the "spring of Harod" (= "spring of trembling"). Thus at the spring of trembling the Lord dismisses those who are trembling. In Deuteronomy 20 the Lord establishes laws for Israel's wars. One such law deals with a fearful warrior: "The officers shall speak further to the people, and say, 'Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his fellows melt like his own'" (Deut. 20:8). Nevertheless, it is surprising that nearly 70 percent of the army is dismissed due to fear.

<span id="page-580-4"></span><span id="page-580-2"></span>7:4 Having dismissed 70 percent of the standing army, the Lord institutes a second test in order to reduce further the size of the army. This second test divides the army by the way in which the soldiers drink water from the spring at their camp. The word translated "test" is a metallurgical term meaning to "smelt, refine, or sift." As such, the intention of the Lord's test is to refine or sift the army until he has reduced its forces to the desired number.

<sup>26</sup> For the location of the army encampments and subsequent pursuit in battle cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 111–112, maps 4.19 and 4.C.

<span id="page-581-4"></span><span id="page-581-3"></span><span id="page-581-2"></span>7:5–6 The exact nature of the prescribed test is unclear due to a potential difficulty with the original Hebrew text. In Judges 7:5 the army is to be divided into two groups. The first group drinks from the spring like a dog, lapping with the tongue. The second group kneels down to drink. In verse 6, however, it is stated that the first group that lapped like a dog drank by "putting their hands to their mouths" and the second group knelt down to drink. The trouble arises with the first group. Do the soldiers lap like a dog with their tongues, or do they put their hands to their mouths (something a dog cannot do)? It appears this problem has been caused by the misplacement of the words "putting their hands to their mouth" (v. 6), two prepositional phrases in Hebrew. Some have suggested that these two prepositional phrases should appear at the end of verse 5 rendering the second group as "those who kneel down to drink *with their hands to their mouths*."27 This makes good sense. In this reading the two groups are distinguished by those who lap water like a dog with their tongues and those who cup their hands to drink water like a human. The original Hebrew text has been preserved, with one phrase simply misplaced over the long history of faithful transmission. This interpretation is further supported by the LXX. In some LXX manuscripts verse 6 refers to "those who lapped with their tongue," omitting the mention of "the hands" that has caused the confusion. The text does not indicate why the Lord uses this method to separate the two groups. We only know that the Lord chooses the smaller group to work with Gideon.

<span id="page-581-7"></span><span id="page-581-5"></span>7:7–8 After the completion of the sifting or refining process, only three hundred men remain with Gideon, a number highlighted three times in verses 6–8. This is a 99 percent reduction in forces! In chapter 8 the Midianites will number at least 135,000 men. Humanly speaking, the odds are stacked against Israel, being outnumbered by a ratio of 450 to 1. The other Israelites are dismissed "every man to his home [or "place"]" (v. 7), that is, to his "tent" (v. 8) at the army camp. Later, after the Lord uses the three hundred men to defeat Midian, the rest of the army will come out in pursuit of the survivors.

<span id="page-581-8"></span><span id="page-581-6"></span><span id="page-581-1"></span>7:9 The expression "that same night" marks the beginning of a new section in the narrative, the destruction of the Midianites. This same expression appeared in 6:25 to begin the section recording the destruction of the altar of Baal. The Lord commands Gideon to arise and go down into the camp, "for I have given it into your hand." The language of giving someone or something over into the hand of another plays a significant role in chapter 7. It is used five times (vv. 2, 7, 9, 14, 15). Additionally, in verse 11 the Lord strengthens Gideon's hand. This marks the reversal of the Lord's giving Israel "into the hand of Midian" (6:1).

<span id="page-581-11"></span><span id="page-581-10"></span><span id="page-581-9"></span><span id="page-581-0"></span>7:10–11 Before Gideon summons his army of three hundred warriors to engage the Midianite hordes, the Lord provides him with an opportunity to confront any lingering fear. The nature of the command is instructive: "If you are afraid to

<sup>27</sup> Chisholm, *Commentary on Judges and Ruth*, 282, emphasis original.

go down, go down . . ." The verb "go down" is used four times in these two verses. Gideon's fear to go down will be solved by his *going down* to the Midianite camp. In this way the Lord will strengthen the hand of Gideon, providing the encouragement necessary to deal with his fear. Gideon's fear is not to be understood as a character flaw. He has been commanded to engage the Midianite army with only three hundred men. His fear is understandable, and yet he obeys the Lord by going down into the Midianite camp to deal with that fear. Obedience to the Lord in the midst of fear is courageous, not sinful.

<span id="page-582-17"></span><span id="page-582-7"></span><span id="page-582-4"></span><span id="page-582-1"></span>7:12 The narrative pauses briefly to describe the impressive size of the Midianite forces with reference to 6:5. To that previous description the characterization "as the sand that is on the seashore" is added. Gideon's army of three hundred is about to engage in battle with what are considered innumerable forces, which are compared to a locust plague (cf. Ex. 10:14; Deut. 28:38; Ps. 78:46; Jer. 46:23; Joel 1:4) and equipped with camels without number. These camels would certainly give the Midianites a strategic advantage in ground warfare. There is, however, a clue to the fate of this army hidden in the text. In this verse it is recorded that the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people of the East "lay along the valley." The verb translated "lay" also means "fall"—they are "falling in the valley." This is the same verb used to describe the deaths of Eglon (Judg. 3:25), the army of Sisera (4:16), and Sisera himself (4:22; 5:27 [3x]). This verb appears two more times in the dream account that follows and then climactically to describe the death of twelve hundred thousand enemy soldiers in 8:10. In fact, the form of the verb in verse 12 is identical to that in verse 10, thus foreshadowing here the later fate of this enemy army. The verb is used later in Judges also to describe similar deaths, including the Levite's concubine (19:27) and those slain from the tribe of Benjamin (20:44, 46).

<span id="page-582-15"></span><span id="page-582-14"></span><span id="page-582-13"></span><span id="page-582-12"></span><span id="page-582-10"></span><span id="page-582-9"></span><span id="page-582-8"></span><span id="page-582-6"></span><span id="page-582-3"></span><span id="page-582-2"></span>7:13–14 In verse 11 the Lord commanded Gideon to go down to the Midianite camp and "hear what they say" in order to be encouraged. Now Gideon and Purah overhear the recounting (v. 13) and subsequent interpretation of a dream (v. 14). In the dream a man sees a loaf of bread rolling into the Midianite camp that strikes a tent and flattens it. The actual point of connection between the sword of Gideon and this cake of barley bread is unknown. Perhaps the bread represents what the Midianites have plundered from the Israelites, coming back upon them in judgment. The man's friend provides the interpretation of the dream: "God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp." Similar dreams with corresponding interpretations occur with both Joseph (Genesis 37; 40–41) and Daniel (Daniel 2; 4; 7).

<span id="page-582-16"></span><span id="page-582-11"></span><span id="page-582-5"></span><span id="page-582-0"></span>7:15 Gideon's response to the dream and its interpretation is now noted. His fear has been transformed into worship yet a second time (cf. Judg. 6:22–24). In 7:12 the Midianite forces are described as being without "number," which forms the rational basis for Gideon's fear. Now the "telling" of the dream turns Gideon's fear <span id="page-583-3"></span>into worship. The word for "number" and "telling" is the same in Hebrew; the usage in this context highlights the fear/worship transformation. The wordplay also connects to the "telling" recorded in verse 13, from the same Hebrew root (*safar*). This section of the narrative comes to an end by returning to the encouragement of verse 9, by which the Lord commanded Gideon to "arise" and go down into the camp because he had given it into his hand. Now Gideon summons the three hundred to "arise," for the Lord has given the camp into their hand.

<span id="page-583-5"></span><span id="page-583-2"></span>7:16–18 These verses record Gideon's plan for battle. His tactics are certainly unexpected; it is unstated whether they are of his device or the Lord's. For an army of only three hundred men we might expect the use of horses, spears, swords, bows, arrows, and as many shields as possible. But instead the army uses trumpets (ram's horns), torches, and empty jars in a nighttime attack. These implements of weakness will highlight the fact that it is the Lord himself who saves his people.

The plan is simple enough. Gideon divides his men into three groups in order to surround the Midianite camp. By placing the torches in the jars, they can approach the camp at night in stealth. The blowing of the trumpets and the smashing of the jars will cause great commotion and confusion. The battle cry aligns Gideon with the Lord and will throw the Midianite camp into great panic, given the interpretation of the dream provided in verse 14: God has given "Midian and all the camp" into the hand of Gideon.

<span id="page-583-6"></span><span id="page-583-4"></span><span id="page-583-0"></span>7:19–20 Gideon's plan for battle is carried out "at the beginning of the middle watch," which begins at midnight and lasts four hours. From a human perspective this plan is sheer folly. A handful of soldiers armed with torches, trumpets (ram's horns), and a battle cry would have the odds stacked seriously against them. This battle plan, however, recalls the destruction of Jericho in Joshua 6. There on the seventh day the men of war and seven priests marched around the city seven times, shouted, and sounded the trumpets (Josh. 6:20–21). At that very moment the walls fell down and the city was devoted to destruction. The fantastic events at Jericho and now here with Gideon serve to highlight the true source of Israel's victory: the warrior Yahweh.

<span id="page-583-9"></span><span id="page-583-8"></span><span id="page-583-7"></span><span id="page-583-1"></span>7:21–22 The description of the actual battle is just as striking as the tactics employed. For Israel, "every man stood in his place around the camp." They do nothing. They simply stand and watch while the Midianite army runs, cries out, and flees. The explanation of Midian's response appears in Judges 7:22. The relationship between verses 21 and 22 is one not of cause and effect but of effect and then cause. In verse 22 the author returns to the sounding of the trumpets in verse 20 and the flight of the Midianite army in verse 21 and explains, "The Lord set every man's sword against his comrade and against all the army." In other words, while Gideon and his men stand around the camp, the Midianites kill each other inside the camp. The Lord uses Gideon's surprise attack at midnight to throw the enemy into a great panic and thus also into a great slaughter. J udges 6:1–8:35 584

Those who survive flee east to return home, but Gideon will pursue and finish what the Lord has started.

<span id="page-584-3"></span><span id="page-584-2"></span>7:23 With the Midianite army in flight, Gideon calls out the warriors previously dismissed in verses 2–7 (cf. 6:35). Together they will pursue those who have survived the slaughter in the camp.

<span id="page-584-4"></span>7:24–25 In addition to the tribes assembled in 6:35 (Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali), Gideon now calls upon Ephraim to seize the crossing points at the Jordan in order to prevent the Midianite army from returning home. Ephraim captures two Midianite princes, puts them to death, and memorializes the event by naming the locations of their deaths "the rock of Oreb" and "the winepress of Zeeb." This reference to the winepress returns us to the beginning of the narrative, in which Gideon was threshing grain in a winepress in order to hide from the Midianites. The Lord heard Israel's cry for help, and now Israel is threshing the Midianites in the winepress. It is the Lord who delivers his people from the enemy. The people of God will recall these events and remember the power of God to deliver not only in the past but also in the future, when ultimate deliverance will come in the fullness of time. Psalm 83:11–12 declares,

<span id="page-584-9"></span> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, who said, "Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God."

The basis for this imprecatory prayer appears at the end of the psalm:

 That they may know that you alone, whose name is the Lord, are the Most High over all the earth. (Ps. 83:18)

<span id="page-584-10"></span><span id="page-584-8"></span><span id="page-584-7"></span><span id="page-584-6"></span><span id="page-584-5"></span><span id="page-584-1"></span><span id="page-584-0"></span>8:1–3 With the defeat of Midian almost complete, Israel becomes its own worst enemy. First, the tribe of Ephraim complains "fiercely" against Gideon for not calling it out to battle as he did the tribes summed in Judges 6:35. The verb rendered "accused" in 8:1 is the same as that used in 6:31–32 when the people of the town "contended" against Gideon for breaking down the altar of Baal. This same verb also forms the first part (Jerub) of his new name, Jerubbaal. Gideon defuses the anger of the Ephraimites with a bit of diplomacy. In the form of a proverb (8:2) he flatters the tribe of Ephraim for its greatness in comparison to his own clan. Then he applauds their victory in battle as being greater than his own (v. 3). Gideon's diplomacy of humility is wise, as it turns away the wrath of the Ephraimites without any further hostility. This brief episode foreshadows similar events recorded in 12:1–6, when the Ephraimites contend with Jephthah. In that instance, however, the diplomacy of Jephthah will not be enough, as fortytwo thousand Ephraimites will perish. Episodes such as these serve to highlight the progressive deterioration of Israel as she become more and more Canaanite in her attitudes and practices.

<span id="page-585-5"></span><span id="page-585-0"></span>8:4–9 With his band of three hundred warriors Gideon crosses the Jordan to capture the kings of Midian (Zebah and Zalmunna) along with fifteen thousand soldiers who have survived the initial battle. Weary from pursuit, Gideon stops at Succoth and Penuel (cf. Gen. 32:30–31) in order to feed and sustain his men. Both towns reject Gideon's request for help, and so he promises retribution when he returns "in peace." Gideon has been raised up by the Lord and clothed with his Spirit to serve as the instrument of Israel's deliverance from Midianite oppression. To refuse to come to his aid is to refuse the Lord himself (cf. Judg. 7:18, 20), which explains the severity of his response. In this way we are reminded of the words of the angel of the Lord in the song of Deborah:

<span id="page-585-4"></span> Curse Meroz, says the angel of the Lord, curse its inhabitants thoroughly, because they did not come to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. (5:23)

<span id="page-585-7"></span><span id="page-585-6"></span><span id="page-585-2"></span>8:10–12 Having fled to Karkor, the remaining Midianite camp "felt secure" (8:11). The exact locations of these sites remain unknown. However, scholars estimate that the army fled approximately 100 miles (160 km) east of the Jordan. This would have been a considerable trek for Gideon and his band of three hundred hungry and weary warriors. In addition to the two kings, the surviving army totals approximately 15,000 men. The text also notes that the number of fallen warriors was a staggering "120,000 men who drew the sword." The characterization of these men as those who "drew the sword" links to the way in which they were defeated: "The Lord set every man's sword against his comrade and against all the army" (7:22). The fact that Gideon and his small band of weary warriors rout an army of 15,000 continues the theme of the Lord's enabling presence with Gideon by the power of his Spirit. When the Lord called Gideon to service he promised him, "I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man" (6:16).

<span id="page-585-9"></span><span id="page-585-8"></span><span id="page-585-3"></span><span id="page-585-1"></span>8:13–17 Having defeated the Midianite army, Gideon returns to Succoth and Penuel with Zebah and Zalmunna "in . . . hand" to fulfill his promises to the inhabitants of those cities. Some may interpret Gideon's actions as overly violent or vengeful, but the Israelites in these two cities had refused to assist their brothers in the war of the Lord against the oppression of Midian. As such, they have become the enemy of the Lord and so are treated according to his law. In Deuteronomy 20:10–13, for instance, it is legislated that if a city does not make peace with Israel's army, the men of the city must be put to the sword. As such, the execution of the men of Penuel (Judg. 8:17) demonstrates that they have become the enemy of the Lord by not coming to the aid of Gideon and his army in their time of need. Once again the author provides readers with a glimpse of the inner corruption of Israel that will come to climactic expression in chapters <span id="page-586-11"></span>19–21. The theme of Israel's corruption continues with further escalation in the accounts of Jephthah and Samson.

<span id="page-586-6"></span><span id="page-586-1"></span>8:18–19 Having captured and returned with the Midianite kings, Gideon interrogates them in order to discover the parties responsible for the previously unmentioned killing of his brothers at Tabor. The threat of the Midianites in the land extended beyond plundering of crops and livestock to include the execution of leading figures' offering resistance to the plunderers. Perhaps this is why the Lord chose Gideon as the instrument of his deliverance. Gideon will serve as the "avenger of blood" for his brothers and all Israel (Num. 35:16–21). Some have argued that Gideon's actions are violent and unjustified, perhaps even a violation of the sixth commandment ("You shall not murder"; Ex. 20:13). However, as the avenger of blood, it is Gideon's responsibility to enact this very punishment on the murderous kings: "The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death" (Num. 35:19). In reference to Gideon and his brothers the Midianites declare, "Every one of them resembled the son of a king." This is the first explicit reference to Israelite kingship in Judges, a theme that will play a major role in the two conclusions to the book (Judges 17–21).

<span id="page-586-10"></span><span id="page-586-7"></span><span id="page-586-5"></span><span id="page-586-4"></span><span id="page-586-2"></span><span id="page-586-0"></span>8:20–21 Gideon commands his oldest son, Jether, to execute Zebah and Zalmunna. But Jether declines, for two reasons. First, he is afraid. This recalls similar statements regarding Gideon earlier in the narrative. It was Gideon's fear that caused him to destroy the altar of Baal at night (6:27) and again to go down into the Midianite camp to hear the report of a dream and its interpretation (7:10). In this way we are reminded of the true Gideon (fearful) and the significance of the enabling presence of God's Spirit at work in him to deliver Israel. The second reason Jether declines, or perhaps the underlying reason for his fear, is his age. He is still a "young man" and so probably lacks battle experience. The word used here for Jether's youth is the same word used repeatedly in reference to David in his encounter with Goliath (1 Sam. 17:33, 42, 55, 58). It is unknown why Gideon commands his son to execute the two kings. Perhaps such a death would be shameful (cf. Judg. 9:54). But they mock the boy and incite Gideon to execute them himself: "For as for the man, so is his strength." The final words of the kings seal their fate and so fulfill the word of the Lord to Gideon: "Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?" (6:14; cf. comment there for the nature and source of Gideon's strength). The execution of these two kings brings the Midianite oppression of Israel to an end.

<span id="page-586-13"></span><span id="page-586-12"></span><span id="page-586-9"></span><span id="page-586-8"></span><span id="page-586-3"></span>8:22–23 The men of Israel respond to their deliverance by attempting to make Gideon their king. Though the exact word for kingship in not employed, the dynastic nature of the request certainly implies kingship (cf. 1 Kings 4:21). Israel's request is tragic. The people's reasoning is their perception that Gideon has saved them from Midian—but nothing could be further from the truth. It was the Lord who performed the fleece signs to make clear his intentions to the assembled forces.

It was the Lord who whittled down the army to three hundred so they would not falsely attribute victory to the strength of their own hand. It was the Lord who routed the Midianite army while three hundred warriors stood by with trumpets and torches in hand. And it was the Lord who clothed Gideon with his Spirit to accomplish his will. The attempt to make Gideon king is to reject the kingship of the Lord, the true deliverer of Israel. If Israel's request is a low point in the book, then Gideon's response is the corresponding high point by way of contrast. By the end of Judges, however, the repeated refrain that there was no king in the land will constitute Israel's ultimate rejection of the Lord as her true King (Judg. 17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25).

<span id="page-587-13"></span><span id="page-587-12"></span><span id="page-587-6"></span><span id="page-587-0"></span>8:24–26 Having denied the request of the men of Israel, Gideon counters with his own request: a gold earring from the spoils of each man. The abundance of gold earrings is explained by their source, the Ishmaelites. The Ishmaelites were also children of Abraham, the older half-brother of Isaac by Hagar, Sarah's handmaiden (Gen. 16:15). Of them the Lord said, "As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation" (Gen. 17:20). The association of the Ishmaelites and the Midianites goes back to Genesis 37:25–28, but the exact relationship remains enigmatic. The weight of the offering amounts to just over 40 pounds (19 kg), a small fortune indeed.

<span id="page-587-16"></span><span id="page-587-15"></span><span id="page-587-14"></span><span id="page-587-11"></span><span id="page-587-10"></span><span id="page-587-7"></span><span id="page-587-3"></span><span id="page-587-2"></span><span id="page-587-1"></span>8:27 With the gold collected, Gideon makes an "ephod." The English word *ephod* is simply a transliteration of the Hebrew word. It is a type of outer garment normally associated with priests, especially the high priest of Israel (Exodus 35; 39). In Judges 17–18 Micah will build an illegitimate "shrine" ("a house for gods"; Judg. 17:5) and place an ephod in it. When David brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, he dances before the Lord while wearing a linen ephod (2 Sam. 6:14; 1 Chron. 15:27). When he flees Saul, he commands the priest to bring him the ephod in order to speak with the Lord and discern his will (1 Sam. 23:6–14). This oracular use of the ephod best explains Gideon's actions. Having rejected kingship, he will serve as Israel's judge, doing the will of the Lord by means of consulting him through the ephod. It is a double tragedy, therefore, that "all Israel" will whore after it (cf. Judg. 2:17) and that it will become a snare (cf. 2:3) to Gideon and his household. But this is Israel's theme song throughout the book: the irresistible lure of idolatry in the face of the Lord's faithfulness, mercy, and power.

<span id="page-587-8"></span><span id="page-587-5"></span><span id="page-587-4"></span>8:28 Upon the Lord's defeat of Midian, the land has rest for forty years, the same amount of time associated with Othniel (3:11) and Barak (5:31).

<span id="page-587-9"></span>8:29–31 Because Gideon has rejected Israel's offer of kingship, he simply returns to his house to live out his days. Then, in preparation for the upcoming Abimelech narrative, the author of the account tells us of Gideon's seventy sons and many wives as well as his concubine in Shechem, who bears him a son named Abimelech, the anti-judge of the book of Judges. Reference to multiple wives, in violation

<span id="page-588-2"></span><span id="page-588-0"></span>of the original marriage-covenant standard, serves frequently as a harbinger of judgment and tragedy. For example, the marriages of the sons of God to the daughters of man in Genesis 6 mark the beginning of the flood judgment, while the sexual corruption of Sodom and Gomorrah precipitate their destruction by fire in Genesis 19. Additionally, in 1 Kings 11 Solomon's vast harem leads him into grievous idolatry, provoking the Lord to anger and resulting in the division of the kingdom, the beginning of the end of Israel's tenure in the land. As such, the reference to Gideon's many wives and sons hints at the tragic events that will befall his household in Judges 9.

<span id="page-588-7"></span><span id="page-588-5"></span><span id="page-588-1"></span>8:32 The death of a judge normally marks the end of the account of that judge and the subsequent return of the people to idolatry. The same is true here—but with extended comment. The reference to Gideon's death "in a good old age" connects him to Abraham (Gen. 15:15; 25:8) and David (1 Chron. 29:28), the only two other people in the OT whose deaths are described in this way. Although all of these men are sinners, they are commended for their faith and courage and appear together in the so-called hall of faith in Hebrews 11.

<span id="page-588-10"></span><span id="page-588-9"></span><span id="page-588-8"></span><span id="page-588-6"></span><span id="page-588-3"></span>8:33–35 Gideon's death precipitates Israel's immediate return to idolatry. The depiction of idolatry as "whoring after" is rooted in the covenantal nature of Israel's relationship to the Lord. Just as a spouse might be unfaithful to a marriage covenant by whoring after other partners (cf. Hosea 1–3), so Israel is unfaithful to her covenantal relationship with the Lord (cf. Ezekiel 16). This reality is expressed also in the name of their false god, "Baal-berith" (= "husband/lord of a covenant"). In their idolatry, Israel forgets the Lord (cf. comment on Judg. 3:7). Having forgotten the Lord and his great deliverance, the people also fail in gratitude toward Gideon as the instrument of the Lord's deliverance. The close connection between the Lord and the judge will continue in the following narratives. That is to say, Israel will treat the judge with the same contempt with which they treat the Lord. This is yet another device used to characterize the ever-increasing corruption of Israel depicted in Judges.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-588-4"></span>Idolatry, subjugation, suffering, and then the Lord's merciful deliverance is the well-established pattern of the judge narratives in Judges. Gideon's questions in 6:13 set the stage for the Lord's deliverance of Israel: "Please, my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?'" In the tradition of the exodus, the Lord raises up a new Moses figure in Gideon and delivers his people from the hand of the enemy yet again. As with the exodus, so will the Lord's deliverance from Midian serve as a pattern or paradigm for future acts of deliverance. For example, when the Lord through Isaiah promises deliverance from Assyria, he does so by recalling his past victories over Egypt and Midian: "The Lord of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck

<span id="page-589-2"></span>Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt" (Isa. 10:26; cf. Ps. 83:9–12). With both Moses and Gideon the Lord chooses weak human vessels clothed with the Spirit as the instruments of his deliverance. It is always in the context of human weakness that the Lord achieves his greatest victories, even the weakness of his own Son's death on the cross.

The remarkable nature of the Lord's victory over Midian with Gideon's meager band of three hundred soldiers reminds us that the Lord is indeed the warrior of Israel, the one who leads in battle to defend his people while they stand and watch. Participation in the remarkable events of this salvation would have caused great fear in any of us, just like it did in Gideon. But Gideon's fear is not to be considered a weakness or some sort of character flaw. Rather, by faith Gideon acts with courage in spite of his justifiable fear, resulting in the full display of the Lord's power on behalf of his people. In the same way we are exhorted to boast in our own weakness as the power of the Lord works in and through us: "I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me" (2 Cor. 12:9).

<span id="page-589-4"></span><span id="page-589-3"></span><span id="page-589-0"></span>Sadly, however, Israel's response is less than positive. Ephraim complains, Succoth and Penuel refuse to help, and the men of Israel attribute their deliverance to Gideon and seek to make him their king. Indeed, they have eyes but cannot see, and ears but cannot hear—the curse of those who worship idols and false gods (Ps. 115:4–8; cf. Deut. 29:4; Isa. 6:9–10). Failing to perceive by faith the power of God in Midian's defeat, Israel quickly returns to idolatry and corruption after the death of Gideon, to the tragic cycle of Judges—a warning for the people of God. "Good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened" (Heb. 4:2).

### <span id="page-589-1"></span>JUDGES 9:1–57

9 Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's relatives and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family, **<sup>2</sup>** "Say in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."

**<sup>3</sup>**And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother." **4**And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him. **5**And he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. **6**And all the leaders of Shechem came together,

and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.

**7**When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them, "Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you. **8**The trees once went out to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.' **9**But the olive tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my abundance, by which gods and men are honored, and go hold sway over the trees?' **10**And the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come and reign over us.' **11**But the fig tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees?' **12**And the trees said to the vine, 'You come and reign over us.' **13**But the vine said to them, 'Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees?' **14**Then all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come and reign over us.' **15**And the bramble said to the trees, 'If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'

**<sup>16</sup>** "Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his deeds deserved — **<sup>17</sup>** for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian, **<sup>18</sup>** and you have risen up against my father's house this day and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative— **<sup>19</sup>** if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. **20**But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech." **<sup>21</sup>**And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and lived there, because of Abimelech his brother.

**<sup>22</sup>**Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. **23**And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, **<sup>24</sup>** that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. **25**And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way. And it was told to Abimelech.

**<sup>26</sup>**And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives, and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him. **27**And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech. **28**And Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? **29**Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. I would say*<sup>1</sup>* to Abimelech, 'Increase your army, and come out.' "

**<sup>30</sup>**When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. **31**And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly,*<sup>2</sup>* saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have

come to Shechem, and they are stirring up*<sup>3</sup>* the city against you. **32**Now therefore, go by night, you and the people who are with you, and set an ambush in the field. **33**Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city. And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as your hand finds to do."

**<sup>34</sup>** So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies. **35**And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush. **<sup>36</sup>**And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!" And Zebul said to him, "You mistake*<sup>4</sup>* the shadow of the mountains for men." **37**Gaal spoke again and said, "Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners' Oak." **38**Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your mouth now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them." **39**And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. **40**And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate. **41**And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem.

**42**On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told. **43**He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them. **44**Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them. **45**And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.

**<sup>46</sup>**When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith. **47**Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together. **48**And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done." **<sup>49</sup>** So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.

**<sup>50</sup>**Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it. **51**But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower. **52**And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. **53**And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull. **54**Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, 'A woman killed him.' " And his young man thrust him through, and he died. **55**And when the men of Israel saw that

Jerubbaal.

Gideon refused to rule over Israel as king because he understood that the Lord was Israel's true King. It is tragic, therefore, that on the heels of Gideon's confession we encounter one of his sons seizing the office of king in an illegitimate manner. Deuteronomy legislates kingship for Israel upon settlement in the land, but the king must be the one "whom the Lord your God will choose" (Deut. 17:15). After murdering all but one of his seventy brothers, Abimelech makes himself king.

<span id="page-592-5"></span><span id="page-592-4"></span>The Abimelech narrative is divided into three unequal parts: the rise of Abimelech, the curse of Jotham, and the fall of Abimelech. The epilogue to the Gideon account (Judg. 8:29–35) provides the background for the Abimelech narrative. Gideon had seventy biological sons because he had numerous wives, a harem of sorts (v. 30). However, he also had an additional son, Abimelech, with a concubine living in Shechem (v. 31). We also learn that, upon the death of Gideon, Israel returned to whoring after other gods (v. 33) and so forgot the goodness both of the Lord and of Gideon to Israel (vv. 34–35). The combination of numerous wives, idolatry, and terrible judgment appears again in the assessment of Solomon's kingship in 1 Kings 11.

He is not raised up by God but rather raised up by himself. He does not deliver God's people but rather kills and oppresses them. He does not bring rest to the land but rather pollutes it with innocent blood. We are reminded of Numbers 35:33: "You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it" (cf. Gen. 9:5–6). In the end God will make atonement for the land with the death of Abimelech and the destruction of the men of Shechem.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-592-9"></span><span id="page-592-3"></span>9:1–2 Abimelech is identified as the son of Jerubbaal, the name given to Gideon when he tore down the altar of Baal in Judges 6. Now Abimelech is about to tear down Gideon's family in his quest to become king. The name Abimelech means <span id="page-593-1"></span>either "my father is king" or "father of a king." Either way the name is striking, given the context. It is not clear what prompts Abimelech to seize power in this fashion. However, the question put to his mother's family clearly recalls Israel's request and Gideon's refusal of kingship in the previous chapter. The verb "to rule," used four times in 8:22–23, appears two more times here in verse 2. "Which is better for you . . . ?" seems to imply that the seventy sons of Gideon are ruling over Israel at the time. This may be true, but it may also be a deceptive scheme of Abimelech to provoke Shechem's allegiance and the securing of funds to establish a mercenary army. He grounds his request in the fact that he is biologically related to his mother's family. This is ironic, given that he is also related to the seventy men he is about to murder.

<span id="page-593-4"></span>9:3–5 The family of Abimelech's mother persuades the "leaders" of Shechem to support Gideon's cause. The Hebrew for "leader" is the same word rendered "Baal" throughout Judges. This is an intentional play on words. Israel worships Baal, and the Shechemites take the money to support Abimelech from the temple of "Baalberith." The worshipers of Baal have become the baals of Shechem. It is true that we become what we worship: "Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them" (Ps. 115:8). Taking money from the temple of Baal-berith connects the actions of Abimelech and the people of Shechem to their idolatry. They have forsaken the way of the Lord and all of his good laws that protect and provide for life. The way of Baal is the way of death, which is what follows.

<span id="page-593-9"></span><span id="page-593-0"></span>Gideon's mercenary army consists of "worthless and reckless fellows." The word translated "worthless" means "empty," the same word used to describe empty jars in Judges 7:16 and the men who gather to Jephthah in 11:3. It is not clear whether this word describes the character of these men or their status. They are free or empty from any other connection or commitment and thus able to join with Abimelech. The term translated "reckless" can mean "insolent, undisciplined, reckless" and certainly describes their poor character. They are reckless and available, and Abimelech pays them off to do his evil bidding.

<span id="page-593-7"></span><span id="page-593-5"></span><span id="page-593-3"></span>The ironic theme of biological kinship continues in these verses. The Shechemites agree to support Abimelech because "he is our brother" (9:3). With their support, however, he plans to murder "his brothers" (v. 5). The Shechemites should have considered the situation more carefully. Family ties mean nothing to Abimelech, for he will soon return to kill all of the people of Shechem and destroy their city (vv. 45–49). In the end, no one survives except Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon. The death of Gideon's sons is tragic, later characterized as the "evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father" (v. 56). We are also reminded of the death of Gideon's brothers reported in 8:18–19. Israel's idolatry continues to pay dividends in death and ever-increasing corruption. This time, however, Israel is its own worst enemy.

<span id="page-593-8"></span><span id="page-593-6"></span><span id="page-593-2"></span>9:6 This first section of the narrative comes to an end with Abimelech installed as king following the execution of his brothers. This is also the first recorded instance <span id="page-594-1"></span><span id="page-594-0"></span>of an Israelite king ruling over God's people in the land. The Lord did promise Abraham and the patriarchs that kings would come from their bodies (Gen. 17:6, 16; 35:11), but Abimelech is not a true king. He is an anti-king. The Lord has not chosen him, and Abimelech does not govern according to the laws of kingship (Deut. 17:14–20). The true King will be raised up by the Lord in order to lay down his life for his brothers so that they might reign together with him (John 10:11–18). By way of absolute contrast, Abimelech becomes king by taking the life of his brothers.

<span id="page-594-14"></span><span id="page-594-7"></span><span id="page-594-6"></span><span id="page-594-5"></span><span id="page-594-4"></span><span id="page-594-3"></span>9:7 Of Gideon's seventy sons, only Jotham has survived, for he hid himself on the day of his brothers' massacre (Judg. 9:5). He now returns and invokes God's presence to make right this great wrong. The setting of Mount Gerizim is no accident. Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal are the mountains of blessing and cursing under the administration of the Mosaic covenant (Deut. 11:29; 27:12). Before these two mountains all Israel assembled to hear the blessings and curses stipulated for obedience (or disobedience) to the law of God, that those mountains might serve as perpetual, enduring witnesses to the covenant (Josh. 8:33). Gerizim was the mountain of blessing. The fact that Jotham stands upon this mountain suggests that Abimelech has taken something God intended as a blessing (kingship) and turned it into a curse. Jotham does not take matters into his own hands, as had Abimelech. Instead he trusts the Lord to be faithful to uphold his covenant. While it takes three years to play out, the Lord does in fact show himself faithful to curse those who are unfaithful to his covenant law (cf. Judg. 9:56–57).

<span id="page-594-10"></span><span id="page-594-9"></span><span id="page-594-8"></span><span id="page-594-2"></span>9:8–15 The curse of Jotham begins with a fable, a tale in which the elements of nature are animated and speak. In this case Jotham employs talking trees to make his point. The trees in the fable represent not only the people of Shechem in particular but also all Israel in general. Later these trees are called "cedars of Lebanon" (v. 15). Four specific types of trees (or plants) are animated in the fable: olive, fig, vine, and bramble. The first three trees are fruit-bearing trees and a source of blessing for Israel (Deut. 8:8), much like Gideon served as a blessing for God's people. The three fruit trees decline the offer of kingship because it would keep them from their intended purpose of bearing fruit. Likewise, the Lord did not raise up Gideon to be king. Rather, the Lord was their King, with Gideon simply the instrument of the Lord's deliverance. Gideon fulfilled his role in the Lord's theocratic economy without grasping for more. Once deliverance was achieved, Gideon returned to his home.

<span id="page-594-13"></span><span id="page-594-12"></span><span id="page-594-11"></span>The bramble (buckthorn, thorn bush) is a non-fruit-bearing tree, suitable only for the fire. The Hebrew word for "bramble" occurs only here in this fable and in Psalm 58:9: "Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns [the bramble], whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!" Psalm 58 is an imprecatory psalm in which David prays that God would judge the wicked—someone like Abimelech. The final line of the psalm identifies the purpose of Jotham's curse: "Surely there is a God who judges on earth" (Ps. 58:11). The response of the bramble is unlike the three previous fruit trees'. The bramble accepts the offer of kingship, with a warning. If Israel has acted "in good faith" (truth) by making Abimelech king, then they will take refuge in his shade. But if not, then fire will break forth from the bramble and devour them.

<span id="page-595-6"></span><span id="page-595-5"></span><span id="page-595-4"></span>9:16–21 The interpretation of Jotham's fable follows. There is no reference to the three fruit-bearing trees; the focus is entirely on the bramble (Abimelech) and the cedars of Lebanon (those who installed Abimelech as king; Judg. 9:6). Jotham's interpretation implies that the leaders of Shechem have not acted in good faith (vv. 17–18)—but Jotham will not serve as judge. After delivering the fable and its interpretation he flees to Beer because of his brother (v. 21) and waits for the Lord to render his verdict. In the verses that follow fire will break forth from the bramble, consuming both the people and the bramble itself as God's judges their actions as "evil" (vv. 56–57).

<span id="page-595-10"></span><span id="page-595-7"></span>9:22 The account of Abimelech's reign begins here and runs through the end of the chapter, whereupon his death and the assessment of his actions are recorded. Abimelech's reign is short-lived at three years, covering the period from Jotham's curse to Abimelech's death—in other words, the events that follow occur during this three-year period of time. The word translated here as "ruled over" is not the same verb used in 8:22–23; 9:2, nor is it the standard Hebrew verb for kingship ("to reign, be king"). This particular verb occurs only six times in the OT (Num. 16:13 [2x]; Judg. 9:22; Isa. 32:1; Prov. 8:16; Est. 1:22), and its use here constitutes the author's tacit assessment of Abimelech's illicit reign.

<span id="page-595-12"></span><span id="page-595-11"></span><span id="page-595-8"></span><span id="page-595-3"></span><span id="page-595-2"></span><span id="page-595-0"></span>9:23–24 The Lord sets in motion the judgment of Abimelech and the "leaders" (or "baals"; cf. comment on 9:3–5) of Shechem by sending an evil spirit between them in order to incite hostility among them. The expression "evil spirit" occurs only here and at 1 Samuel 16:14, where it is sometimes translated "harmful spirit." Variations of this designation include "harmful [evil] spirit from God" and "harmful [evil] spirit from the Lord" (cf. 1 Sam. 16:15–16, 23; 18:10; 19:9), all of which occur in connection with Saul after he is rejected by the Lord as Israel's king. In the case both of Abimelech and of Saul the sending of the evil/harmful spirit begins a long, torturous process that leads to the corruption of the king's reign and the king's eventual death in battle. In this case the evil spirit has been sent because of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerubbaal. As such, the Lord stands as the avenger of blood among his people.

<span id="page-595-9"></span><span id="page-595-1"></span>9:25–29 Hostility toward Abimelech provokes the leaders of Shechem to set an ambush for him. While waiting they pillage passersby, making the land a place of oppression as in the days before Deborah (Judg. 5:6–7). The embodiment of the evil spirit from God comes in the form of Gaal, son of Ebed. In the midst of the grape harvest the people of Shechem, along with Gaal, feast in the house of their pagan god, Baal-berith. Perhaps emboldened by the wine, the people "revile" (or "curse") Abimelech. This incites Gaal to seize power by boasting in his willingness to remove Abimelech if the people will make him ruler.

<span id="page-596-7"></span><span id="page-596-6"></span><span id="page-596-1"></span><span id="page-596-0"></span>Gaal moves into the region of Shechem with his brothers and quickly garners the trust of its leaders. In verse 28 Gaal identifies himself with Hamor, father of Shechem, of the original Canaanite inhabitants of that city (Gen. 34:2). It is ironic that Gaal attempts to usurp Abimelech's rule with reference to his lineage — the exact strategy Abimelech employed when becoming king (Judg. 9:1–3). The reference to "his relatives" in verse 26 can also be rendered "his brothers," reminding us of the beginning of the narrative, in which Abimelech aligned himself with the people of Shechem ("because he is our brother"; v. 3) and then went out to murder "his brothers" (v. 5). This decay of familial fidelity plays out later, in the conclusion to the book, when the tribe of Benjamin teeters on the brink of extinction.

<span id="page-596-9"></span><span id="page-596-8"></span><span id="page-596-4"></span><span id="page-596-3"></span><span id="page-596-2"></span>9:30–33 It appears that a man named Zebul has charge of the city while Abimelech is away. In verse 28 Zebul was called "his officer," which could also be rendered "his overseer, administrator, leader, or representative," someone appointed to serve in a particular capacity on behalf of another.28 Here in verse 30 Zebul is described as "ruler of the city." The word for "ruler" is the nominal form of the verb used to describe Abimelech's rule in verse 22, strengthening the connection between the two. Zebul sends word to Abimelech after hearing the boast of Gaal. The word translated "secretly" occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible; its exact meaning is unknown. Some have suggested it means "deceitfully," with Zebul feigning allegiance with Gaal while sending messengers to Abimelech. Others have suggested the text should be emended to the proper noun "Arumah," which appears in verse 41 as the place in which Abimelech actually lives. The translation ambiguity does not dramatically impact the overall meaning or interpretation of the text. However, the nuance of deception is suggested by Zebul's later actions, as he deceives Gaal about the army of Abimelech streaming in ambush toward the city (v. 36).

<span id="page-596-14"></span><span id="page-596-13"></span><span id="page-596-11"></span>Zebul sends word to Abimelech that Gaal and his family have come to the city and are "stirring up" the inhabitants against him. This is the same verb used to describe an army encircling or besieging a city, as in 1 Samuel 23:8: "Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, *to besiege* David and his men." The use of this verb suggests the war between Gaal and Abimelech has already begun before the actual physical assault takes place. Zebul advises Abimelech to come and set an ambush at night, just as leaders of Shechem had schemed (Judg. 9:25).

<span id="page-596-12"></span><span id="page-596-10"></span><span id="page-596-5"></span>9:34–41 Following the plan of Zebul, Abimelech drives out Gaal and his family from Shechem. Abimelech's success is further aided by Zebul's deception of Gaal (v. 36), which allows Abimelech and his forces to reach the city before Gaal could rally his forces and mount a successful defense. The word translated "wounded" in verse 40 could also be rendered "slain," a severer outcome to the battle. The <span id="page-597-9"></span>reference to Abimelech's living in Arumah (v. 41) points to his unwelcome status in the town of his mother.

<span id="page-597-10"></span><span id="page-597-8"></span>9:42–45 Having driven out Gaal and his family from Shechem, Abimelech wages war with the inhabitants of the city. The text indicates that this occurs the very next day, implying that the people of the city go into the fields to continue the grape harvest (v. 27). This provides Abimelech with the opportunity to set another ambush. His forces divide into three companies, with the first cutting off access to the city gates so that the people cannot return and seek refuge in the city. The second two companies attack and kill the people of Shechem in the fields. The battle lasts all day. Abimelech kills the inhabitants, destroys the city, and sows it with salt. This would render the land infertile, a curse upon the land recalling God's warning for unfaithfulness to the covenant: "The whole land burned out with brimstone and salt, nothing sown and nothing growing, where no plant can sprout, an overthrow like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger and wrath" (Deut. 29:23).

Now we return to one particular event in the destruction of the city and the death of its inhabitants. A common feature in Hebrew narrative is to begin with a summary statement of a particular event and then to provide a more detailed account of that event, with particular focus on a significant or important feature. For example, in Genesis 1:1 it is recorded that God created all things invisible (the heavens) and visible (the earth; cf. Col. 1:16). Then in Genesis 1:2–31 the author narrates how God created the earth (the visible realm) in the space of six days. Then in Genesis 2:4–25 the author returns again to provide further details about the events of day six. And so by the end of Genesis 2 the events of day six have been presented three times, with increasing level of detail. Similarly here the author returns and provides further details of the events summarized in Judges 9:45. The focus of these verses presents the destruction of Shechem as the fulfillment of the curse of Jotham. The fire has come out of the bramble (Abimelech) and consumed the inhabitants of the city for their role in the murder of Gideon's seventy sons (9:15, 20).

<span id="page-597-14"></span><span id="page-597-13"></span><span id="page-597-7"></span><span id="page-597-6"></span><span id="page-597-5"></span><span id="page-597-2"></span>"Leaders [or "baals"; cf. comment on 9:3–5] of the Tower of Shechem" refers to the leaders who made Abimelech king and provided the resources for him to murder the seventy sons of Gideon. "El-berith" appears to be another name for Baal-berith, referenced in 8:33; 9:4. The word translated "stronghold" occurs three times in these verses and then only at 1 Samuel 13:6, where it is rendered "tombs": "The people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns." The term appears to refer to some sort of inner chamber, a refuge of last resort to hide from an enemy. In Judges 9:49 it is associated with the Tower of Shechem. Perhaps the pagan temple, the tower, and the inner chamber or stronghold constituted a single complex that served various cultic and military functions in the city. With the leaders of the city locked in the tower, Abimelech

devises a plan to burn down the stronghold with the inhabitants of the city in it. He and his army ascend Mount Zalmon, cut down tree branches, and use the wood to burn down the stronghold containing "about 1,000 men and women." The location of Mount Zalmon is unknown. Some have suggested that it represents another name for Mount Gerizim or Mount Ebal; it appears again only at Psalm 68:14. "Zalmon" means "shadow" or "darkness" and may hint at the nature of the dark events recorded in these verses.

<span id="page-598-9"></span><span id="page-598-3"></span><span id="page-598-1"></span>9:50–55 It is not revealed why Abimelech attacked Thebez after destroying Shechem. This section focuses instead on the nature of Abimelech's death as the anti-judge, or anti-king, of Judges. The battle at Thebez parallels that at Shechem in several ways. First, Abimelech captures the city, and its inhabitants take refuge in the city tower, this time on the roof. Second, Abimelech sets out to burn the tower with the inhabitants of the city inside, as at Shechem. This time, however, a woman hurls an upper millstone from the roof and crushes Abimelech's head. This is the second time a woman has crushed the head of a man in Judges (cf. 4:21–22). Once again we are reminded of the promise of God that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the Serpent and deliver God's people from the Enemy (Gen. 3:15). The Hebrew for "skull" (Judg. 9:53) also reminds us of the place of the crucifixion of Jesus: "And he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha" (John 19:17; cf. Matt. 27:33; Mark 15:22). The account of the death of Abimelech is the OT version of Golgotha, the place where his skull was crushed.

<span id="page-598-11"></span><span id="page-598-10"></span><span id="page-598-8"></span><span id="page-598-7"></span><span id="page-598-4"></span><span id="page-598-0"></span>As the anti-judge, or anti-king, of Judges, Abimelech in death shares features with Saul, another anti-king figure. For example, both Abimelech and Saul are injured in battle but request their armor bearer to kill them in order to avoid a more shameful death (1 Sam. 31:4). The Philistines remove the skull of Saul and post it in the temple of Dagon as an act of humiliation and subjugation (1 Chron. 10:10, there the word rendered "head" is the same for "skull" used in Judges 9:53). At the crucifixion of Jesus on Golgotha the sign above his head posted by Pilate reads "King of the Jews" (John 19:19). Abimelech and Saul are anti-king figures who die because of their sin (Judg. 9:56; 1 Chron. 10:13–14). Jesus is the true King, the seed of David, but he dies for our sins so that we might one day reign with him in the new heavens and the new earth.

<span id="page-598-12"></span><span id="page-598-6"></span><span id="page-598-5"></span><span id="page-598-2"></span>9:56–57 These final verses provide the theological assessment of the Abimelech narrative. First it is stated that God has "returned the evil of Abimelech" to him with regard to the murder of his brothers. God also has returned the evil of Shechem "on their heads" for making Abimelech king. The curse of Jotham has been fulfilled: "Let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech" (Judg. 9:20). Verse 56–57 both present God as the one who has brought about judgment in the land. He himself has avenged the innocent blood of the seventy sons of Jerubbaal.

#### *Response*

Abimelech is the anti-judge in the book of Judges. The Lord does not raise up this man. Abimelech raises up himself. He does not save Israel from the enemy. He is the enemy from whom Israel needs saving. He does not bring rest to the land but ravages it. The Abimelech narratives put on full display the inner corruption of Israel, which has been spreading like a virus since the days when Joshua and his generation died. In this lengthy account the author of Judges lingers over the corruption of Abimelech and the people of Shechem, a part of the whole, the leaven in the dough. This serves as a picture of life "under the sun" (Eccles. 1:9, 14), that is, life that rejects the kingship of the Lord and covenant living. Fratricide, betrayal, war, and death are the fruits of this life. This account serves as a warning to future generations, and so the apostle Paul warns us in 1 Corinthians 10:11–13:

<span id="page-599-2"></span><span id="page-599-1"></span>These things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.

### <span id="page-599-0"></span>JUDGES 10:1–5

10 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. **2**And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir.

After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years. And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.

#### *Section Overview*

In this section we encounter two more minor judges. They have been grouped together. In the first panel of judges (Othniel, Ehud, and Deborah/Barak) only Shamgar appeared between Ehud and Deborah/Barak. Now here Tola and Jair appear between Gideon/Abimelech and Jephthah. Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon will appear together as a group of three minor judges between Jephthah and Samson. There is an element of escalation in these groupings, from one to two to three. However, the reason for these groupings is unknown. The six minor judges, together with the six major judges, certainly represent the twelve tribes of Israel, but their placement in the book remains somewhat of a mystery. It is possible that they mark or introduce progressively climactic judge figures: Deborah/Barak, Jephthah, and Samson. However, this assessment excludes Gideon, who would certainly constitute a climactic figure in Judges.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-600-7"></span><span id="page-600-6"></span>10:1–2 Tola is the second minor judge in the book. He is from the tribe of Issachar but lives in Ephraim. Issachar's inheritance is located north of west Manasseh and south of Zebulun; Ephraim's is just south of west Manasseh.29 Verse 1 states that Tola rises up to "save Israel," but the text does not provide the name of the enemy, the length of subjugation, or the nature of the deliverance. In addition to Tola's name, the names of his father and grandfather, and his place of dwelling, the text only records the fact that he judges Israel for twenty-three years before dying and being buried in Shamir, that is, in Ephraim. A Tola is also listed in Genesis 46:13; Numbers 26:23; and 1 Chronicles 7:1.

<span id="page-600-8"></span><span id="page-600-5"></span><span id="page-600-1"></span><span id="page-600-0"></span>10:3–5 Jair the Gileadite is the third minor judge. Gilead is a region east of the Jordan, straddling Gad and east Manasseh. Jair judges Israel for twenty-two years before dying and being buried in Kamon. Between the record of his service as judge in Judges 9:3 and his death in 9:5 we find a curious statement regarding his thirty sons' riding thirty donkeys and having thirty cities. This implies a harem, significant wealth, and substantial influence in Gilead. Jair is also listed in Numbers 32:41 as a son of Manasseh with the account of his capturing and naming the thirty cities or villages. The word "Havvoth" is the feminine plural form of a Hebrew noun meaning "village," thus "villages of Jair" (cf. Deut. 3:14; Josh. 13:30).

The brief accounts of Tola and Jair remind us that God continues to save and deliver his people and to provide appropriate leadership in dark and difficult times. This series of judges also reminds us of the temporary nature of their role in the theocratic economy of God—judge after judge, king after king, until the one who will come and deliver God's people with one final victory, lasting for all of eternity. "He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself" (Heb. 9:26; cf. 7:27; 9:12; 10:10). When this one, Jesus, returns, he will reign forever (Rev. 11:15), and we will reign with him (Rev. 22:5).

**<sup>6</sup>**The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they forsook the Lord and did not serve him. **<sup>7</sup>** So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites, **<sup>8</sup>** and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. **9**And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.

**<sup>10</sup>**And the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, saying, "We have sinned against you, because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals." **11**And the Lord said to the people of Israel, "Did I not save you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines? **12**The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I saved you out of their hand. **13**Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more. **14**Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress." **15**And the people of Israel said to the Lord, "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day." **<sup>16</sup>** So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord, and he became impatient over the misery of Israel.

**<sup>17</sup>**Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah. **18**And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."

11 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was the father of Jephthah. **2**And Gilead's wife also bore him sons. And when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman." **3**Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, and worthless fellows collected around Jephthah and went out with him.

**<sup>4</sup>**After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel. **5**And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob. **6**And they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our leader, that we may fight against the Ammonites." **7**But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?" **8**And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That is why we have turned

**<sup>12</sup>**Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, "What do you have against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?" **13**And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel on coming up from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably." **<sup>14</sup>** Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites **<sup>15</sup>** and said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites, **16**but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. **<sup>17</sup>** Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let us pass through your land,' but the king of Edom would not listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.

**<sup>18</sup>** "Then they journeyed through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and arrived on the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab. **<sup>19</sup>** Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, 'Please let us pass through your land to our country,' **20**but Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel. **21**And the Lord, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country. **22**And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. **<sup>23</sup>** So then the Lord, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel; and are you to take possession of them? **24**Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all that the Lord our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess. **25**Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them? **26**While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, 300 years, why did you not deliver them within that time? **<sup>27</sup>** I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by making war on me. The Lord, the Judge, decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon." **28**But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent to him.

**<sup>29</sup>**Then the Spirit of the Lord was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites. **30**And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord and said, "If you will give the Ammonites into my hand, **<sup>31</sup>** then whatever*<sup>1</sup>* comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites shall be the Lord's, and I will offer

it*2* up for a burnt offering." **<sup>32</sup>** So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord gave them into his hand. **33**And he struck them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a great blow. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.

**34**Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah. And behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter. **35**And as soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot take back my vow." **36**And she said to him, "My father, you have opened your mouth to the Lord; do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the Lord has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites." **<sup>37</sup>** So she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my companions." **<sup>38</sup>** So he said, "Go." Then he sent her away for two months, and she departed, she and her companions, and wept for her virginity on the mountains. **39**And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow that he had made. She had never known a man, and it became a custom in Israel **<sup>40</sup>** that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.

12 The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire." **2**And Jephthah said to them, "I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand. **3**And when I saw that you would not save me, I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?" **4**Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh." **5**And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead said to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he said, "No," **<sup>6</sup>** they said to him, "Then say Shibboleth," and he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell.

**<sup>7</sup>** Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead.*<sup>3</sup>*

#### *Section Overview*

Jephthah is the fifth major judge in Judges. His account comes after those of two minor judges (Tola and Jair) and before those of three more (Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon). In total, six of Israel's judges are densely clustered in this section of the <span id="page-604-3"></span>book. When we meet Jephthah, he is introduced as the exiled son of a prostitute who has become a mighty warrior in the land of Tob (Judg. 11:1–3). The elders of Gilead bring Jephthah back from exile and make him leader of Gilead in order to bring an end to eighteen years of Ammonite oppression. At this point in time the Ammonites are attempting to dispossess the tribes of Israel living east of the Jordan, in the former territory of the Amorites. Jephthah will teach the Ammonites two things. First, he will provide them a history lesson (vv. 12–28); then he will school them in the art of war (vv. 29–33). Jephthah is most famous—or perhaps infamous, according to some interpreters—for the vow he makes and the consequences of that vow for his daughter.

<span id="page-604-7"></span><span id="page-604-6"></span><span id="page-604-4"></span><span id="page-604-1"></span>In terms of basic content, the account of Jephthah begins with an extended treatment of Israel's idolatry, subjugation, and repentance (10:6–16). Then the elders of Gilead make Jephthah their leader (11:1–11), and he defeats the Ammonites (vv. 12–33). Following the defeat of the Ammonites, Jephthah fulfills his vow (vv. 34–40). The account of Jephthah closes with a narrative flashback to a time prior to the fulfillment of the vow that records the Ephraimite rebellion and civil war. In terms of the basic focus of the narrative, the author provides extended details related to Israel's recurring idolatry (10:7–14), Jephthah's negotiation with the Ammonites (11:12–28), and the fulfillment of the vow (11:34–40).

<span id="page-604-5"></span><span id="page-604-2"></span>The author of the account has portrayed the relationship between Jephthah and Israel in a manner parallel to the relationship between the Lord and Israel. In other words, the account of Jephthah functions as something like a parable. In the beginning, Israel rejects Jephthah just as she has rejected the Lord. Then, when oppressed, Israel returns to the Lord and to Jephthah and asks for their help in deliverance from the Ammonites. The Lord and Jephthah deliver Israel from the oppression of the enemy at very great personal cost, only to have the people turn in rebellion against the one who has just delivered them. The account of Jephthah is an earthly parable portraying the heavenly reality of Israel's covenantal relationship with the Lord.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-604-0"></span>10:6 The fifth major judge account begins with the standard introductory formula: "The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord." What is <span id="page-605-14"></span>not standard, however, is the extent of Israel's idolatry as portrayed in this verse. The listing includes seven false gods from the nations surrounding Israel. Her idolatry has reached critical mass, here highlighted by the sevenfold list of false gods. She is whoring after these gods like an unfaithful wife with multiple illicit partners. Israel is the very picture of Gomer as presented in Hosea 1–3. The listing of seven gods in this verse contrasts with the faithfulness of the Lord presented in Judges 10:11–12, the Lord who has delivered Israel from the oppression of seven nations, beginning with the great deliverance from Egypt. The last sentence of the verse makes clear that the only god Israel is not worshiping is the one true God.

<span id="page-605-7"></span><span id="page-605-5"></span><span id="page-605-4"></span><span id="page-605-0"></span>10:7–9 Israel's sevenfold idolatry provokes the anger of the Lord, and he once again sells her into the hand of an enemy so that he might provoke repentance in his people. The two enemy nations listed, Philistia and Ammon, set the scene for the deliverance of Jephthah (defeating the Ammonites) and of Samson (defeating the Philistines). The oppression of the Ammonites lasts eighteen years before the people of God cry out to him for help. The center of Ammonite oppression is located east of the Jordan ("beyond the Jordan"; v. 8). Gilead is identified as the specific location (cf. Numbers 32), which hints at the coming of Jephthah, since he is "Jephthah the Gileadite" (Judg. 11:1). Jair, the third minor judge, was also identified as a Gileadite (cf. comment on 10:3–5). It is also recorded how the Ammonite oppression pushes across the Jordan into the west, impacting Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. At the end of the Jephthah narrative the tribe of Ephraim will oppose Jephthah, resulting in a tragic civil war and the deaths of forty-two thousand Ephraimites (12:1–7).

<span id="page-605-13"></span><span id="page-605-11"></span><span id="page-605-10"></span><span id="page-605-6"></span><span id="page-605-2"></span>10:10 The account of Israel's repentance receives special attention in this particular judge narrative. It begins here in Judges 10:10 and runs all the way through 10:16, where it is recorded how Israel puts away the foreign gods among her and returns to worshiping the Lord. Sandwiched between the statement of Israel's repentance in verse 10 and the action of her repentance in verse 16 is a brief word from the Lord depicting the severity of Israel's recurring idolatry. The statement that Israel "served the Baals" is simply a generic reference to all of the false gods mentioned in verse 6.

<span id="page-605-12"></span><span id="page-605-9"></span><span id="page-605-8"></span><span id="page-605-3"></span><span id="page-605-1"></span>10:11–14 It is unknown how the Lord communicates with his people at this point. We can only assume that he sends a prophet or prophetess among them to deliver his word, someone like Deborah (ch. 4). The word begins with the Lord's recounting his constant faithfulness to deliver his people in the past. In 10:11–12 the Lord lists seven nations from whom he has delivered his people, beginning with Egypt. We know from a later statement of Jephthah (11:26) that three hundred years have passed since the exodus event and Israel's occupation of the region east of the Jordan. As such, the Lord has provided a three-hundred-year track record of his faithfulness to deliver his people in their time of need. This record of the Lord's faithfulness is contrasted with the statement of Israel's covenant infidelity in 10:13 and the decision of the Lord no longer to save his people but rather to give them over to the gods they have chosen to worship. In other words, the Lord is informing Israel that the sevenfold nature of her idolatry has exhausted the sevenfold nature of his deliverance. It is now time to allow Israel to reap the fruit of disobedience. The resulting condition of Israel's idolatry is expressed well in Isaiah 42:17:

<span id="page-606-8"></span> They are turned back and utterly put to shame, who trust in carved idols, who say to metal images, "You are our gods."30

<span id="page-606-6"></span><span id="page-606-3"></span>10:15–16 The people of Israel respond with a second confession of sin and submission to the will of God. This confession of sin follows with the statement that Israel does in fact rid herself of these foreign gods and return to the Lord God in worship. Finally, this section ends with a statement describing the Lord as "impatient over the misery of Israel." The Hebrew idiom for "he became impatient" could be rendered woodenly as "his soul became short." The same idiom appears later in the Samson narratives, when Delilah repeatedly presses Samson to tell her the secret of his strength; there it is rendered "his soul was vexed" (Judg. 16:16; cf. Num. 21:4; Zech. 11:8). This second rendering well captures the inner conflict between justice and mercy, between saving Israel again (mercy) and giving them over to their sin (justice). This is a conflict resolved ultimately at the cross, where the justice of God is poured out in wrath on sin and his mercy comes as he is the one who bears that sin on his people's behalf. The resolution of this conflict is nothing less than the good news of the gospel.

<span id="page-606-5"></span><span id="page-606-4"></span><span id="page-606-2"></span><span id="page-606-1"></span><span id="page-606-0"></span>10:17–18 The Ammonites set up camp in Gilead, while the Israelites set up camp in Mizpah, which is also in Gilead (cf. Judg. 11:11, 29).31 The Hebrew verb translated "were called to arms" is the same verb used in 10:10 when Israel "cried out" to the Lord, and it is used again in 10:15 when the Lord commanded Israel to "cry out" for help to the false gods she had been worshiping. The repetition of this verbal root in the introduction to the Jephthah narrative identifies an important truth that can be missed in translation. When the enemy cries out against God's people, the only true path of rescue is to cry out to the one true God. This time, however, the Lord puts the false gods of Israel's worship to the test by allowing Israel the opportunity to call upon her idols to deliver her from the enemy:

When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you!

The wind will carry them all off,

a breath will take them away.

But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land

and shall inherit my holy mountain.

After eighteen years of oppression, with no relief in sight, the people of Israel now understand that only the Lord can truly save them from the enemy.

This chapter comes to an end with the leaders of Gilead looking for someone to begin the fight against the Ammonites. This person they will make the leader (lit., "head") over all of Gilead. The specific focus on Gilead and the Transjordan reminds us that the judge narratives depict largely regional and perhaps overlapping areas of deliverance and years of service. The purpose of Judges is not a strict historical, chronological account of the period of the judges but a selection of narratives that faithfully record Israel's decline into sin and the rejection of the Lord as her King—the un-creation of Israel. However, what is recorded in part is largely true of the whole, and each individual narrative repeatedly portrays the nation of Israel as unfaithful to her covenant with the Lord, in contrast to the faithfulness of the Lord in spite of Israel's infidelity. This is a picture of the steadfast love of the Lord that is such an important theme in all Scripture. The believer must always remember that the Lord does not treat his people as their sins deserve, for he took upon himself the punishment of their sins (Ps. 25:7): "He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities" (Ps. 103:10).

<span id="page-607-8"></span><span id="page-607-7"></span><span id="page-607-1"></span><span id="page-607-0"></span>11:1 In Judges 10:18 the leaders of Gilead posed the question, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites?" Judges 11:1 provides the answer: Jephthah is the man. The text provides important background information regarding him. First, he is a "mighty warrior." This is a positive description and explains why the leaders of Gilead desire Jephthah to return and help defeat the Ammonites. Other OT figures are similarly characterized: David (1 Samuel 16:18); Kish, the father of Saul (1 Samuel 9:1); Jeroboam (1 Kings 11:28); Naaman, the general of Aram (2 Kings 5); and Boaz (Ruth 2:1).

<span id="page-607-6"></span><span id="page-607-5"></span><span id="page-607-4"></span><span id="page-607-3"></span>Second, Jephthah is the "son of a prostitute." At first glance this might appear to be a negative assessment. Perhaps it alludes to the birth of Abimelech, the son of Gideon's concubine from another town. But Boaz was the son of Rahab the prostitute (Matt. 1:5; cf. Ruth 4:21), and no one thinks any less of him. In fact, this fact makes Boaz's fulfillment of the law of the kinsman-redeemer that much more remarkable, especially since Ruth was a Moabitess. This is just the type of person the Bible loves to showcase. The Lord loves to make his power and grace known by going after the unexpected, least likely, or most unqualified candidate. Sometimes it is the younger brother (Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David), the barren woman (Sarah, Rebekah, Hannah, Elizabeth), the unloved wife (Leah), or the unqualified servant (Moses, David). When the Bible introduces a character and mentions a flaw or weakness in that character, we should be prepared to see God at work (2 Cor. 12:9).

<span id="page-607-9"></span><span id="page-607-2"></span>Finally, it is recorded that Gilead was the father of Jephthah. Jephthah was a true Gileadite and so belonged to Gilead as a son and brother. The author of the narratives describes Gilead's other sons as "*his* brothers" (Judg. 11:3), but his <span id="page-608-8"></span>brothers distance themselves from him by referring to Gilead as "*our* father" (11:2). These facts set us up for the upcoming parable of Jephthah.

<span id="page-608-9"></span><span id="page-608-7"></span><span id="page-608-1"></span><span id="page-608-0"></span>11:2–3 These verses continue to provide important information for understanding the upcoming events in chapters 11–12. It is recorded that the sons of Gilead's wife drove out Jephthah from the land of Gilead due to greed. They did not want to share their inheritance with the son of a prostitute. So Jephthah left the land of Gilead and lived in the land of Tob, where "worthless fellows" joined up with him. The word here translated "worthless" means "empty," as in "empty pit" (Gen. 37:24) or "empty jars" (Judg. 7:16). In Judges 9:4 Abimelech hired "worthless [or "empty"] and reckless fellows." In contexts such as 9:4 or here, the designation "empty" is best understood as "unattached" or "empty" with regard to social connection—these are soldiers or mercenaries for hire. Since Jephthah is a mighty warrior, it makes sense that other such warriors would gather to him. There is safety in numbers, especially if one has just been rejected and sent away by one's family. As the narrative progresses, the people of Israel deal with Jephthah on earth how they have dealt with God in heaven. The reject him, cry out to him to save them, repent and make him head over them, and then, in the end, turn on him after having been delivered. The cycle continues—as on earth, so in heaven. The narrative of Jephthah is something of a parable, and it puts on display the ongoing corruption of Israel. In the end, for Jephthah to deliver Israel will cost him his only child. The parabolic nature of the account is the intentional design of the author, not an accident.

<span id="page-608-10"></span><span id="page-608-6"></span><span id="page-608-5"></span>11:4–6 Judges 11:4 takes us back to 10:17, in which the Ammonites encamped in Gilead in preparation for battle. Judges 11:5–6 take us to 10:18, in which the leaders of Gilead looked for "the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites." The text does not state how the leaders of Gilead decide upon Jephthah or even if they have other options. We simply read that they go to Tob to ask for Jephthah's help. The brother they once rejected is sought after for help in their time of need after eighteen years of oppression. They are desperate and so now repent of their rejection of Jephthah and promise to make him the one who rules over them. The parable continues!

<span id="page-608-15"></span><span id="page-608-14"></span><span id="page-608-13"></span><span id="page-608-12"></span><span id="page-608-11"></span><span id="page-608-4"></span><span id="page-608-3"></span><span id="page-608-2"></span>11:7–10 The dialogue recorded in these four verses appears to be something of a negotiation, or at least the means by which Jephthah confirms the truthful intentions of the elders. In verses 7 and 9 Jephthah questions the elders of Gilead, and in verses 8 and 10 the elders respond. Jephthah's first question is intended to remind the elders of their past mistreatment of him, echoing the words of the Lord in 10:13–14: "You have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more. Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress." The response of the elders (11:8) corresponds to Israel's response to the Lord in 10:15: "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day." Jephthah's second inquiry (11:9) makes an important connection: the one who delivers is the one who leads. In 10:11–12 the

Lord rehearsed his sevenfold deliverance of his people over a period of some three hundred years, but the people still reject him as God and King. Will Israel reject Jephthah as they have the Lord? In desperation, the elders of Gilead respond in earnest and call the Lord to serve as witness to this promise ("The Lord will be the one who hears between us"; AT).

<span id="page-609-7"></span><span id="page-609-6"></span><span id="page-609-5"></span><span id="page-609-0"></span>11:11 This section concludes with Jephthah again in Gilead, this time as "head and leader" over the people, reversing the events previously recorded (v. 3). The reference to Jephthah's speaking "all his words before the Lord" refers to the previous dialogue (vv. 9–10). Jephthah rehearses the obligations of verse 9, and the Lord "hears" these words and so serves as the witness to the oath and pledge. A similar type of oath between Jacob and Laban occurred in this location hundreds of years prior and is the reason for the name of the location ("Mizpah"). In Genesis 31 Laban invokes God as witness, as the one who "sees" or "watches" when no one else is looking; "Therefore he named it Galeed, and *Mizpah*, for he said, 'The Lord *watch*  between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight'" (Gen. 31:48–49). Mizpah means "watchtower" and is an apt symbol of witness and a subtle Hebrew play on words.

<span id="page-609-11"></span><span id="page-609-9"></span><span id="page-609-8"></span><span id="page-609-1"></span>11:12–13 As the new leader and head of Gilead, Jephthah sets out to deal with the Ammonite threat. This is the very reason the elders of Gilead brought him back from exile in Tob. He begins by negotiating with the Ammonites (Judg. 11:12–28). The first round of negotiations appears in verses 12–13; the second round of negotiations is much longer (vv. 14–28). In this first round Jephthah begins by asking a simple question: "What do you have against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?" In response the Ammonites accuse Israel of wrongfully taking their land when Israel came out of Egypt approximately three hundred years ago. The Ammonites are now demanding it be returned to them in peace. In the response that follows, Jephthah presents his case that the Israelites are the lawful inhabitants of the disputed region. His review of Israel's history is impressive and relies heavily on information recorded in Numbers 20–22 and Deuteronomy 2–3 (cf. esp. Num. 20:14–21; 21:13–26, 31–35; Deut. 2:24–3:17).

<span id="page-609-10"></span><span id="page-609-4"></span><span id="page-609-3"></span>11:14–15 Jephthah sends messengers to the king of the Ammonites a second time in order to substantiate Israel's legitimate possession of the disputed region and to repudiate the Ammonite claim that Israel wrongfully took territory. The use of the introductory messenger formula "Thus says Jephthah" is striking, echoing the formula commonly used by biblical prophets to introduce divine speech: "Thus says the Lord" (cf. Ex. 4:22). This is yet another device employed by the author to portray Jephthah as the instrument of the Lord in his service as Israel's judge and deliverer. Jephthah's thesis appears at the end of Judges 11:15: "Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites."

<span id="page-609-13"></span><span id="page-609-12"></span><span id="page-609-2"></span>11:16–18 Jephthah begins to defend his thesis by rehearsing Israel's journey from Egypt to the Red Sea, from the Red Sea to Kadesh, and then through the wilderness around Edom and Moab until arriving at the north bank of the Arnon. The Arnon River is the northern border of Moab, and thus Israel did not enter into the land of Moab.32 This review demonstrates that the people of Israel did not take or occupy any land that the Lord had not given to them as their inheritance. The role of Moab and its border appears again in verses 25–26.

<span id="page-610-11"></span><span id="page-610-9"></span><span id="page-610-8"></span><span id="page-610-7"></span><span id="page-610-6"></span><span id="page-610-0"></span>11:19–23 In this next section of his defense Jephthah rehearses how Israel came to take possession of the land of the Amorites, the land north of Moab allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and east Manasseh. This was the land of Sihon, the Amorite king who came out against Israel in war when the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel. Israel then possessed her land, "all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan" (v. 22). The point of this rehearsal is to verify and validate that it was the Lord who gave this land to Israel (v. 21) and that it was the Lord who dispossessed the Amorites (v. 23). The land of the Amorites was not the same as that of the Ammonites. For example, Numbers 21:24 records, "Israel defeated [Sihon] with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong" (cf. Deut. 2:31–36). Israel did not enter, occupy, or possess any Ammonite territory but only the land of the Amorites up to the border of Ammon. That border was "strong," meaning secure. In Deuteronomy 2:37 it is also recorded that the Lord did not permit the Israelites to occupy Ammonite territory: "Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the Lord our God had forbidden us."

<span id="page-610-13"></span><span id="page-610-10"></span><span id="page-610-5"></span><span id="page-610-4"></span><span id="page-610-3"></span><span id="page-610-1"></span>11:24 Jephthah now makes the theological argument that nations possess what has been divinely allotted to them (cf. Deut. 32:8–9). The reference to Chemosh as the god of the Ammonites has caused some discussion. Chemosh is normally referred to as the god of the Moabites (Num. 21:29), with Milcom being the god of the Ammonites (1 Kings 11:5, 7, 33). Perhaps the prominence of Moab in Jephthah's argument below explains this reference. Or he could be referring to the land under dispute, the land formerly associated with Chemosh before being occupied by Israel. Some argue that Jephthah's mention of Chemosh implies syncretism on his part. However, such an interpretation is not required. Jephthah is simply speaking in terms that the unnamed Ammonite king would understand. The prophets frequently make reference to other so-called gods without ever being accused of syncretism.

<span id="page-610-12"></span><span id="page-610-2"></span>11:25–26 Jephthah follows with a reference to Balak, king of Moab when Israel came out of Egypt (cf. Numbers 22–24; Josh. 24:9; Mic. 6:5; Rev. 2:14). This is an argument of comparison: "Are you any better?" The point is that Moab's king did not dispute Israel's claim to the Amorite territory and that the Ammonites are not greater than the Moabites. Additionally, if the Ammonites did have a claim

<sup>32</sup> For the location of the Arnon River and the territory under discussion in Jephthah's review cf. ibid.

on the former region of the Amorites, why has it taken three hundred years to make such a claim?

Jephthah has argued that Israel did not take away the land of the Moabites to the south or the land of the Ammonites to the north and east. Israel circumvented Moabite territory, disposed the Amorites alone, and did not enter into or occupy any Ammonite territory. Finally, no previous Ammonite king has come to make a claim on this land in the three hundred years of its occupation. These verses bring the defense of Jephthah's thesis to a conclusion, and he now stands ready to deliver his verdict.

<span id="page-611-6"></span><span id="page-611-0"></span>11:27–28 The conclusion of Jephthah's case against the Ammonites comprises three parts. First, he declares himself (and so also Israel by representation) innocent of any wrong. This is stated in the negative: "I therefore have not sinned against you." Second, he accuses the unnamed Ammonite king of wrongdoing: "You do me wrong by making war on me." The word translated as "wrong" is the same word used repeatedly in Judges to characterize Israel's idolatry and translated as "evil" (e.g., 2:11; "And the people of Israel did what was *evil* in the sight of the Lord"). The connection between the word for "sin" in the first part of the statement and the word for "evil" or "wrong" in the second is intentional. The third and final part of Jephthah's verdict represents a theological highpoint in Judges. This is the declaration that the Lord himself is the one true Judge: "The Lord, the Judge, decide this day." The verb rendered "decide" is the verb "to judge" that appears frequently in Judges (seventeen times). Though perhaps repetitive in English, this could be rendered "The Lord, the [one true] Judge, will judge!" Once again, the judges raised up by the Lord understand their authority in subordination to him as his instrument of deliverance. It is the Lord who *saves* (2:18). It is the Lord who *rules* over his people (8:23). It is the Lord who is the one true *Judge* (11:27). The message of the book could not be any clearer. Unfortunately, the king of the Ammonites does not learn this lesson but makes the mistake of engaging the Lord and his people in battle.

<span id="page-611-8"></span><span id="page-611-7"></span><span id="page-611-5"></span><span id="page-611-4"></span><span id="page-611-1"></span>11:29 This next section (vv. 29–33) records Jephthah's swift defeat of the Ammonites and the vow he makes. The section begins with the statement that the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah. The second introduction to the book stated that "whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge" (2:18). This promise of the divine presence comes as the enabling power of the Spirit of the Lord, whose presence underscores that the Lord had indeed raised up Jephthah to deliver his people. The enabling presence of the Spirit has come upon Othniel (3:10), Gideon (6:34), and now Jephthah. The presence of the Spirit of the Lord will play a major role in the life of Samson as well (13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14). This verse concludes by tracing the route used by Jephthah to engage the Ammonites in battle.

<span id="page-611-12"></span><span id="page-611-11"></span><span id="page-611-10"></span><span id="page-611-9"></span><span id="page-611-3"></span><span id="page-611-2"></span>11:30–31 Jephthah's vow comprises two parts: the condition (v. 30) and its consequence (v. 31). The first part is the condition (protasis). Jephthah will fulfill his <span id="page-612-4"></span><span id="page-612-3"></span><span id="page-612-2"></span><span id="page-612-0"></span>vow if the Lord will indeed give the Ammonites into his hand. The language here recalls Jephthah's interaction with the elders of Gilead in verse 9: "If you bring me home again to fight against the Ammonites, *and the Lord gives them over to me*, [then] I will be your head." The second part of Jephthah's vow is the consequence (apodosis). Jephthah vows to offer up to the Lord "whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me" as a whole burnt offering (an offering completely consumed by fire on the altar). The clause "whatever comes out" could also be rendered "*whoever* comes out" (ESV mg.). It is not likely that Jephthah expects an animal or some inanimate object to come out and greet him. When men returned from war, it was usually women who went out to greet them (Ex. 15:20; Judg. 5:28; 1 Sam. 18:6). But this does not mean that Jephthah intends to engage in the abomination of human sacrifice (Deut. 12:31; 18:9–12), as the Ammonites did in their worship of Molech (Lev. 18:21; 20:2–5; 2 Kings 23:13; Jer. 32:35). Rather, it is best to understand the language of sacrifice employed by Jephthah to be symbolic.33 Sacrificial language in general, in both the OT and the NT, may be used symbolically to characterize something offered to the Lord. For example, in Psalm 51:17 a "broken and contrite heart" is the sacrifice the Lord desires. And in Romans 12:1 Paul admonishes believers to offer their bodies as living sacrifices to the Lord, an act of spiritual worship. Thus it is possible, and more likely probable, that Jephthah is using the language of sacrifice symbolically for complete and total dedication to the Lord. It is also important to remember that Jephthah makes this vow in the context of the Spirit's coming upon him to deliver Israel. The symbolic nature and the fulfillment of the vow is explained further in the comments on 11:37–40.

<span id="page-612-10"></span><span id="page-612-9"></span><span id="page-612-8"></span><span id="page-612-6"></span><span id="page-612-1"></span>11:32–33 The record of the battle with the Ammonites and of Jephthah's victory is very brief and general in terms of description. The author appears to be more interested in the nature and consequences of Jephthah's vow in the verses that follow. The text simply states that Jephthah engages the Ammonites in battle and that the Lord gives them into his hand. Once again the text is clear that when the judge engages the enemy in battle, it is the Lord by the power of his Spirit who achieves victory for his people. This victory is called a "great blow" for the Ammonites, one that results in their humiliation and submission to the people of Israel.

11:34 The condition of Jephthah's vow has been met. The Lord has given the Ammonites into the hand of Jephthah, who has returned to his house in peace. It is now time to fulfill the vow. Upon his return, Jephthah's daughter comes out of the house to meet him. The language of the first half of this verse draws upon the language of Jephthah's vow in the first part of Judg. 11:31. The verbs "to go out" and "to meet" and the noun "house" are repeated in order to connect the events in verse 34 to the vow recorded in verse 31. Jephthah's daughter will be offered

<span id="page-612-7"></span><span id="page-612-5"></span><sup>33</sup> For a book length treatment of Jephthah's vow and its fulfillment in a symbolic manner cf. David Marcus, *Jephthah and His Vow* (Lubbock, TX: Texas Tech Press, 1986). Cf. also Solomon Landers, "Did Jephthah Kill His Daughter?," *Bible Review* 7/4 (August 1991): 29–31, 42. For additional exegetical evidence supporting this view cf. Gordon P. Hugenberger's upcoming commentary on the book of Judges, ApOTC (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, forthcoming).

<span id="page-613-0"></span>as the vowed "burnt offering." The second half of this verse describes the special status of Jephthah's daughter: "She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter." The word translated "only child" is an adjective occurring only twelve times in the OT. The only other person described in this way is Isaac (Gen. 22:2, 12, 16). The similarity in context is both striking and intentional. For example, God commanded Abraham to "take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you" (Gen. 22:2). Isaac is described as Abraham's "only son" (in spite of Ishmael), and Abraham is to offer him up as a "burnt offering." The exact same language appears in Judges 11, and both events find fulfillment in a nonliteral manner. The point is the parable: Jephthah's story is that of God and Israel, and for God to save his people it will one day cost the life of his only child.

<span id="page-613-4"></span><span id="page-613-3"></span><span id="page-613-2"></span>11:35–36 Jephthah responds to the presence of his daughter with sorrow and grief, as evidenced by the tearing of his clothes. The verb translated "you have brought me very low" is the same verb used to describe Jephthah's defeat of the Ammonites, rendered "were subdued" (v. 33). As such, the loss of the Ammonites costs Jephthah the loss of his daughter, and the "great blow" (v. 33) of the Ammonites has become the "great trouble" of Jephthah. The extent of Jephthah's grief corresponds to his commitment to keep the vow he has made to the Lord. Even more surprising, however, is the willingness of his daughter to fulfill the vow of her father. Her willingness is yet another argument against the literal fulfillment of the vow.

<span id="page-613-6"></span><span id="page-613-5"></span>11:37–38 The daughter's request hints at the nature of the vow's fulfillment. She asks for time to weep not for her life but for her virginity. Yes, as a virgin, death would prevent marriage and the opportunity to raise a family. But the prospect of marriage in the face of death as a whole burnt offering seems to miss the gravity of situation. If death by sacrifice were really the issue, the request for two months would provide a good head start on running away from home. The issue of virginity, however, explicitly appears in verses 37, 38, and 39. Never once is death or an actual sacrifice ever mentioned. Not only are such sacrifices clearly forbidden and abominated in Scripture (Deut. 12:31; 18:9–12; cf. 2 Kings 3:27; 23:10; Isa. 57:5), but the focus of the text is repeatedly virginity, not death. Jephthah's daughter weeps because she will never experience the joy of being a bride in this life.

<span id="page-613-8"></span><span id="page-613-7"></span><span id="page-613-1"></span>11:39 After two months Jephthah's daughter willingly returns to him so that he might fulfill his vow. The nature of the fulfillment is described in the second half of the verse with a disjunctive, epexegetical clause that should be translated "*In other words*, she did not know a man." Again, the issue is virginity, not death. The text does not provide us with the exact nature of the vow's fulfillment. It appears, however, that Jephthah's vow consists of offering a member of his house <span id="page-614-0"></span>to full-time service of the Lord and thus not to the normal duties of a household, such as marriage or childbearing. Service of this type is documented in the OT (Ex. 38:8; 1 Sam. 1:11, 22–28; 2:22). If Jephthah had in fact slaughtered his daughter as a burnt offering in order to fulfill his vow to the Lord, it is hard to conceive of the author of Hebrews allowing his name to stand in the great hall of faith recorded in Hebrews 11.

<span id="page-614-10"></span><span id="page-614-4"></span><span id="page-614-2"></span><span id="page-614-1"></span>11:40 Verse 39 concluded with the statement that "it became a custom in Israel."34 This custom is now described. "Year by year" (or "from days to days") for four days the daughters of Israel would go to "lament" the daughter of Jephthah. The text does not tell us where they went. The precise meaning of the verb rendered "lament" is disputed. In 5:11 it is translated "repeat," as in, "They repeat the righteous triumphs of the Lord." The nuance of "repeat," "rehearse," or "commemorate" also suits the context of chapter 11, so that the text could be stating, "Each year the daughters of Israel would go to commemorate [or "console"] the daughter of Jephthah."35 If the daughter were serving at the tabernacle, the daughters of Israel may have gone to visit her each year for four days as an act of kindness as she fulfilled her father's vow. Though this is described here as an annual custom, there is no other record or account of its being carried out. Perhaps the custom came to an end with the death of Jephthah's daughter many years later, as the need to visit or commemorate her would no longer be necessary.

<span id="page-614-9"></span><span id="page-614-7"></span><span id="page-614-6"></span>12:1 The Jephthah narrative comes to an end with the account of Ephraim's rebellion and the ensuing civil war (vv. 1–6), followed by the formulaic death notice of the judge (v. 7). After Jephthah defeats the Ammonites and delivers Israel, the men of Ephraim cross over to the eastern side of the Jordan to meet Jephthah at Zaphon, in the territory of Gad.36 The parable of Jephthah continues. He has delivered Israel from the oppression of the enemy at the cost of his only daughter, merely to have the people (represented by Ephraim) respond with infidelity and violence. The complaint is that Jephthah did not summon the Ephraimites to participate in the battle against the Ammonites; in response they threaten Jephthah with death by fire. The reference to his house links to the events of chapter 11, in which Jephthah made his vow concerning the one who would come out of his house to meet him. In chapter 11 Jephthah's house produced "great trouble" and suffering. Here in chapter 12 his house, probably including the entire household, comes under the threat of complete destruction.

<span id="page-614-8"></span><span id="page-614-5"></span><span id="page-614-3"></span>12:2–3 Jephthah's first response to the Ephraimite threat is diplomacy, the same tactic employed against the Ammonites in 11:12–27. He sets the record straight by arguing that the Ephraimites are incorrect in their assessment of the situation. Jephthah did in fact summon the Ephraimites into battle, but they did not answer the summons. As such, Ephraim has wronged Jephthah and the warriors of Gilead.

35 For additional translation options cf. ibid., 35–36; Landers, "Did Jephthah Kill His Daughter?," 42.

<sup>34</sup> The Hebrew may also be translated "she became an example in Israel" (Marcus, *Jephthah and His Vow*, 34).

<sup>36</sup> For the location of Zaphon cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 112, map 4.20.

Jephthah could lodge a countercomplaint against Ephraim, but instead he simply notes that the Lord has given the enemy into his hand. This reference to the Lord's agency in victory should abate the anger of the Ephraimites, but it does not. Civil war ensues—a precursor to the events recorded in chapters 19–21 (the civil war against the tribe of Benjamin).

<span id="page-615-5"></span><span id="page-615-3"></span><span id="page-615-2"></span><span id="page-615-1"></span><span id="page-615-0"></span>12:4–6 Jephthah and the men of Gilead engage in battle with the men of Ephraim. The Ephraimites taunt the Gileadites with the epithet "fugitives of Ephraim" (v. 4). However, the Gileadites prevail and strike down the Ephraimites. In order to prevent escape, the Gileadites capture the fords of the Jordan and turn the tables on the Ephraimites, a tactic employed by Ehud in 3:28. The Ephraimites have now become the literal "fugitives of Ephraim" (v. 5), and Jephthah will put them to the test. In order to determine whether someone coming to the crossing point of the Jordan is an Ephraimite, he is told to say the Hebrew word "Shibboleth," meaning either "ear of corn" or "flood of water." The meaning of the word, however, is not important—it is its pronunciation that matters. If the person responds with the pronunciation "Sibboleth," he is identified as an Ephraimite and put to death. This dialectal test is rather ingenious and certainly makes sense in light of modern analogies. For example, the pronunciation of English varies between America, Canada, England, and Australia. Even within the United States, regional dialects distinguish places of origin. As a result, both in the initial battle and at the crossing point of the Jordan, Ephraim suffers a great loss: the tragic death of forty-two thousand men.

<span id="page-615-4"></span>12:7 The Jephthah narrative now comes to an end with the formulaic report of his death after judging Israel six years. The duration of his service is comparatively short but accords well with the three minor judges who immediately follow, with durations of service recorded at seven, ten, and eight years.

#### *Response*

The account of Jephthah portrays the relationship between Jephthah and Israel as a type or parable of the relationship between Israel and the Lord. Israel's illicit idolatry and rejection of the Lord parallels the unjust rejection of Jephthah by his brothers. Israel's repentance and return to the Lord and Jephthah comes only as a last resort after almost two decades of oppression at the hands of the Ammonites. Both the Lord and Jephthah, by the power of Spirit, defeat the Ammonites and deliver Israel from the enemy by achieving victory in battle. Finally, Israel turns on Jephthah after he gains victory for his people in the same way in which Israel will again turn on the Lord and whore after the idols of the nations around them. The focus on Jephthah's vow and his commitment to fulfilling that vow serves as another picture of the Lord. The Lord has vowed that Israel would be his people, and Lord is completely faithful to that vow, even at great personal cost to himself. In faithfulness to the covenant the Lord delivers Israel once again, knowing full well that they will soon turn away and forget him, their King and Savior.

But we know the rest of the story too. The Lord will also keep the "vow of Jephthah" at the appointed time in the distant future. He too will offer his only child as a sacrifice in order to achieve final and ultimate victory for his people. The daughter of Jephthah weeps because she will never experience the joy of being a bride in this life. The son of God weeps in order that we, along with Jephthah's daughter, might know the joy of being his bride for all eternity. Jephthah is a witness, among a great cloud of witnesses in the OT, to the Father's great salvation in Christ for us. This account serves as a warning to put away all that hinders and cling to the Lord in faith. We do not want to have the fickle, betraying heart of Israel recorded here. Rather, by faith, we must embrace the words of Hebrews 12:1–2:

<span id="page-616-4"></span>Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, *looking to Jesus*, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.

### <span id="page-616-3"></span>JUDGES 12:8–15

**<sup>8</sup>**After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. **9**He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. **10**Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.

**<sup>11</sup>**After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. **12**Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.

**<sup>13</sup>**After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. **14**He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years. **15**Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-616-2"></span><span id="page-616-1"></span><span id="page-616-0"></span>The final three minor judges are clustered together, likely expressing some sort of escalation or climax. First in the book was Shamgar alone (Judg. 3:31), followed by Tola and Jair in a group of two (10:1–5), and now Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon as three. Since Samson is the final, climactic judge in the book, this grouping of three minor judges prepares us to read the Samson account as the conclusion to the judge accounts that began with Othniel at 3:7. In terms of basic content, the

author of the book has recorded certain details regarding these judges' families but not information related to enemy oppression or victory in battle. Sons, daughters, marriage, grandchildren, and donkeys distinguish these judges as wealthy men with large families.

### *Section Outline*

II.B.6. Ibzan (12:8–10; minor) II.B.7. Elon (12:11–12; minor) II.B.8. Abdon (12:13–15; minor)

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-617-2"></span><span id="page-617-1"></span>12:8–10 Ibzan is from Bethlehem of Judah. Like Jair (10:4), Ibzan has thirty sons. But he also has thirty daughters. He gives his daughters in marriage outside of his clan and brings in wives for his sons in the same way. He judges Israel for only seven years before his death.

<span id="page-617-3"></span><span id="page-617-0"></span>12:11–12 The account Elon is brief, second only to that of Shamgar (3:31). The author has recorded only his tribe, Zebulun, and the location of his grave, Aijalon. Elon judges Israel for ten years before his death, the longest term for these final three minor judges.

<span id="page-617-4"></span>12:13–15 The account of Abdon parallels those of Jair and Ibzan with regard to the presentation of family information. He is from the tribe of Ephraim and the clan of Pirathon and is the son of Hillel. If Samson is presented as the sixth and climactic major judge, then Abdon is presented as the sixth and climactic minor judge. The numbers tell the story. He has more sons ("forty"), grandsons ("thirty"), and donkeys ("seventy") than does any other judge. These numbers and the recorded details seem to represent the author's literary strategy for marking narrative climax.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-617-5"></span>Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon remind us of the faithfulness of God to his people to raise up leaders who promote love and obedience to their covenant Lord and provide relief from the subjugation and oppression of the enemy. These judges also prepare us for Samson as the last and climactic judge in Judges. As such, they also point beyond Samson to the one true Judge: "I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, *and in righteousness he judges and makes war*" (Rev. 19:11).

### <span id="page-618-0"></span>JUDGES 13:1–16:31

13 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.

**<sup>2</sup>**There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. And his wife was barren and had no children. **3**And the angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, "Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. **4**Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, **<sup>5</sup>** for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines." **6**Then the woman came and told her husband, "A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name, **7**but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.' "

**<sup>8</sup>**Then Manoah prayed to the Lord and said, "O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born." **9**And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her. **<sup>10</sup>** So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me." **11**And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to this woman?" And he said, "I am." **12**And Manoah said, "Now when your words come true, what is to be the child's manner of life, and what is his mission?" **13**And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful. **<sup>14</sup>** She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe."

**<sup>15</sup>**Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat for you." **16**And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, "If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the Lord." (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord.) **17**And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?" **18**And the angel of the Lord said to him, "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?" **<sup>19</sup>** So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord, to the one who works*<sup>1</sup>* wonders, and Manoah and his wife were watching. **20**And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord

went up in the flame of the altar. Now Manoah and his wife were watching, and they fell on their faces to the ground.

**<sup>21</sup>**The angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord. **22**And Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, for we have seen God." **23**But his wife said to him, "If the Lord had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these." **24**And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the young man grew, and the Lord blessed him. **25**And the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

14Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines. **2**Then he came up and told his father and mother, "I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah. Now get her for me as my wife." **3**But his father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes."

**<sup>4</sup>**His father and mother did not know that it was from the Lord, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.

**<sup>5</sup>**Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring. **6**Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. **7**Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson's eyes.

**<sup>8</sup>**After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. **9**He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.

**<sup>10</sup>** His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do. **11**As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. **12**And Samson said to them, "Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes, **13**but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes." And they said to him, "Put your riddle, that we may hear it." **<sup>14</sup>**And he said to them,

"Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet."

And in three days they could not solve the riddle.

**<sup>15</sup>**On the fourth*<sup>2</sup>* day they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?" **16**And Samson's wife wept over him and said, "You only hate me; you do not love me. You have

put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is." And he said to her, "Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?" **<sup>17</sup>** She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people. **18**And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down,

"What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?"

And he said to them,

"If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle."

**19**And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father's house. **20**And Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.

15 After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he said, "I will go in to my wife in the chamber." But her father would not allow him to go in. **2**And her father said, "I really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead." **3**And Samson said to them, "This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm." **<sup>4</sup>** So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails. **5**And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards. **6**Then the Philistines said, "Who has done this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion." And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. **7**And Samson said to them, "If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit." **8**And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.

**<sup>9</sup>**Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. **10**And the men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us." **11**Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them." **12**And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves." **13**They said to him, "No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.

**<sup>14</sup>**When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands. **15**And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men. **16**And Samson said,

"With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men."

**<sup>17</sup>**As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.*<sup>3</sup>*

**<sup>18</sup>**And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the Lord and said, "You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?" **19**And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore;*<sup>4</sup>* it is at Lehi to this day. **20**And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

16 Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her. **2**The Gazites were told, "Samson has come here." And they surrounded the place and set an ambush for him all night at the gate of the city. They kept quiet all night, saying, "Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him." **3**But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron.

**<sup>4</sup>**After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. **5**And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, "Seduce him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to humble him. And we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver." **<sup>6</sup>** So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you."

**<sup>7</sup>** Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man." **8**Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. **9**Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the bowstrings, as a thread of flax snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.

**<sup>10</sup>**Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you might be bound." **11**And he said to her, "If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man." **<sup>12</sup>** So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And the men lying in ambush were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.

**<sup>13</sup>**Then Delilah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you might be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and fasten it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man." **<sup>14</sup>** So while

he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web.*<sup>5</sup>* And she made them tight with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.

**<sup>15</sup>**And she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me where your great strength lies." **16**And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death. **<sup>17</sup>**And he told her all his heart, and said to her, "A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If my head is shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man."

**<sup>18</sup>**When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up again, for he has told me all his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands. **<sup>19</sup>** She made him sleep on her knees. And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. **20**And she said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free." But he did not know that the Lord had left him. **21**And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles. And he ground at the mill in the prison. **22**But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.

**<sup>23</sup>**Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand." **24**And when the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, "Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us."*<sup>6</sup>* **<sup>25</sup>**And when their hearts were merry, they said, "Call Samson, that he may entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. **26**And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them." **27**Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women, who looked on while Samson entertained.

**<sup>28</sup>**Then Samson called to the Lord and said, "O Lord God, please re member me and please strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes." **29**And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other. **<sup>30</sup>**And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life. **31**Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-623-10"></span><span id="page-623-8"></span><span id="page-623-7"></span><span id="page-623-6"></span>Samson is the twelfth, final, and climactic judge in Judges.37 His account comprises three main sections. It begins with his birth narrative (ch. 13). Next, Samson defeats the Philistines in Timnah (chs. 14–15). This section concludes with the statement that Samson judged Israel for twenty years (15:20). Finally, Samson defeats the Philistines in Gaza (ch. 16). This section also concludes with the statement that Samson judged Israel for twenty years (16:31). The repetition of the concluding formula is one of the ways in which the Samson account is styled by the author as a double judge narrative. Additionally, in sections two and three of the narrative Samson is betrayed by two different women, suffers great personal loss in both instances, and achieves two great victories over the Philistines. Though the accounts are very different, they share the same basic plot—a double narrative plot.

Samson is born as Israel's champion to *begin to* deliver Israel from Philistine oppression; David will complete the work. At birth he is designated a Nazirite for life, as are Samuel and John the Baptist, two other forerunners appearing in the theocratic economy of the Mosaic covenant. Samson is betrayed by those he loves and handed over to the enemy by his own people. His feats of power and his victories over the enemy are enabled by the Spirit of the Lord. In fact, the work of the Spirit is mentioned four times with regard to Samson, more often than with any other judge in the book. Samson is faithful to his calling to defeat the Philistines, faithful even unto death. In his death he achieves his greatest victory over the enemy, a victory that comes in the midst of humiliation, not strength. Additionally, the authors of the Gospels appear to have modeled the life of John the Baptist after that of Samson:

- <span id="page-623-12"></span><span id="page-623-0"></span>(1) Both accounts begin with significant birth narratives (Judges 13; Luke 1:5–25).

- <span id="page-623-4"></span>(6) Both birth narratives record the commission or task of each figure (Judg. 13:5; Luke 1:16–17).
- (7) Both Samson and John the Baptist are betrayed by women (Delilah and the daughter of Herodias, respectively), resulting in their eventual deaths (Judges 16:1–22; Matthew 14:1–12).
- <span id="page-623-11"></span><span id="page-623-9"></span>(8) Both men serve as forerunners to a coming king who achieves rest for his people (2 Sam. 7:1; Matt. 11:28).

<sup>37</sup> He is characterized as the "Eschatological Judge" by Robert A. Stark, "Samson—The Last Judge," *Kerux* 17/3 (December 2002): 24.

It is common for modern interpreters to apply the life of Samson to believers today by teaching that if God can use someone like Samson, a terrible sinner, then he can certainly use people like us to serve his church. Alternatively, they may use the life of Samson to warn against particular behaviors that could result in negative consequences. In reality, however, Samson, like every judge in Judges, is a type of Christ.38 Samson and the other judges are saviors; we are those who need saving. If we desire to identify with anyone in Judges, we ought to identify with the people of Israel, those who continue to do evil in the sight of the Lord despite his saving grace—a people who need a savior. Some readers may be shocked to discover that the actions of Samson are not portrayed as explicitly sinful in these chapters. He is born to slay Philistines. This is his special calling from the Lord—to deliver the Israelites from the Philistines—and he is faithful to his calling. The author of Hebrews would seem to agree (Heb. 11:32–40). One commentator puts it this way:

<span id="page-624-0"></span>Christians readers can hardly fail to notice a number of points of correspondence between the broad structure of Samson's career and that of Christ: his annunciation by a divine messenger, his marvelous conception, his holiness as a Nazirite, his endowment with the Spirit, his rejection by his own people, his being handed over by their leaders, the mocking and scorn he suffered at their hands, and the way his calling was consummated in his death, by which he defeated the god Dagon and laid the foundation for a deliverance to be fully realized in a day to come. The correspondences are too numerous, and too germane to who Samson was, for what he achieved to be simply brushed aside as fanciful. The fact is that when the story is read in the context of the Bible as a whole, we discover even here, in the most unlikely of places, intimations of things to come.39

The way in which we have been taught to think about Samson today is much like the way in which the Pharisees thought of Jesus: someone who associated with the wrong women, ate with the wrong people, and touched what had been forbidden. We should be careful in how we judge these judges. The comments that follow portray Samson as a Spirit-empowered judge who, even now, serves the people of God by helping us to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-625-4"></span><span id="page-625-1"></span>13:1 The account of Samson opens with a standard introductory formula used for the six major judges. The accounts of Othniel (3:7) and Gideon (6:1) begin with the opening introductory formula for each triad of major judges: "And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord." The remaining judges (Ehud, Deborah/Barak, Jephthah, and Samson) begin with a slightly modified, continuative introductory formula: "And the people of Israel *again did* what was evil in the sight of the Lord."40

<span id="page-625-0"></span>During the time of Samson, the Lord gives his people into the hand of the Philistines for forty years—the longest period of oppression in Judges and double the years of oppression in the time of Deborah and Barak (and thus another doubling feature of the narrative).41 In 3:3 the five lords of the Philistines are listed among the nations whom the Lord left in the land to test Israel and to teach her war. The five lords correspond to the five capital cities of the Philistines, a pentapolis comprising Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron (all in the western coastal region of Canaan).42 Samson will defeat Philistines in Ashkelon, Timnah, and Gaza, while Goliath is the famous Philistine from Gath (1 Sam. 17:4). Shamgar, the first of the minor judges, is noted for killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad (Judg. 3:31), and it is further recorded that Israel worshiped the god of the Philistines (10:6), Dagon (16:23; cf. 1 Sam. 5:2–7). The Philistines will also play a major role in the lives of Samuel, Saul, and David.

<span id="page-626-4"></span>13:2 The account of Samson is unique in many ways. For instance, his birth narrative spans twenty-three of the twenty-five verses in this chapter. Birth narratives in the Bible are used to identify major redemptive-historical figures and follow a literary pattern that may include a barren mother, announcement by the angel of the Lord, the child's commission, the parents' struggle to believe the news, the naming of the child, and the child's favor with the Lord. Seven such birth narratives are found in the Bible, those of Isaac, Jacob/Esau, the twelve patriarchs of Israel, Samson, Samuel, John the Baptist, and Jesus.43 Narratives of this type focus on either the preservation of a promised offspring (Isaac, Jacob, the twelve patriarchs) or the raising up of a deliverer or covenant official (Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist). The birth narrative of Jesus is the seventh and climactic birth narrative and the only one that combines both the promised offspring and the raising up of an important covenant official.

<span id="page-626-3"></span>The birth narrative of Samson contains several of the standard elements mentioned above and closely parallels the birth narratives of Samuel and John the Baptist (cf. Section Overview of 13:1–16:31). The account begins with the name, tribe, and location of his father, followed by the statement that his mother was barren. In the OT the motif of the barren women often indicates that the Lord is about to do something wonderful, as is the case here with Manoah and his wife. Notably, the Samson narrative omits any statement of Israel's oppression or their crying out to the Lord for help. Given the forty-year duration of Philistine rule and the complicity of the tribe of Judah later in the account, it appears that Israel is very happy with her Philistine overlords and gods. The people have become comfortable in their sin and blind to their subjugation. It is, therefore, the Lord's great mercy that causes him to set out to deliver his people even before they come to know of their need.

<span id="page-626-5"></span><span id="page-626-2"></span><span id="page-626-1"></span>13:3 The "angel of the Lord" appears once again. He appeared first in Judges 2:1–5 to indict Israel for breaking the covenant. He appeared again in chapter 6 to call and commission Gideon. He appears now to announce the birth of Samson to his barren mother and to explain the nature of Samson's life and calling. The name of this mother does not appear in the account. Although women play a prominent role in the Samson narratives, Delilah is the only one named.

<span id="page-626-6"></span>13:4–5 The angel of the Lord instructs the mother that she is not to drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. The reason for this is because the promised son will be a "Nazirite to God from the womb." The word "Nazirite" means "devoted" or "consecrated" and refers to a special type of vow described in Numbers 6:1–21. With this special vow, a man or a woman may separate himself or herself to the Lord for a specified period of time. Only Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist are recorded as being Nazirites for life. During the time of separation,

<span id="page-626-0"></span><sup>43</sup> For a helpful study of birth narratives as a type scene with a focus on Samson cf. Benjamin J. M. Johnson, "What Type of Son is Samson? Reading Judges 13 as a Biblical Type-Scene," *JETS* 53/2 (June 2010): 269–286, esp. the comparative chart on page 286. It should be noted that this commentary does not come to the same final conclusion regarding Samson as that argued by Johnson.

<span id="page-627-2"></span>the person making the vow may not drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything produced by the grapevine. Additionally, he cannot cut his hair or shave his face, nor touch or go near someone who has died. When the angel of the Lord explains the vow in Judges 13:5, he mentions only the issue of the razor and the cutting of hair. This particular reference anticipates the way in which Delilah will violate Samson's vow in chapter 16.

<span id="page-627-8"></span><span id="page-627-7"></span><span id="page-627-3"></span><span id="page-627-0"></span>13:6–7 Manoah's wife recounts her encounter with the angel of the Lord to her husband. She describes the angel of the Lord as a "man of God," a designation associated normally with a prophet (e.g., Deut. 33:1; Josh. 14:6; 1 Sam. 2:27; 9:6–8, 10). This makes sense given that the identity of the visitor is not revealed until much later (Judg. 13:21) and that a prophet is the type of person who would or could make such an astonishing announcement. She does, however, hint at his identity by noting that his appearance was "like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome [or "terrifying"]." Struck by his appearance, she fails to ask his name or origin. Manoah's wife accurately reports the message of the angel of the Lord and the corresponding instructions.

<span id="page-627-4"></span>The wife is instructed not to drink wine or strong drink, but she is not the Nazirite. The explanation for this instruction stems from the wife's *current* condition: she is already pregnant! Verses 5 and 7 contain the identical statement "Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son." However, the verb "to conceive" is not in the future tense. In fact, it is not even a verb in Hebrew but an adjective serving as a predicate adjective that could be translated "Behold, *you are pregnant* and will bear a son."44 Since Samson is to be a Nazirite from the womb, his mother must keep the vow while pregnant.

When the wife of Manoah recounts the report to her husband, she adds an important piece of information: after recounting that their son will be a "Nazirite to God from the womb," she adds that he will be so "to the day of his death." This brief reference alludes to the significance of his death as recorded in chapter 16. His vow will come to an end when his life itself comes to an end.

<span id="page-627-5"></span>13:8–11 The news of a barren wife now pregnant, along with the special status of their child, provokes Manoah to pray to the Lord that he might send again the "man of God" in order to provide further instructions regarding this shocking news. It is intriguing that the angel of the Lord does in fact return, but first to Manoah's wife. She is given pride of place in this birth narrative, as both the one who receives the message of the Lord and the one who instructs her husband regarding the special nature of the Lord's appearance (v. 23). In verse 3 the author of the account identified the messenger as the "angel of the Lord," that is, of Yahweh. He knows the truth. However, the parents call him a "man" three times in verses 10–11, hinting at the fact that these new parents do not yet understand the identity of the one with whom they are speaking. This prepares us for the upcoming

<span id="page-627-6"></span><span id="page-627-1"></span><sup>44</sup> For further discussion cf. Block, *Judges, Ruth*, 401–402; Chisholm, *Commentary on Judges and Ruth*, 390–391.

<span id="page-628-12"></span>revelation of the messenger's identity and Manoah's immediate response, "We shall surely die" (v. 22).

<span id="page-628-5"></span><span id="page-628-3"></span>13:12–14 Manoah's inquiry of the Lord could be translated woodenly, "What will be the judgment of the young man and his work?" The word translated "manner of life" (or "judgment") is the word used when Israel goes up to Deborah "for [the] judgment" (4:5) regarding the identification of Barak as the one who will lead Israel in battle. The same is true here with Manoah: the father of Samson is asking about the nature of his son's calling. It is intriguing, therefore, that the angel of the Lord does not answer Manoah's question. He simply responds to Manoah by instructing him to do everything he had instructed his wife to do. The verbs at the end of 13:13–14 could refer to either Manoah or his wife. The ESV prefers the third-person feminine singular renderings ("let *her* be careful" and "let *her*  observe"). Because the angel of the Lord is speaking directly with Manoah, it is also possible to translate these verbs with the second-person masculine singular ("*you* must be careful" and "*you* must observe"). The form of the verb is the same in Hebrew, so either translation is possible and would make sense in context.

<span id="page-628-11"></span><span id="page-628-9"></span><span id="page-628-8"></span><span id="page-628-7"></span><span id="page-628-6"></span>13:15–16 Verses 15–21 focus on the revelation of the identity of the "man of God" who has come to announce the birth of a son to Manoah and his wife. This portion of the narrative is bracketed by statements regarding Manoah's knowledge of the identity of the visitor. At the end of verse 16 it is recorded, "Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord." Then at the end of verse 21 we read, "Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord." This revelation comes in the midst of Manoah's gesture of hospitality in preparing a meal for the visitor. The angel of the Lord refuses the meal and counters with a suggestion to prepare a burnt offering for the Lord. It is when Manoah makes this offering that he will come to discover the identity of the person with whom he and his wife have been speaking. The verb rendered "detain" in verses 15–16 suits the context of the wife's barrenness. This same verb is used at Genesis 16:2 to describe Sarai's barrenness ("the Lord *has prevented* me from bearing children") and then again at Genesis 20:18 to describe the barrenness of the wives of Abimelech ("the Lord *had closed*  all the wombs of the house of Abimelech"). In Proverbs 30:16 the nominal form of this root is used with reference to a "barren womb." The use of this verb here in Judges 13 indicates that the angel of the Lord will not be "detained" with a meal because the once barren wife is no longer restrained in her womb.

<span id="page-628-14"></span><span id="page-628-13"></span><span id="page-628-10"></span><span id="page-628-4"></span><span id="page-628-2"></span><span id="page-628-1"></span><span id="page-628-0"></span>13:17–18 While preparing the burnt offering, Manoah's asks the visitor's name. The visitor responds to his question with another question: "Why do you ask my name?" The Lord does not give his name but responds with the declaration "It is wonderful." This Hebrew word occurs only one other time in the OT, at Psalm 139:6: "Such knowledge is too *wonderful* for me." A similar word (sharing the same root) is used at Exodus 15:11 to describe the victory of the Lord at the Red Sea: "Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, <span id="page-629-8"></span>awesome in glorious deeds, doing *wonders*?" (cf. Ps. 77:11, 14; Isa. 9:6; 25:1; 29:14). The angel of the Lord reveals his wonderful name to Manoah not with words but with ascent in the sacrifice.

<span id="page-629-4"></span><span id="page-629-3"></span>13:19–21 Manoah offers his burnt offering "on the rock" to the "one who works wonders," the author's own explanation of the description of the name of the Lord given in Judges 13:18. The Lord's name is wonderful because he alone is the one who works wonders. Many parallels are present between this offering and Gideon's in chapter 6. Both men prepare a young goat. Both offer the meal as a sacrifice on a rock. In both instances the angel of the Lord ascends in the flame of the offering. When the Lord ascends in the flame, both Gideon and Manoah perceive the identity of the angel of the Lord as God, Yahweh himself. Both men respond with the fear of death. Lastly, both men are assured that they will not die, for the Lord has graciously appeared to reveal his plan of deliverance for his people. With the incarnation, the temporary appearance of the angel of the Lord as a man becomes a permanent reality in Jesus of Nazareth. He is now forever Immanuel, "God is with us" (Isa. 7:14 ESV mg.; Matt. 1:23). Though ascended and waiting to return, he is present with us through his Spirit sent to indwell each believer until the end: "Behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:20).

<span id="page-629-13"></span><span id="page-629-12"></span><span id="page-629-11"></span><span id="page-629-10"></span><span id="page-629-5"></span><span id="page-629-2"></span><span id="page-629-1"></span>13:22–23 As did Gideon, Manoah responds with the fear of death for having come into the presence of the Lord. He has had an Isaiah 6 experience—"Woe is me! For I am lost . . . for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!" (Isa. 6:5). For Gideon in Judges 6 it is the Lord himself who speaks the words of assurance: "Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die" (Judg. 6:23). For Manoah, however, it is his wife who restrains his fear with a quick lesson in theology. The author of the account holds her in high regard. In both visitations the angel of the Lord comes to the wife. When Manoah asks for further instructions regarding the promised son, the angel responds by deferring to the instructions already delivered to his wife. By all accounts Manoah's wife is a Proverbs 31:10 woman, an "excellent wife" (or "woman of strength"). In Judges she appears among heroic women such as Deborah and Jael who faithfully fulfill their roles in God's plan to deliver his people.

<span id="page-629-9"></span><span id="page-629-7"></span><span id="page-629-6"></span><span id="page-629-0"></span>13:24 The birth narrative of Samson logically concludes with the account of his birth. Besides his birth, three additional facts are recorded. First, the mother names her son "Samson," another factor in her prominence in this narrative. Though never explicitly defined, Samson's name may be significant. It appears to be a combination of the Hebrew word for "sun" and a diminutive ending—thus "little sun" (cf. comment on 3:13–14, concerning Eglon's name). His name may correspond antithetically to Delilah's (ch. 16). Her name looks like the Hebrew for "night" and could constitute a play on words: Samson is a "little sun," but Delilah is "of the night." Second, it is stated that the boy "grew" (or "became great"; AT). Lastly, it is stated that the Lord blessed Samson, though the specific nature of this blessing is not stated. The stature and blessing of Samson correspond to similar descriptions

<span id="page-630-11"></span>of Samuel, the last of the judges (1 Sam. 2:21; 3:19). Both men have similar births and prepare the way for the arrival of David as the king of Israel.

<span id="page-630-4"></span>In Judges 13:24a Samson is a child, while in 13:24b he has become a young man. He is ready to begin his service as a judge and is called to do so by the Lord in the next verse.

<span id="page-630-8"></span><span id="page-630-5"></span>13:25 This verse is not the conclusion to Samson's birth account but the introduction to the second episode in his narrative. Four important statements serve as the backbone for this episode. First, it is recorded that the Lord incites Samson to go down to Timnah (v. 25). Second, the Lord orchestrates his marriage to the Philistine woman from Timnah (14:4). Third and fourth, the Spirit of the Lord enables Samson to defeat the Philistines (14:6, 19). The Lord had raised up Samson in order to *begin* to deliver Israel from the Philistines (13:5). This is the beginning of the beginning.

<span id="page-630-12"></span><span id="page-630-9"></span><span id="page-630-3"></span><span id="page-630-0"></span>This section begins with a statement of divine initiative: "The Spirit of the Lord began to stir" Samson. The Hebrew verb rendered "to stir" occurs only five times in the OT (and only here in this form of the verb). In three instances someone's spirit is "troubled" or "stirred up" because of a dream (Gen. 41:8; Dan. 2:1, 3). In Psalm 77:3–4 the psalmist laments, "My spirit faints. . . . I am so *troubled* that I cannot speak." In each of these four instances a human's spirit is troubled or stirred up by either a dream or some form of suffering. In this case, however, it is the very Spirit of the Lord who prompts Samson to go down to Timnah.45

<span id="page-630-7"></span><span id="page-630-6"></span>14:1–3 Timnah is a town between Dan to the north and Philistia to the south. At the Lord's initiative Samson makes a quick round trip to this border town, where he encounters a Philistine woman who catches his eye. Upon return from Timnah he reports this news to his parents and asks them to "get" (or "take") her as his wife. His parents respond with a question regarding suitable options from among his own people. They are likely shocked that Samson would seek to marry a Philistine woman, a daughter of the enemy that has been ruling over Israel forty years. His response in Judges 14:3 echoes his request in 14:2, but this time he provides the reason for his request: "She is right in my eyes." This statement has been interpreted in multiple ways. Some have taken it as a negative statement because of its similarity to the refrain in 17:6; 21:25: "In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes." Taken in this way, Samson would be asking for a marriage in violation of his parents' and the Lord's will, something in the category of "unequally yoked" (2 Cor. 6:14). It is also true that God's people are to do what is right in *his* eyes (Deut. 12:28), not what is right in *their own* eyes (Deut. 12:8; cf. Prov. 12:15; 21:2). However, the very next verse indicates that these events are orchestrated by the Lord himself, and so we should be cautious of an overly negative interpretation of Samson's actions. Marriage to a Canaanite was forbidden, but marriage to a Philistine was not prohibited in OT

<span id="page-630-13"></span><span id="page-630-10"></span><span id="page-630-2"></span><span id="page-630-1"></span><sup>45</sup> For the geography of the Samson narrative cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 114, map 4.22.

<span id="page-631-7"></span>law.46 Additionally, statements of this type can also be used in a positive manner to express that something is good or acceptable (e.g., "Saul's daughter Michal loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him [or, "the matter was right in his eyes"]"; 1 Sam. 18:20; cf. 18:26; 29:6). Given the spiritual condition of Israel in Judges, Samson's selection of a Philistine bride may serve as an implicit condemnation of Israel as a nation and, at the same time, provide Samson with the opportunity to fulfill his calling as Israel's judge.

<span id="page-631-4"></span><span id="page-631-2"></span>14:4 This verse is key for understanding the events recorded in Judges 14–15. Although Samson's parents are well meaning in their desire for him to marry a woman from among their own people, this arrangement is the Lord's doing. The clause "*it* was from the Lord" could also be rendered "*she* was from the Lord." The final statement that the "Philistines ruled over Israel" echoes the statement of Gideon in 8:23: "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; *the Lord will rule over you*." This is yet another way in which the author portrays Israel's poor spiritual condition at this time.

<span id="page-631-5"></span><span id="page-631-1"></span><span id="page-631-0"></span>14:5–6 Samson makes a second trip to Timnah, this time with his father and mother. It appears Samson has convinced his parents to consider the possibility of his marrying this Philistine woman. After arriving at the vineyards of Timnah, Samson encounters a roaring lion. At this moment the Spirit of the Lord rushes upon Samson, and he is able to tear the lion apart before it does so to him. The Spirit of the Lord has come upon Othniel (3:10), Gideon (6:34), Jephthah (11:29), and now Samson. Samson's great strength does not derive from an exceptional physique or large muscles, as he is often portrayed. Rather, Samson's strength comes to him through the enabling presence of the Spirit of the Lord. If Samson's physique were the source of his strength, it would have been obvious to Delilah, and her discovery of his secret would not have required the ordeal recorded in chapter 16. This is another instance of the Lord's desire to work his strength through human weakness (1 Cor. 1:27; 2 Cor. 12:10). The author of Hebrews puts it this way when writing about Samson and his colleagues: they were those who were "made strong out of weakness" (Heb. 11:34). This should also remind us that "the weakness of God is stronger than men" (1 Cor. 1:25). The feats of Samson should point us to the strength of God, not to the weak vessel through whom it was manifest. Finally, this struggle with a lion provides the background for understanding Samson's riddle that will occupy the majority of this chapter. The fact that he does not inform his parents of the feat will also play a role in the outcome of the events that follow, perhaps even saving their lives from the threat of the Philistines.

In Judges 14:1 Samson simply "saw" the woman, but this time he speaks with her. And his initial assessment is

<sup>46</sup> Cf. Ryan, *Judges*, 103. For the origin of the Philistines (Sea Peoples) cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 113.

<span id="page-632-3"></span>confirmed: she is "right in Samson's eyes"—a statement similar to that delivered to his parents (v. 3). With suitability confirmed, marriage preparations begin.

<span id="page-632-5"></span>14:8–9 It appears that Samson returns home after speaking to the Philistine woman regarding marriage. The amount of elapsed time between his second and third trips is unstated; the text simply states that the latter occurs "after some days." The only hint is the reference to the lion carcass, the presence of a swarm of bees, and the production of honey. It would have taken months for the lion carcass to dry out, the bees to establish and grow a hive, and the production of honey to begin. This passing of time indicates that Samson has waited patiently for the marriage to occur. The presence of the honey in the carcass and the fact that he removes some of it to eat will also play a part in the upcoming riddle. Once again, it is stated that he does not tell his parents. No one except Sampson will have firsthand knowledge of the events behind the riddle.

<span id="page-632-2"></span><span id="page-632-1"></span>Some have argued that Samson violates his Nazirite vow by taking honey from the lion carcass, based upon the restriction that "all the days that he separates himself to the Lord he shall not go near a dead body" (Num. 6:6). The proposed violation is unlikely, for a number of reasons: First, the restriction against going near a dead body pertains to human corpses, not animal carcasses, as the explanation of the restriction implies: "Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean" (Num. 6:7; cf. v. 9).47 Second, if the restriction against going near a dead body included animal life, then Samson would have been prevented from eating meat, Samuel from making sacrifices as a priest, and John the Baptist from eating locusts. All three men were Nazirites for life, and this did not require vegetarianism. Third, when Samson's vow is violated by Delilah, the text explicitly identifies that violation. There is no such identification here. Finally, we recall that Samson's killing of the lion has been enabled by the Spirit of the Lord, and these events are "from the Lord" (Judg. 14:4) in order that Samson might begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines.48 These events provide the occasion for his first great defeat of the Philistines, and the cost to himself will also be great.

<span id="page-632-6"></span><span id="page-632-4"></span>14:10–11 The wedding plans continue. Samson's father goes down to the woman, either to make further plans or to take her to Samson as a wife. In celebration Samson hosts a feast, as is the tradition of the young men at the time, and the people of Timnah provide Samson with thirty companions to attend him in this wedding celebration. For some interpreters Samson's presence at this feast constitutes a violation of his Nazirite vow, with its restriction against drinking wine or strong drink (Num. 6:3). It is argued that because the Hebrew word for "feast" shares the same root as the verb "to drink," Samson must have shared in the wine and strong drink offered at the celebration. Such an interpretation, however, again is unlikely. The mere fact that Samson hosts a feast does not require him to drink

<span id="page-632-0"></span><sup>47</sup> Chisholm, *Commentary on Judges and Ruth*, 406.

<sup>48</sup> Cf. Jordan, *Judges*, 247–248.

wine and violate his vow.49 Having grown up in a time of extended wedding feasts, Samson would have attended any number of feasts in his lifetime, and his vow would have prohibited the partaking of wine at all such feasts. Samson would have been a well-trained teetotaler by this time.

<span id="page-633-0"></span>14:12–13 During the wedding feast Samson enters into a contest with his Philistine companions. This contest consists of solving a riddle; the winner will receive "thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes." Samson gives his companions a week to solve the riddle. The text does not identify the reason for the contest, and it is best not to guess. We do know, however, that the events surrounding the solution to the riddle and Samson's loss in the contest provide the occasion for the defeat of Philistines in Ashkelon and later many from Timnah.

<span id="page-633-1"></span>14:14 The riddle consists of two lines, with three Hebrew words in each line:

out-of-the-eater came-out something-to-eat out-of-the-strong came-out something-sweet

In Hebrew, pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions can be attached to the front (prefixes) or back (suffixes) of other words, usually nouns or verbs. This allows for tremendous flexibility when rendering poetic lines. In each of the Hebrew lines for this riddle, the first and third words begin with the Hebrew letter corresponding to our *m* (Hb. *mem*), and the second word in each line begins with the Hebrew letter corresponding to our *y* (*yod*). This results in an *m*-*y*-*m* pattern when pronouncing each line in the original language. The riddle is both short and "sweet." In terms of meaning, the riddle derives from Samson's experience with the lion carcass on his second trip to Timnah. The eater in the first line is something strong in the second line: a lion. Then, something to eat in the first line is something sweet in the second line: the honey. The key for solving the riddle is to determine what comes out of a strong eater that is also sweet to eat. Unless someone has firsthand knowledge of Samson's encounter with the lion, the riddle is almost impossible to answer. This explains why Samson did not tell his parents about his encounters with the lion.

<span id="page-633-2"></span>14:15 At the end of Judges 14:14 it was noted that Samson's Philistine companions sought to solve the riddle for three days without success. Rather than give in to loss, however, the Philistines now employ a secondary tactic: they threaten Samson's wife with death for both her and her father's household if she does not get the answer from Samson and give it to them before the time is up on the "fourth" or "seventh" (ESV mg.) day. The reading "fourth day" is from the LXX, and a four-day sequence makes good sense in light of the connection between verses 14 and 15: the Philistines try to solve the riddle for three days and then on the fourth day opt to threaten Samson's wife.50 The reading "seventh day" is supported by verse 17, which records that Samson's wife wept all seven days of the feast and then pressed him hard

<span id="page-633-3"></span><sup>49</sup> Chisholm, *Commentary on Judges and Ruth*, 408n103.

<sup>50</sup> The difference in spelling between the Hebrew for "fourth" and for "seventh" is a single letter.

<span id="page-634-1"></span>about the riddle. Thus some have suggested that "three days" in verse 14 should be amended to "six days."51 It is difficult to know with certainty which option to prefer. In such instances it is best the let the Hebrew text stand, since the differences do not impact the overall meaning of the text. Samson's wife is distressed about the riddle for the duration of the feast; the Philistines cannot solve the riddle and thus threaten the wife with death to obtain the answer. The events here correspond to Delilah's enticement of Samson in chapter 16. The Philistines persuade a woman to entice Samson in order to discover a secret known only to him. The discovery of the secret results in a loss for Samson, but that loss is turned into defeat of the Philistines. The same verb ("to entice, persuade") is used in both instances (14:15; 16:5).

<span id="page-634-8"></span><span id="page-634-3"></span><span id="page-634-2"></span>14:16–17 Out of fear for her life and that of her father's household, Samson's wife cajoles the answer to the riddle from him by questioning his love for her: "You only hate me; you do not love me." Samson relents due to the fact that "she pressed him hard." These are the same tactics later employed by Delilah. She also questions Samson's love, "How can you say, 'I love you'?" (16:15), and "pressed him hard" (16:16) to obtain the secret of his great strength. The parallels are intentional, not accidental. The literary design of the accounts is intricate and beautiful.

<span id="page-634-11"></span><span id="page-634-10"></span><span id="page-634-9"></span><span id="page-634-4"></span>14:18 The men of Timnah provide Samson with the solution to the riddle on the seventh day before the setting of the sun. The term used for "sun" is not the common word in the OT; it occurs only here and at Job 9:7 ("who commands the sun, and it does not rise"). Samson's response to their answer is proverbial in nature. Like the riddle itself, it contains two lines, with three words in each line. Both lines begin with the Hebrew letter corresponding to our *l* (Hb. *lamed*) and end with the Hebrew letter corresponding to our *y* (*yod*). In terms of meaning, his response indicates that their success in the riddle contest has been achieved in an illicit manner. One does not "plow" with another man's heifer!

<span id="page-634-5"></span>14:19–20 Following Samson's loss, the Spirit of the Lord rushes upon him a second time and enables him to overcome thirty Philistines from the coastal city of Ashkelon, one of the five Philistines capitals. With the spoils of victory, Samson returns and pays the wager to his companions. The Philistines won in Timnah, but they suffer great loss in Ashkelon. This is only the beginning of Samson's work to overcome the Philistine threat in Israel. This section of the narrative concludes with Samson's returning to his father's house in anger over the betrayal of his wife. It is followed by the notice that the wife is given to one of his so-called companions. This event sets the stage for Samson's upcoming fourth and final visit to Timnah, recorded in chapter 15.

<span id="page-634-7"></span><span id="page-634-6"></span>15:1 "After some days" Samson makes a fourth trip to Timnah. This same temporal expression marked the beginning of his third trip: "*After some days* he returned to take [marry] her" (Judg. 14:8). This time, however, the two are already married, and

<span id="page-634-0"></span><sup>51</sup> Again a difference of only one letter in Hebrew.

<span id="page-635-2"></span>Samson returns to be with his wife. The reference to the wheat harvest sets the scene for Samson's upcoming destruction of the Philistine harvest. The fact that he takes a young goat and expresses his desire to enter his wife's room indicates that Samson's anger over the events recorded in the previous chapter (14:19) has abated. The reason for the refusal of his request is known to the reader, but not Samson (14:20).

<span id="page-635-4"></span><span id="page-635-3"></span>15:2 The initial verbal constructions in Hebrew indicates that the woman's father is sincere in both his actions and his response to Samson: "I *really* thought that you *utterly* hated her." Given the events recorded in the previous chapter, concluding with Samson's departure in anger, the father likely expected never to see Samson again. His offer of his younger daughter implies his willingness to right the wrong done to Samson, but Samson does not accept the offer, and this becomes the occasion for his destruction of the Philistine harvest. The younger daughter is described in the Hebrew simply as "better than her," that is, better than her older sister. It is unknown in what way she is "better," but many interpreters understand it to be in regard to physical beauty. This language is similar to the description of the daughters of man in Genesis 6:2: "The sons of God saw that the daughters of man were *attractive* [or "good"]. And they took as their wives any they chose." Again, the category of "good" is not specified in the Hebrew, and it may or may not include physical appearance. The theme of the younger daughter is also reminiscent of the Leah and Rachel account (Genesis 29).

<span id="page-635-5"></span><span id="page-635-1"></span><span id="page-635-0"></span>15:3 Samson refuses the offer of his former father-in-law and uses the opportunity to deliver a great blow to the Philistines. In the previous episode the Philistines may have considered Samson's actions in Ashkelon to be unwarranted. This time, however, they will understand the reason for this "harm."

<span id="page-635-8"></span><span id="page-635-6"></span>15:4–5 Perhaps it was this event that inspired the words of Song of Solomon 2:15:

 Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom.

Of all the major judges, only Samson delivers without the assistance of other warriors from Israel. He fights alone—or, in this case, with the help of an army of foxes. The capture of three hundred foxes is yet another feat of strength recorded in the Samson account, an ingenious tactic employed against the enemy of God's people. The success of the tactic is implied by the description of the destruction, which includes both harvested (stacked) and unharvested (standing) grain as well as olive orchards—a complete agricultural disaster for the Philistines.

<span id="page-635-7"></span>15:6–8 The Philistine response is directed toward Samson's former wife and fatherin-law. The Philistines recognize the destruction of the grain and orchards to be the result of previous wrongdoing on the part of Samson's father-in-law in giving J udges 13:1–16:31 636

<span id="page-636-4"></span>the wife to another man. The Philistines' actions accord with the previous threat of Samson's wedding companions (Judg. 14:15). They burn her and her father just as Samson had set fire to the fields and orchards of Timnah. Samson uses this tragedy as yet another opportunity to deliver a great blow to the Philistines: "If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit." The verb translated "quit" shares spelling features with the Hebrew for "riddle" and constitutes a play on words reflecting how all of this began. The text does not provide any of the details related to the battle, only a summary statement that Samson "struck them hip and thigh with a great blow." This language appears only here in the Bible; its exact meaning is unknown. It could mean a complete victory or perhaps describe a tactic employed to overcome the enemy (cf. Gen. 32:25). If used euphemistically, it means that Samson hit them where it really counts. Upon victory, Samson flees into the region of Judah and hides from the Philistines in a place known as the "cleft of the rock of Etam."

<span id="page-636-12"></span><span id="page-636-6"></span><span id="page-636-1"></span><span id="page-636-0"></span>15:9–10 The Philistines "came up" (the language of entering into battle; "go up," Judg. 1:1) and encamp in Judah at Lehi. The Philistines have come to wage war on Samson, to do to him what he has done to them. The name of the location, "Lehi," is the Hebrew for "jawbone" and points forward to the way in which Samson will slay a thousand Philistine warriors. The use of the name here is anachronistic (out of chronological order), since the name is given after the battle that follows (15:17). The binding of Samson is a theme that will return in chapter 16. The verb "to bind" occurs five times in 15:10–13 and then twelve times more in 16:5–25. In the end, it is the binding and subjugation of Samson that will provide the occasion for his greatest victory over the Philistines.

<span id="page-636-13"></span><span id="page-636-10"></span><span id="page-636-8"></span><span id="page-636-7"></span><span id="page-636-2"></span>15:11–13 Rather than joining forces with Samson and engaging the Philistines together, the men of Judah bind Samson and hand him over to their common enemy. This betrayal portrays the growing corruption of Israel. Gideon had proclaimed the simple truth that the Lord is the one who "rules over" his people (8:23). Here this statement of the men of Judah constitutes both the literal and the spiritual truth for Israel at this time: it is no longer the Lord who rules over his people, for they have rejected him as King. The Philistines now are "rulers over" God's people, who now yield to the will of their overlords. In Judges 15:10 the Philistines said they had come to "do to him as he did to us." Now here in verse 11 Samson states, "As they did to me, so I have done to them." It is important to remember that it was the Spirit of the Lord who first stirred Samson to go down to Timnah (13:25), where he first saw the woman who would become his wife, which occasioned all of the events to follow. It began with a riddle, a wager, and the Philistines' plowing with Samson's "heifer" (14:18). That brief spark ignited what has now become a raging fire of death and destruction.

<span id="page-636-11"></span><span id="page-636-9"></span><span id="page-636-5"></span><span id="page-636-3"></span>15:14–17 For the third time in this section of the Samson narrative the Spirit of the Lord rushes upon him and empowers him to break free of his ropes and deliver yet <span id="page-637-2"></span>another great blow to the Philistines. The enabling presence of the Spirit reminds us that it is not Samson's own physical strength that allows him to achieve such a great victory. It is the power of the Spirit's coming upon him that explains this miraculous event. Again fighting alone, Samson slays a thousand Philistines with the jawbone (Hb. *lekhi* ) of a donkey. This account recalls the victory of Shamgar, who defeated six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad (3:31). Both men defeat superior forces with unconventional weapons. In response to his victory over the Philistines, Samson composes a brief song to memorialize the occasion, in the tradition of Moses after the Red Sea victory (Ex. 15:1) and Deborah and Barak after the defeat of the Canaanites (Judg. 5:1). The poem consists of two lines, with four words in the first line and five in the second:

<span id="page-637-3"></span><span id="page-637-0"></span>with-the-jawbone-of the-donkey a-heap two-heaps with-the-jawbone-of the-donkey I-have-struck a-thousand men

With the jawbone of the donkey Samson makes heaps of men by slaying them in battle. In Hebrew the words for "donkey" and "heap" are homonyms. In this way Samson mocks his enemy, having made them "asses" in battle. To further commemorate the battle Samson names the site "Ramath-lehi," or "Jawbone Hill."

<span id="page-637-5"></span>15:18–19 In the final scene of this section Samson succumbs to the fatigue of battle and is overcome with great thirst. It is difficult to imagine how much time and effort it would have taken to defeat a thousand warriors armed with only a jawbone and fueled by the Spirit of the Lord. Samson the man had become the Lord's weapon, and it took a real, physical toll on his body. Samson "called upon the Lord" for help. In his prayer Samson acknowledges the Lord's agency in the defeat of the Philistines and reckons that if God can achieve "this great salvation," then he can certainly provide water for his weary warrior. He is correct in his assessment, and the Lord miraculously provides water by splitting open a hollow place whereby Samson is able to drink so that his spirit is revived. As with the location of the battle, Samson commemorates this miraculous event by naming the spring "En-hakkore," that is, "the spring of him who called [upon the Lord]" (ESV mg.). The miraculous provision of water from a rock recalls the events of Massah and Meribah in Exodus 17, in which the Lord provided water for Israel from the rock that Moses struck. Similarly, after Elijah defeated the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18), he fled into the wilderness (1 Kings 19). With Elijah weary from the journey, the Lord miraculously provided water in order to strengthen him for the remaining trip. The reference here to the Philistines as "uncircumcised" recalls the assessment of Samson's parents at the beginning of this episode (Judg. 14:3) and so brings this portion of the Samson narrative to a conclusion.

<span id="page-637-8"></span><span id="page-637-7"></span><span id="page-637-6"></span><span id="page-637-4"></span><span id="page-637-1"></span>15:20 The account of Samson in Judges comprises three main parts: his birth narrative, his work in Timnah, and his work in Gaza. This verse brings the second main part to a conclusion, the record of the events focused in and around Timnah. A similar statement appears at the end of the third and final section of <span id="page-638-8"></span>the narrative: "He had judged Israel twenty years" (16:31). This is a literary device allowing the author to create a double narrative account for the final and climactic judge in the book.

<span id="page-638-7"></span><span id="page-638-6"></span>16:1 This last section of the Samson narrative contains the account of Samson's defeat of Gaza (one of the five Philistine capital cities) by way of his association with two women of questionable character, a prostitute (vv. 1–3) and Delilah (vv. 4–31). In these first three verses Samson enters Gaza, stays with a prostitute, and then removes the gates of the city. This new section begins just as the previous one did. In 14:1 it was recorded that Samson "went down to Timnah, and . . . he saw" a woman. Now here it is recorded that "Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw" a woman. This time, however, the woman is described not as one of the daughters of the Philistines but as a prostitute.

<span id="page-638-10"></span><span id="page-638-5"></span><span id="page-638-4"></span><span id="page-638-0"></span>The clause "and he went in to her" could imply that Samson went to the prostitute in Gaza in order to engage in illicit sexual activity. Interpretations of this type are certainly possible, and this expression does constitute one of the ways in which the Hebrew language can speak of sexual activity (Cf. Gen. 38:18; Ezek. 23:44; 2 Sam. 12:24). This expression, however, does not always carry the nuance of sexual innuendo.52 Perhaps the best example of this appears earlier in the book, at Judges 4:22, in which Barak enters the tent of the woman Jael in pursuit of Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army. The same expression appearing here in 16:1 also appears in 4:22 with regard to Barak, there rendered "So he went in to her tent." There is no Hebrew for "tent" here; it is added based on an interpretation of the event. So then, what is Samson's reason for staying with a prostitute in Gaza if not to engage the services expected of such a person?

<span id="page-638-9"></span>When traveling in the ancient world, a traveler may have stopped at night in a town or village on the way to his final destination. Upon entering the town, he would sit in the town square waiting for an elder or other upstanding citizen to invite the visitor to his home for the evening (e.g., 19:11–21). In this way the traveler's presence and purpose for visiting would have become immediately clear. If, however, one desired to enter a town without being known, it would have been a good strategy to stay with a prostitute (perhaps also innkeeper) in order to conceal one's true intent. When Joshua sends two spies to look over Jericho, for example, the spies stay with Rahab, a prostitute.

<span id="page-638-3"></span><span id="page-638-2"></span><span id="page-638-1"></span>There are, in fact, a number of elements connecting the activities of the spies in Jericho with Samson's in Gaza. First, the designation for a female prostitute is the same in each account (Josh. 2:1; Judg. 16:1). Second, in both accounts the men "enter" or "go in" and stay with the prostitute (same verb). But no one suspects the spies in Joshua 2 of illicit sexual activity. Third, the inhabitants of Jericho and Gaza discover the presence and intent of the foreign visitors and plan for their demise (Josh. 2:2; Judg. 16:2). Fourth, the spies and Samson escape from the town in dramatic and memorable ways. The spies are hidden by Rahab and escape through

<span id="page-639-4"></span><span id="page-639-1"></span>her window during the night (Josh. 2:15). Samson also escapes during the night, while taking with him the city gates (Judg. 16:3).53

<span id="page-639-0"></span>The comparison of Joshua 2 with Judges 16 suggests that Samson's night with a prostitute in Gaza is the author's way of preparing us for the eventual destruction of the town later in the chapter. We know that the two Israelite men stay with a prostitute in Jericho in order to spy out the town before destroying it. Given the larger context of Judges 16, Samson appears to be doing the very same thing in Gaza. Samson is not in Gaza to have a good time. Rather, he is spying on the town in preparation for its destruction. This is also why the author of Judges is careful to record that when Samson leaves Gaza he takes the city gates with him (cf. comment on 16:3). When approaching this part of the narrative, we are warned by the example of Samson's parents, who "did not know that it was from the Lord, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines" (14:4).

<span id="page-639-3"></span><span id="page-639-2"></span>16:2 Samson's presence is somehow discovered in Gaza. He has singlehandedly killed thousands of Philistine warriors and destroyed a large portion of their annual crops. He is definitely on the Philistine's Most Wanted list. So the people of Gaza set an ambush for him in order to kill him when he attempts to leave the city in the morning. The theme of ambush will continue later in this chapter with Delilah (cf. vv. 9, 12).

<span id="page-639-5"></span>16:3 The events recorded in this verse are truly remarkable. The silence of the people of Gaza in verse 2 does not compare with the silence of the author in verse 3. How does Samson tear out the city gates while the people of Gaza are lying in ambush for him there? Is there a battle? Why does Samson remove the city gates? And why does he take them to the region of Hebron? With so much detail lacking, the author forces us to focus on what remains. First, city gates are typically large and heavy, serving as a key component for defense and security. The gates, posts, and bolt would weigh thousands of pounds; their removal by a single individual without tools is a miraculous feat of strength. Additionally, the distance from Gaza to Hebron is approximately 40 miles (64 km). A forty-mile hike is impressive. A forty-mile hike while carrying approximately a ton of lumber is miraculous. Clearly, the author of this account desires the reader to understand that this is yet another feat of strength enabled by the Spirit of the Lord. It is also worth noting that Hebron is the city from which David rules Judah for the first seven and a half years of his reign—thus this is another instance of the forerunner pointing ahead to the one who will finish the work of defeating the Philistines (2 Sam. 5:5).

<span id="page-639-8"></span><span id="page-639-6"></span>Why does Samson take the city gates? In the ancient world a city's gates were crucial to its defenses, and thus their destruction symbolized the destruction of the city. Lamentations 2:9 states in regard to the fall of Jerusalem, for instance, "Her *gates* have sunk into the ground; he has ruined and broken her bars" (cf. Jer. 51:30; Amos 1:5). But this is not the whole story. The true significance of the gates in this

<span id="page-639-9"></span><span id="page-639-7"></span><sup>53</sup> For additional exegetical evidence supporting this view of the events in Gaza cf. Gordon P. Hugenberger's upcoming commentary on the book of Judges, ApOTC (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, forthcoming).

<span id="page-640-0"></span>text is that God, through Samson, continues to be faithful to the promises he made to the patriarchs. To Abraham God promised, "I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. *And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies*" (Gen. 22:17; cf. 24:60). In this text, therefore, Samson is a picture of God's faithfulness to his covenant people to do for them what they have repeatedly failed to do for themselves: to possess the land and all of God's good promises. At the end of this chapter Samson will destroy the temple in Gaza, bringing the destruction of this city to completion and so fulfilling his calling as judge to *begin* to save Israel from the Philistines.

<span id="page-640-7"></span><span id="page-640-4"></span>16:4 The expression "After this" identifies a new scene in this final section of the Samson narrative. It appears that Samson has fallen in love for a second time, this time with a woman named Delilah, from the Valley of Sorek.54 The exact nature of their relationship (unmarried, engaged, married) is not stated. The text simply states that Samson loves Delilah. Later, she will use this love to her advantage in order to betray Samson to the Philistines (Judg. 16:15). Women play a prominent role in the Samson narrative, but Delilah is the only woman whose name is given. The meaning of her name is perhaps related to loose or dangling hair, which may suggest flirtatiousness.55 However, her name may also constitute a play on words with Samson's. His name means "little sun," while the spelling of Delilah's name contains the letters for the Hebrew for "night," thus suggesting something like "of the night." This is a fitting play on words, as Delilah will serve as the instrument for bringing the darkness of blindness to Samson (v. 21).56

<span id="page-640-8"></span><span id="page-640-5"></span><span id="page-640-2"></span>16:5 The lords of the Philistines learn of Samson's love for Delilah, and they offer an incredible sum of money if she will discover the riddle of Samson's strength and betray him. The Hebrew verb rendered "seduce" is the verb rendered "entice" at 14:15, in which Samson's wife in Timnah was asked to discover the answer to Samson's riddle. Both accounts share a number of elements in common: Samson falls in love with a woman, the woman entices (seduces) Samson to reveal a secret, the woman betrays Samson by telling the secret to the Philistines, the Philistines use the secret for Samson's harm, and Samson ultimately overcomes the enemy.

<span id="page-640-1"></span>If the secret of Samson's strength is discovered, the Philistines plan to "humble" him. This verb often carries stronger overtones, such as "humiliate," "oppress," or "do violence," including acts as severe as rape (cf. Gen. 34:2; 2 Samuel 13:1–22; Judg. 19:24–25; Lam. 5:11).57

<span id="page-640-9"></span><span id="page-640-6"></span>16:6–14 The account next records Delilah's first three attempts to discover the secret of Samson's great strength. The fact that it is a secret provides important evidence that the strength does not derive from large muscles or a huge physique.

<sup>54</sup> The Valley of Sorek is located in the territory of the tribe of Judah, north of Hebron and south of Jerusalem. Cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 114, map 4.22.

<sup>55</sup> *HALOT*, 1:222.

<span id="page-640-3"></span><sup>56</sup> The Hebrew word for "night" appears four times in the previous account (vv. 1–3) and may serve to connect these final two episodes in the Samson narrative (Crenshaw, *Samson*, 18–19). 57 *HALOT*, 2:852–853.

All three attempts to discover the secret of Samson's strength follow the same basic structure, comprising five parts:

- <span id="page-641-5"></span>(1) Delilah requests that Samson reveal the secret of his strength (Judg. 16:6, 10, 13).
- <span id="page-641-6"></span>(2) Samson provides an incorrect answer (vv. 7, 11, 13).
- <span id="page-641-7"></span>(3) Delilah carries out the incorrect procedure (vv. 8, 12, 14).
- <span id="page-641-8"></span>(4) Delilah alerts Samson to the Philistine ambush (vv. 9, 12, 14).
- (5) Samson frees himself from the trap of Delilah (vv. 9, 12, 14).

<span id="page-641-2"></span>It is not known how long it takes Delilah to discover the secret of Samson's strength or if he ever actually encounters the Philistine ambush in her first three attempts. The prolonged guessing does portray Delilah as persistent in her quest for the Philistine bounty and also accords with the portrayal of Samson's wife in chapter 14, as she wept all seven days of the wedding feast over the secret of the riddle. The reason for Samson's choice of bowstrings, fresh ropes, and the braiding of his locks also remains a mystery, another riddle. These choices do, however, provide memorable details. Binding with bowstrings or fresh ropes makes sense in the context of ordinary life. The braiding of his seven locks, however, gets dangerously close to the truth of his strength. Twice Delilah complains that Samson is deceiving and lying to her (16:10, 13). This is ironic, since it is Delilah who is about to deceive and betray Samson.

<span id="page-641-10"></span><span id="page-641-9"></span><span id="page-641-4"></span>16:15 After three attempts to discover the secret of Samson's strength, Delilah pressures him into telling the truth by questioning his love for her. The very first thing we learn about Delilah in this account is that Samson loves her (v. 4). She is now putting this love to the test. This episode of provocation recalls the tactics employed by Samson's former wife, who complained, "You only hate me; you do not love me," for Samson had "not told" her what she wants to know (14:16). Delilah employs the same language here by questioning Samson's love, as he has "not told" her what she wants to know in order to betray him.

<span id="page-641-11"></span><span id="page-641-3"></span><span id="page-641-1"></span>16:16–17 Delilah is relentless in her pursuit of the secret of Samson's strength, "day after day" (or "all of the days"). The extreme nature of her inquiry is emphasized by three different Hebrew verbs: "pressed hard," "urged," and "vexed." The verbal construction translated as "vexed" is a Hebrew idiom normally expressing impatience and may be literally rendered "became short." For example, in 10:16 the Lord "became impatient" (his soul "became short") with Israel because of her idolatry (cf. Num. 21:4; Zech. 11:8). The translation "vexed" is appropriate because Samson is vexed "to [the point of] death." This way of speaking is similar to the way in which Jonah expresses his anger over the loss of the plant that has provided him shade from the sun: "God said to Jonah, 'Do you do well to be angry for the plant?' And he said, 'Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die" (Jonah 4:9).

<span id="page-641-13"></span><span id="page-641-12"></span><span id="page-641-0"></span>Delilah's extreme harassment of Samson finally causes him to reveal his secret to the woman he loves: "he told her all his heart" (repeated in Judg. 16:18 for

<span id="page-642-0"></span>emphasis). The references to his mother, the Nazirite vow, and the hair of his head correspond closely to those same elements in his birth account (13:5). With these references the author is preparing us for the climax of the Samson narrative and the fulfillment of his calling as judge from birth.

<span id="page-642-7"></span><span id="page-642-6"></span><span id="page-642-5"></span>16:18–20 As with the previous three attempts to discover the secret of Samson's strength, Delilah carries out the procedure described by Samson. In verse 18 she recalls the lords of the Philistines, who pay the prescribed bounty as she begins her final act of betrayal. The expression to "sleep on [someone's] knees" (v. 19) occurs only here in the Bible; its exact meaning is unknown. It could imply some sort of sexual activity, but such an interpretation is impossible to verify without additional evidence. We do know that Samson is enticed and seduced by the woman he loves, an apt characterization of Israel, who has been enticed and seduced by the gods of the surrounding nations. In verse 5 the Philistines came to Delilah in order to discover a way to "humble" Samson (cf. v. 6). In verse 19 Delilah begins to carry out this humiliation—the same verbal construction as in verse 5, now rendered "torment"—by causing his strength to depart. In the final sentence of verse 20 the narrator records that Samson is unaware that the Lord has departed from him, confirming that Delilah has indeed violated his Nazirite vow by shaving his head.

<span id="page-642-14"></span><span id="page-642-9"></span><span id="page-642-8"></span><span id="page-642-4"></span><span id="page-642-3"></span>16:21–22 This scene comes to an end with the record of Samson's capture, torture, and imprisonment by the Philistines. He has come to experience "chains and imprisonment" in order that he "might rise again to a better life" with all of God's people (Heb. 11:35–36). The narrator concludes with a statement of hope, indicating that Samson's hair has begun to regrow and thus hinting that Samson's strength may return.

<span id="page-642-10"></span>16:23–24 Pride comes before the fall. The Philistines assemble in the temple of Dagon to celebrate the capture and imprisonment of Samson. Their boast is repeated in each verse: "*our* god," "*our* enemy," "*our* hand." The Philistines attribute their success to the superiority of Dagon over the God of Israel, creator of heaven and earth. But nothing could be further from the truth. The author has already provided the lens through which these events must be interpreted: the events are "from the Lord, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines" (Judg. 14:4). Samson is right where the Lord wants him. The gathering in the temple will provide the perfect context for Samson's greatest victory over the Philistines. The description of Samson as the "ravager of our country" and the one "who has killed many of us" recalls the events of chapters 14–15 in the region of Timnah.58

<span id="page-642-12"></span><span id="page-642-2"></span><span id="page-642-1"></span>16:25–27 While celebrating in the temple of Dagon, the Philistines summon Samson to entertain them while they look on and mock. Exactly what type of entertainment Samson provides is unclear. Two different verbs are used to describe his actions. The first appears at the beginning of verse 25 and at the end of verse 27.

<span id="page-642-13"></span><span id="page-642-11"></span><sup>58</sup> For another instance in which the Lord mocks Dagon and his temple cf. 1 Samuel 5:1–12.

<span id="page-643-5"></span><span id="page-643-2"></span><span id="page-643-1"></span><span id="page-643-0"></span>In both instances it is translated "to entertain." One lexicon suggests the meaning "to amuse, entertain with jokes, serve as a joker."59 This may be a reflection of Samson's skill with riddles and poems, recorded in chapters 14–15. The second verb, a near homonym with the first, appears toward the end of 16:25 and is also rendered "to entertain." This verb is well known from the account of the birth of Isaac, when his parents "laughed" at the prospect of having a child at their advanced age (Gen. 17:17; 18:12–15). "Isaac" is a form of the verb "to laugh" in Hebrew, but it can also mean "to joke" or "to make fun" (cf. Gen. 19:14; 21:9).60 To the Philistines Samson has become the joke; his presence amuses them while they celebrate their victory over him. He was once a great terror, but now he requires a young man to hold his hand and lead him around in his blind and weak state. It is this weakness, however, that positions Samson in just the right location to deliver one last blow to the Philistines: between the pillars supporting the whole temple complex. The narrator pauses in Judges 16:27 in order to describe the number and location of the celebrants. The house is full of men and women, including the lords of the Philistines who bribed Delilah. Furthermore, some three thousand men and woman are on the roof, looking down on Samson. Thus perhaps as many as five to seven thousand people are present in the temple at its destruction.

<span id="page-643-7"></span><span id="page-643-6"></span><span id="page-643-3"></span>16:28 After Samson slew a thousand Philistine warriors with the jawbone of a donkey, he cried out to the Lord for help after being overcome with thirst and exhaustion (cf. 15:18). Now here Samson cries out to the Lord again in order that his strength might be restored one last time. Samson understands that this final feat of strength will be his last, as he asks for strength "only this once." He seeks to "be avenged," which could be woodenly rendered "be avenged with one act of vengeance." Thus with *one* act of vengeance will Samson be avenged for his "*two*  eyes." As hinted by the mention of the regrowth of Samson's hair (16:22), the Lord will answer his prayer and restore his strength one last time.

<span id="page-643-10"></span><span id="page-643-8"></span><span id="page-643-4"></span>16:29–30 These verses record one of the most iconic scenes in Judges. Samson's physical posture between the pillars, with his arms stretched forth, ready for death, should remind us of the way in which Jesus is lifted up to give his own life for his people. Additionally, Samson's statement ("Let me die with the Philistines") also reminds us of the context in which Jesus is crucified—in between those who truly deserve to die (Matt. 27:38). After Samson destroys the temple and those in it, the author states that Samson's greatest victory over the Philistines comes through his own death, an observation not to be overlooked in the interpretation of these events. Samson's death constitutes the fulfillment of his Nazirite vow. This has been God's plan from the very beginning and should not be considered a tragedy due to Samson's own sin or folly. When the angel of the Lord appeared to his parents, he clearly indicated that this "child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb *to the day of his death*" (13:7). Only a handful of individuals in the Bible see their birth, life,

<span id="page-643-9"></span><sup>59</sup> *HALOT*, 3:1315.

<sup>60</sup> Ibid., 3:1019.

and death each recorded in the interest of redemptive history: Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Samuel, John the Baptist, and finally Jesus himself. Though none but Jesus is sinless, these are men of faith who serve faithfully in the various administrations of the covenant of grace. Interpreters often neglect to consider Samson to be a part of this special group, but the author of Hebrews does not (Heb. 11:32).

<span id="page-644-6"></span><span id="page-644-3"></span>16:31 Samson's burial is honorable. We discover here that his mother's barrenness did not persist after his own miraculous conception and birth, for Samson had younger brothers. Together with the household of their father, these brothers retrieve and bury Samson in the tomb of their father, Manoah, between Zorah and Eshtaol, the very place where the Spirit of the Lord had first stirred Samson to fulfill his calling as judge (Judg. 13:25). The final statement in the Samson narrative brings this account to a conclusion by restating that he judged Israel for twenty years (cf. comment on 15:20 [the conclusion to the previous section]).

#### <span id="page-644-2"></span><span id="page-644-1"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-644-4"></span>Most modern commentators argue that the judges in Judges reflect the progressive corruption of Israel. Following the generation of Joshua, Judges carefully chronicles the nation's progressive decline into idolatry and immorality until she has become like the infamous cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (ch. 19). In a similar manner, it is argued, the judges reflect this same decline into corruption, beginning with Othniel as a good judge and finishing with Samson, the most morally corrupt of the judges. Gideon lacks faith and makes an idol that becomes a trap and snare for Israel in later years. Jephthah, the son of a prostitute, sacrifices his daughter. As for Samson, he marries a Philistine, sleeps with a prostitute, and foolishly loves a woman who betrays him. He is a man of violence, anger, revenge, and deception, with an incessant sexual appetite. Interpretations of this sort, however, seem to miss the point of the judge accounts and the testimony of the NT.61 The judges were raised up by the Lord, were enabled by the Spirit, and delivered God's people from the oppression that resulted from the corruption of their sin.

It is true that these men and women are sinners, each of them from birth. However, they are also men and women of faith, enabled by the Spirit to serve as covenant officials and types of Christ. The Lord, in his kindness, raises up these judges to deliver his people from the oppression of their enemies caused by their own idolatry. These judges serve the people of God at great risk to their own lives, provoking repentance from idolatry and faithfulness to the covenant. According to the book's own introduction in 2:16–19, these men and women are raised up *out of* Israel but are set apart *from* Israel, as was Noah in a day of global corruption.

<span id="page-644-5"></span><span id="page-644-0"></span>It is also important to remember the testimony of the NT. In Hebrews 11 the author selects four judges from the book in order to showcase their faith: Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah. Of all the judges, these four are considered the worst by most interpreters. Why not list Othniel, Deborah, and Ehud? There is much

<span id="page-645-5"></span>less scandal to overcome with these earlier judges. However, when it comes to the description of the judges recorded in Hebrews 11:32–40, Samson surpasses them all by the way in which his life accords with that testimony. He is the one "who *through faith* conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, [was] made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight" (Heb. 11:33–34). Was he not also "tortured, refusing to accept release, so that [he] might rise again to a better life" (Heb. 11:35)? Did not he also suffer "mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment" (Heb. 11:36)? Was he not also "afflicted" and "mistreated," forced to hide in the "caves of the earth" (Heb. 11:37–38)?

<span id="page-645-12"></span><span id="page-645-11"></span><span id="page-645-10"></span><span id="page-645-9"></span><span id="page-645-8"></span><span id="page-645-7"></span><span id="page-645-6"></span>How should we understand Samson? He is one "of whom the world was not worthy" (Heb. 11:38). He is a witness to the redemptive grace of God in Christ, who teaches us to respond by laying "aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and [running] with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith" (Heb. 12:1–2). Samson's (imperfect) faithful suffering for God's people is a type of Christ's (perfect) faithful suffering for that same people. This testimony is designed to encourage believers to respond to God's grace as we "consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood" (Heb. 12:3–4). Did not Samson do this very same thing? Even before his birth he was set apart by God for life. He was betrayed by those he loved, was handed over to the enemy, and suffered thirst, exhaustion, torture, imprisonment, and even death as he cried out to God so that he might fulfill his calling as judge and save God's people from the enemy ruling over them.

### <span id="page-645-3"></span>OVERVIEW OF JUDGES 17:1–21:25

#### *Conclusions to the Judges*

The third and final section of Judges contains two conclusions mirroring the two introductions in an A-B-B'-A' pattern (a chiasm).

- <span id="page-645-1"></span><span id="page-645-0"></span>(A) The Crisis of Israel's Inheritance: Land (1:1–2:5)
	- (B) The Crisis of Israel's Faith: Idolatry (2:6–3:6)
	- (B') The Crisis of Israel's Faith: Idolatry (17:1–18:31)
- <span id="page-645-4"></span><span id="page-645-2"></span>(A') The Crisis of Israel's Inheritance: Tribe (19:1–21:25)

This structure highlights Israel's ongoing infidelity to the Lord in the context of his repeated mercy. Even after God raises up twelve judges to deliver his people and secure rest for the land, Israel is unable to sustain repentance or to remove the Canaanites from the land of their inheritance. The scenes contained in this final section exemplify Israel's total corruption. The people have not loved the Lord with all of their heart, soul, or strength but instead have pursued persistent idolatry (section B); they have not loved their neighbors as themselves but have become sodomites and murderers (section A). The theme of this third major section is summarized in the well-known fourfold statement that also follows an A-B-B'-A' pattern, with the longer statements at the beginning and end and the shorter statements in the middle:

- (A) In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes (17:6).
	- (B) In those days there was no king in Israel (18:1).
	- (B') In those days, when there was no king in Israel (19:1).
- (A') In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes (21:25).

The first conclusion contains three scenes that are divided by the summary statements appearing above. The second conclusion also contains three major scenes, but in this section the summary statements bracket the accounts, employing the literary device known as inclusio. Although the two conclusions contain discrete accounts, they have been constructed in such a way that requires them to be read together. They share many striking features in common:62

- (1) Both conclusions contain a Levite as one of the central characters.
- (2) In the first conclusion the Levite is from Bethlehem of Judah and travels to the hill country of Ephraim. In the second conclusion the Levite is from the hill country of Ephraim and travels to Bethlehem of Judah.
- <span id="page-646-2"></span>(3) Both conclusions end with a reference to Shiloh (18:31; 21:19, 21).
- <span id="page-646-0"></span>(4) Both conclusions contain two summary statements (see above), a long statement and a short statement in each (17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25).
- (5) Both conclusions contain an act of war in which people are put to the ban (exterminated): the city of Laish (Dan) in the first conclusion and the cities of Benjamin along with the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead in the second conclusion.
- <span id="page-646-1"></span>(6) Both conclusions contain a reference to six hundred men of war from a particular tribe, from Dan (18:11) and from Benjamin (20:47).

In addition to there being no king in Israel at this time, neither do any judges appear in this final section. Without faithful leadership, the people are left to their own devices; this crisis becomes the background to the statement that "everyone did what was right in his own eyes."

<sup>62</sup> Cf. Webb, *Book of Judges,* 419–420.

### <span id="page-647-0"></span>JUDGES 17:1–18:31

17 There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. **2**And he said to his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the Lord." **3**And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, "I dedicate the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you." **<sup>4</sup>** So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah. **5**And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained*<sup>1</sup>* one of his sons, who became his priest. **<sup>6</sup>** In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

**<sup>7</sup>**Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. **8**And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. **9**And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place." **10**And Micah said to him, "Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living." And the Levite went in. **<sup>11</sup>**And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. **12**And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. **13**Then Micah said, "Now I know that the Lord will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest."

18In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them. **<sup>2</sup>** So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, "Go and explore the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. **3**When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?" **<sup>4</sup>**And he said to them, "This is how Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest." **5**And they said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed." **6**And the priest said to them, "Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the Lord."

behold, it is very good. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land. **10**As soon as you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is spacious, for God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth."

**<sup>11</sup>** So 600 men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, **<sup>12</sup>** and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan*<sup>3</sup>* to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. **13**And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.

**<sup>14</sup>**Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do." **15**And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him about his welfare. **16**Now the 600 men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate. **17**And the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war. **<sup>18</sup>**And when these went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?" **19**And they said to him, "Keep quiet; put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?" **20**And the priest's heart was glad. He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.

**<sup>21</sup>** So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the livestock and the goods in front of them. **22**When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the people of Dan. **23**And they shouted to the people of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company?" **24**And he said, "You take my gods that I made and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, 'What is the matter with you?' " **25**And the people of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household." **26**Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.

**<sup>27</sup>**But the people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. **28**And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to

Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it. **29**And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laish at the first. **30**And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses,*<sup>4</sup>* and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. **<sup>31</sup>** So they set up Micah's carved image that he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.

#### *Section Overview*

This first conclusion contains three scenes, each of which is followed by the summary statement that there was no king in the land at the time. Micah, from the hill country of Ephraim, is a central character in each of the three scenes. In the first scene he outfits a household shrine with cultic objects and ordains one of his sons to serve as priest. In the second scene he hires and ordains a Levite from Bethlehem of Judah to serve as priest in that shrine. Finally, in the third scene the Danites migrate north and steal Micah's cultic objects and the Levite to serve as priest for the tribe in its new settlement. The theme of this section is Israel's illegitimate worship of the Lord, including idolatry (syncretism). This theme is exemplified by way of contrast with reference to the place of worship. The narrative begins with reference to Micah's shrine, "a house of gods" in Hebrew (17:5). It concludes with reference to "*the* house of God" in Shiloh (18:31). When Israel entered the land, the people were commanded not to worship other gods and not to worship God in an illegitimate manner. This first conclusion documents Israel's clear violation of the first two commandments (Ex. 20:3–6; Deut. 5:7–10), in addition to many other violations of the covenant stipulations.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-649-3"></span><span id="page-649-1"></span>17:1 The first conclusion to Judges opens with reference to "a man." This is Micah, from the hill country of Ephraim. Micah serves as a central character in all three scenes of this first conclusion. The use of the Hebrew noun "man" plays an important literary role in this first scene. Together with the proper noun "Micah," it brackets the account in verses 1, 5. These references to Micah as a "man" connect his actions with the theological assessment that follows in verse 6, "Everyone did what was right in his own eyes," where the word rendered "everyone" is the same

<span id="page-650-2"></span>as that rendered "man" in verses 1, 5. In this way the actions of the "man" Micah are the actions condemned by the narrator, something upright in his own eyes but not in those of the Lord. All three scenes in this first conclusion are designed to illustrate the manner in which everyone was doing what was right in his own eyes.

<span id="page-650-4"></span><span id="page-650-1"></span>17:2–5 This first scene opens with Micah's confession of stealing "1,100 pieces of silver" from his mother, the same amount each of the lords of the Philistines paid to Delilah for her betrayal of Samson (16:5). The mother's response to this confession is unexpected: she pronounces a blessing on the son who has stolen from her. When Micah returns the silver to his mother, she dedicates it to the Lord by having a portion of it made into an idol, which is then kept in the house of Micah. Micah has another house: a "shrine" (v. 5; or, "a house of gods"). Not only does Micah have a shrine filled with idols and other cultic items, but he also ordains one of his own sons to serve as priest in this illicit shrine. Since Micah's son is not a descendent of Aaron or even a Levite at all, he is not permitted to serve as a priest according to the Mosaic covenant.

<span id="page-650-0"></span>The major theme of this first conclusion is Israel's idolatry in the period of the judges—the very sin permeating the narratives of the first sixteen chapters of the book (e.g., 2:11–13, 19; 3:5–7; 6:25–26; esp. 10:6–16). What this first scene teaches us is that idolatry comes with other besetting sins. For instance, the making and worshiping of idols violates the first two commandments. Micah's mother blesses her son in the name of the Lord (Yahweh) and also dedicates an idol to his name, clearly a violation of the third commandment by using the name of the Lord (Yahweh) in an inappropriate manner. Micah fails to honor his mother when he steals from her, a violation of the fifth and eighth commandments. It could also be argued that Micah steals the silver because he covets the wealth of his mother, a violation of the tenth commandment. In only four short verses the author of this account puts on full display the extent of Israel's corruption by documenting the violation of at least six of the ten commandments intended to govern the lives of God's people both in private and in public. On the surface, Micah and his mother may appear to be good, religious people. They walk the walk; they talk the talk. They bless in the name of the Lord; they give generously to him. This is the trap of the religious system of the human heart: it seeks to worship God in its own way and not according to what has been revealed in his word and stipulated in the covenant.

<span id="page-650-6"></span><span id="page-650-5"></span><span id="page-650-3"></span>17:6 This is the first of four such summary statements appearing in the conclusions to Judges (cf. Overview of 17:1–21:25). At the literary level, the first two summary statements mark transitions between each of the scenes in this first conclusion. At the redemptive-historical level, this statement anticipates the emergence of the monarchy in Israel, as recorded in 1–2 Samuel. At the theological level, this statement indicts Israel for rejecting the Lord as its King, resulting in corruption by becoming like all of the nations around it. The Lord was Israel's King, the one who would lead out in battle and deliver the enemy into the hand of his people.

<span id="page-651-7"></span><span id="page-651-1"></span>Gideon had objected to Israel's desire to make him King: "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you" (Judg. 8:23). The Lord himself makes the very same point when the people ask for a king later in 1 Samuel: "The Lord said to Samuel, 'Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, *but they have rejected me from being king over them*'" (1 Sam. 8:7). There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two parts of the statement recorded in this verse. There was no king in Israel; *therefore*, everyone was doing what was right in his own eyes. Israel's rejection of the Lord as its King is exemplified by its disobedience to the terms of the covenant, which is the cause of its corruption and subsequent oppression by the surrounding nations.

<span id="page-651-6"></span><span id="page-651-2"></span>17:7–9 In this second scene of the first conclusion to Judges we are introduced to a Levite from Bethlehem of Judah who travels to the hill country of Ephraim looking for work and a place to live. This Levite happens to cross paths with Micah, who queries him about his travels. The second conclusion to Judges begins with a Levite from the hill country of Ephraim who travels to Bethlehem of Judah—just the reverse of what occurs here (Judg. 19:1). This type of artistic repetition is one of the ways in which the author links the two conclusions. Each conclusion has its own distinct message (idolatry and inheritance), but they are connected by means of various literary devices such as this one. In this case, the connection between the two conclusions is one of cause and effect. The crisis of Israel's inheritance (the loss of a tribe) is the result of her idolatry and the additional besetting sins occasioned by false worship.

<span id="page-651-9"></span><span id="page-651-8"></span><span id="page-651-5"></span><span id="page-651-3"></span>17:10–12 Micah offers the young Levite both employment and housing. He desires for this Levite to serve as "a father and a priest" to his household. For these services Micah will compensate him with money, clothing, food, and shelter. Such an offer in the ancient world would have been difficult to refuse. The designation "father" in this context means "teacher," not a literal father (cf. 18:19). This is clear from the fact that the young Levite "became to him like one of his sons." The use of "father" for teacher is well known from the wisdom tradition of Proverbs 1–9, and Elisha uses this same designation for Elijah when the latter is taken up by chariots of fire into heaven (2 Kings 2:12). This idiom also appears in the NT teaching of Jesus (Matt. 23:8–10). In the end, the Levite accepts Micah's offer and is ordained as priest for the family of Micah, likely in the shrine Micah had built and outfitted with idols. In the previous scene Micah had ordained one of his sons to serve as family priest; it is unclear whether the Levite serves with Micah's son or replaces him. The Hebrew word translated "ordain" could be rendered "fill the hand" (cf. Ex. 28:41; 29:9, 29, 33, 35); this idiom signifies that the one ordained will receive his living (the filling of his hand) by his service as priest.

<span id="page-651-10"></span><span id="page-651-4"></span><span id="page-651-0"></span>17:13 Micah's assessment of the arrangement with the Levite betrays what has motivated him to build a shrine, make idols, and hire a Levite: he seeks to ensure that the Lord (Yahweh) will be good to him and prosper him. This is the heart of J udges 17:1–18:31 652

idolatry. Micah has constructed a religious environment in which and by which he thinks he can manipulate God. Rather than seeking the Lord according to the terms of the covenant, Micah sets up his own system of religion to provoke God's favor. Later, Samuel will condemn this very type of religion when Saul offers a sacrifice to ensure the favor of Lord:

 Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. (1 Sam. 15:22–23)

<span id="page-652-7"></span>It is ironic, therefore, that in the very next scene Micah will suffer the loss of his idols and his priest, the very system he has created to ensure his prosperity.

<span id="page-652-4"></span><span id="page-652-3"></span><span id="page-652-0"></span>18:1 The transition to the next scene in this first conclusion to Judges is marked by the second occurrence of the summary statement "In those days there was no king in Israel" (cf. comment on 17:6; Overview of 17:1–21:25). This next scene begins by repeating the opening phrase of the summary statement ("In those days") and records the migration of the tribe of Dan to the north and its encounter with Micah and the Levite during that migration. Dan was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, from Bilhah the maidservant of Rachel, who also bore Naphtali (Gen. 30:6; 35:25). The territory allotted by Joshua to the tribe is located on the Mediterranean coast north of Judah, south of west Manasseh, and west of Ephraim.63 The tribe of Dan, however, is unable to dispossess the inhabitants of that territory and so migrates north and occupies and renames the city of Leshem (Laish) in the northeastern region of Naphtali (Josh. 19:40–48).64

<span id="page-652-5"></span><span id="page-652-1"></span>18:2 Because Dan is unable to occupy its allotted portion of the land, the tribe sets out to find another suitable location. To do this it selects and sends out five men from its midst to explore the land. These men are from Zorah and Eshtaol, the same locations mentioned when the Lord began to stir up Samson to begin his service as judge (Judg. 13:25). During this exploratory expedition these five men happen to come across the house of Micah in the hill country of Ephraim, where they lodge during this portion of their journey.

<span id="page-652-6"></span><span id="page-652-2"></span>18:3–6 While staying with Micah these five men encounter the Levite, with whom they are already familiar. Like Micah, these men also employ the services of this false priest by asking him to inquire of the Lord for them regarding the disposition of their expedition. The priest provides a favorable response, but it is unknown how or why he comes to this assessment of the situation. Given the author's negative characterization of Micah and the Levite, we can perhaps conclude that the

<sup>63</sup> Cf. Currid and Barrett, *Crossway ESV Bible Atlas*, 107, map 4-13.

<sup>64</sup> Cf. ibid., 114–116, map 4.24.

Levite's positive response is intended to ingratiate himself to these men from Dan. As it turns out, the Levite will promote himself from serving as a family priest to serving as the priest of the tribe of Dan later in the account.

<span id="page-653-4"></span><span id="page-653-3"></span>18:7–10 After leaving the hill country of Ephraim and the house of Micah, the five spies come upon a flourishing and unsuspecting city, Laish (Leshem), in the very northern region of Israel's territory. The city is both prosperous and unprotected, exactly the type of city one would choose in such a situation. It would be easy to eliminate its inhabitants, and the spoils of war would prosper the victor. The spies return with their report and call out the Danites to go up and take the city, "for God has given it into your hands" (v. 10). The use of such language to justify one's actions is to be condemned as yet another violation of the third commandment, employing the name or reputation of God in a light or trivial manner. Micah's mother did so when she vowed to make an idol in the name of the Lord (17:3). The Levite did so when he offered blessing on the spies' journey using the name of the Lord (18:6). And now the Danite spies use this same tactic when calling their people out for war. In this final section of Judges Israel has rejected the Lord as her King and behaves in ways that seem right in her own eyes, but not in the eyes of the Lord.

<span id="page-653-10"></span><span id="page-653-5"></span><span id="page-653-2"></span><span id="page-653-1"></span><span id="page-653-0"></span>18:11–13 Six hundred men from Dan set out to take Laish. This is the same number of men from Benjamin who flee the battle in the second conclusion (20:47), providing another point of connection between the two sections. The Danites encamp near Kiriath-jearim and name that location "Mahaneh-dan" ("the camp of Dan"). This is the location at which the Spirit first stirred Samson (13:25). From this location the Danites return to the house of Micah. This encounter at the house of Micah receives considerable attention in the overall distribution of text and is a major focus of the narrative (18:14–26). It records the origin of illicit worship in Dan, which will later serve as the location of one of two golden calves set up by Jeroboam to prevent the people of Israel from worshiping at the temple at Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:26–30).

<span id="page-653-11"></span><span id="page-653-9"></span><span id="page-653-8"></span><span id="page-653-7"></span><span id="page-653-6"></span>18:14–20 The five spies divulge the known cultic contents at the houses of Micah to their fellow warriors and solicit their help in a plan to take the idols and also the Levite, to serve as their priest in their new city. The plan devised by the spies is not described but simply enacted, "Now therefore consider [know] what you will do" (Judg. 18:14). The plan consists of stealing the idols and the Levite with a show of force that will prevent Micah from retaining them. With the six hundred armed warriors standing guard at the gate of the city, the five spies remove the cultic items from the houses of Micah and march out in broad daylight. When the Levite asks about the situation, the warriors silence him and offer a promotion: "Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?" (v. 19). The priest is pleased with the offer and becomes the very one who takes the cultic objects from the city of his former employer. The Levite

J udges 17:1–18:31 654

<span id="page-654-4"></span><span id="page-654-3"></span>had become like a son to Micah (17:11), but now he betrays him with a willing and glad heart (v. 20). Theft, betrayal, and increased idolatry continue to display the ongoing corruption of Israel in the days of the judges.

<span id="page-654-6"></span><span id="page-654-5"></span><span id="page-654-2"></span>18:21–26 The Danites set out to Laish with the stolen property and priest of Micah. In response, the men living near the house of Micah are called out to confront the Danites regarding their theft. The Danites silence Micah and those with him with threats of force and loss of life. Because his neighbors are no match for the Danite warriors, Micah is forced to return home empty handed. The irony is that the man who stole "1,100 pieces of silver" (17:2) from his own mother now suffers from the very same crime. The real tragedy of Micah's idolatry, however, becomes painfully clear in 18:24. He proclaims, "You take my gods *that I made*." Micah has made his own gods, the work of his own hands, and worshiped what he has created rather than the one who created him. Moses warned Israel that this would happen: "In the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger *through the work of your hands*" (Deut. 31:29). This type of idolatry persists in Israel and is later condemned by the Lord through the prophet Isaiah:

<span id="page-654-0"></span> Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the *work of their hands*, to what their own fingers have made. (Isa. 2:8)

<span id="page-654-9"></span>The sin of idolatry is to worship what one has made with one's hands rather than rendering true worship to the one whose hands created the universe and fashioned humanity out of the dust. The Lord declared,

 I made the earth and created man on it; *it was my hands* that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host. (Isa. 45:12)

<span id="page-654-10"></span>Micah should perhaps have rejoiced in the kind providence of God that had arranged for the removal of this great evil from his household. Rather, with the loss of his gods and a priest to manipulate them he can only lament, "What have I left?" Micah's idolatry has blinded him to the wealth of being a part of God's covenant people and of the surpassing value of covenant life. The Lord longs for his people to worship and be satisfied. Idolatry of this type never satisfies. There is only one who can fully satisfy, as the psalmist reflects, "In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore" (Ps. 16:11).

<span id="page-654-8"></span><span id="page-654-7"></span><span id="page-654-1"></span>18:27–29 The account of Dan's resettlement is brief; only the most basic details are provided. The people of Dan execute the inhabitants of Laish, burn the city with fire, rebuild the city, and then rename it after their ancestor, Dan. This same event is recorded in Joshua 19:47. The people of Laish are described as quiet, trusting (unsuspecting), and without access to aid or assistance—details included in order to disparage the behavior of the Danites.

<span id="page-655-3"></span><span id="page-655-2"></span>18:30–31 The name of the Levite first encountered in Judges 17:7 is now revealed. Such a delay is undoubtedly intended to shock and surprise the reader. He is "Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses." The Hebrew for "son" can also indicate a more distant relative. Jonathan could be Moses' grandson but could also be a more distant descendent. Either way, the manner in which the author has constructed this brief genealogy is intended to portray how quickly idolatry and corruption spread throughout Israel in the days of the judges—even in the very family of Moses. This fact was considered so shameful by the scribes who preserved and transmitted the Hebrew Bible that they placed a small, superscripted *n* (*nun* in Hebrew) after the *m* (*mem* in Hebrew) in Moses' name to change the pronunciation of the word to "Manasseh."65 The idols, idolatry, and illicit priesthood will persist in Dan until the exile. In fact, at the advent of the divided kingdom Jeroboam will set up golden calves at Dan and Bethel to prevent the northern tribes from worshiping at the temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:26–30). Things will not get better in Israel; they will only go from bad to worse until the Lord must finally expel his people from the land. The reference to Micah's carved image brings to an end this first conclusion to Judges by recalling the original manufacture of the idol (Judg. 17:3–4). In a very real sense, the events recorded in chapters 17–18 could be characterized as the history of Micah's idol, created out of corruption and corrupting all those with whom it comes in contact.

#### <span id="page-655-5"></span><span id="page-655-1"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-655-4"></span><span id="page-655-0"></span>Together the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) demonstrate that the Lord is always faithful to his covenant promises (cf. Josh. 21:45; 1 Kings 8:56). On the other hand, they also demonstrate how Israel struggles to remain faithful to the Lord and to the covenant that regulates and maintains their relationship. This first conclusion to Judges puts on full display Israel's covenantal infidelity as exemplified by her idolatry, that is, her whoring after other gods while forsaking and forgetting the one true God. While idolatry in the modern world may not look like the idolatry of the ancient world, its essence and impact are the same. When we worship what we create with our own hands, we cease to worship the one who created all things. This is the substance of idolatry, the worship of the "work of human hands" (Ps. 115:4). In the ancient world the conduit for such worship took the form of actual idols made from wood, stone, or precious metals. The idols represented the false gods and served as points of access to ensure prosperity and blessing — but also to allow for immoral behavior such as cultic prostitution or child sacrifice as a means for manipulating the gods in one's favor.

<span id="page-655-7"></span><span id="page-655-6"></span><sup>65</sup> The change to Manasseh may characterize the deeds of this Levite as corresponding those of King Manasseh in 2 Kings 21:1–18; cf. Block, *Judges, Ruth*, 512.

<span id="page-656-1"></span>In light of this reality, Micah's goal in building a shrine, filling it with idols, and hiring a Levite to serve as his priest is clear: "Now I know that the Lord will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest" (Judg. 17:13). Micah set out to create a religious environment, all of it the work of human hands, in which he could control and manipulate God for his own benefit. The folly of idolatry is its impotence. By the end of this first conclusion Micah's shrine is empty and his priest gone. Where is the power or prosperity now? Could not the idols save themselves or protect Micah? One of the best descriptions of the impotence of idolatry is found in Psalm 115:5–8:

<span id="page-656-3"></span> They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them.

Idols may have the appearance of giving power and prosperity, but they are powerless. In fact, their result is just the opposite from that which is intended: rather than idols' promoting power and prosperity, they make their worshipers powerless and profane—just like they are. Every generation and culture has its own set of idols. Such idols may be related to technology, finances, relationships, possessions, achievement, fame, or any other work of human hands that cannot provide real or lasting security. There is only one place where true prosperity and lasting security may be found: at the foot of the throne of grace:

<span id="page-656-2"></span> You make known to me the *path of life*; in your presence there is *fullness of joy*; at your right hand are *pleasures forevermore*. (Ps. 16:11)

<span id="page-656-5"></span><span id="page-656-4"></span><span id="page-656-0"></span>But how do we get to this place? By yielding to and worshiping the one true image, Jesus: "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation" (Col. 1:15). The first two commandments were intended to protect God's people by forbidding both the worship of other gods and also the making of any image representing the one true God (Ex. 20:3–6; Deut. 5:7–10). For the true image was coming, and the worship of false images blinds our minds, making us unable to see the beauty or glory of the one true image. That is why we need "the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God" (2 Cor. 4:4). By God's grace, the light of his glory has overcome the darkness of our idolatry.

### <span id="page-657-0"></span>JUDGES 19:1–21:25

19In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. **2**And his concubine was unfaithful to*<sup>1</sup>* him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months. **<sup>3</sup>**Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house. And when the girl's father saw him, he came with joy to meet him. **4**And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there. **5**And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go." **<sup>6</sup>** So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl's father said to the man, "Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry." **7**And when the man rose up to go, his fatherin-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again. **8**And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl's father said, "Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines." So they ate, both of them. **9**And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home."

**<sup>10</sup>**But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him. **11**When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, "Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it." **12**And his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah." **13**And he said to his young man, "Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah." **<sup>14</sup>** So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, **<sup>15</sup>** and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night.

**16**And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibeah. The men of the place were Benjaminites. **17**And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city. And the old man said, "Where are you going? And where do you come from?" **18**And he said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to the house of the Lord, *2* but no one has taken me into his house. **19**We have straw and feed for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants. There is no lack of anything." **20**And the old man said, "Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants. Only, do not spend the night in the square." **<sup>21</sup>** So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.

**<sup>22</sup>**As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him." **23**And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing. **24**Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Violate them and do with them what seems good to you, but against this man do not do this outrageous thing." **25**But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. **26**And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, until it was light.

**<sup>27</sup>**And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. **<sup>28</sup>** He said to her, "Get up, let us be going." But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went away to his home. **29**And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. **30**And all who saw it said, "Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak."

20 Then all the people of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man to the Lord at Mizpah. **2**And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, 400,000 men on foot that drew the sword. **<sup>3</sup>** (Now the people of Benjamin heard that the people of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the people of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this evil happen?" **4**And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, "I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night. **5**And the leaders of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house against me by night. They meant to kill me, and they violated my concubine, and she is dead. **<sup>6</sup>** So I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed abomination and outrage in Israel. **7**Behold, you people of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here."

**<sup>8</sup>**And all the people arose as one man, saying, "None of us will go to his tent, and none of us will return to his house. **9**But now this is what we

will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot, **<sup>10</sup>** and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the people, that when they come they may repay Gibeah of Benjamin for all the outrage that they have committed in Israel." **<sup>11</sup>** So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.

**<sup>12</sup>**And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What evil is this that has taken place among you? **13**Now therefore give up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the people of Israel. **14**Then the people of Benjamin came together out of the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the people of Israel. **15**And the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities on that day 26,000 men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered 700 chosen men. **16**Among all these were 700 chosen men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. **17**And the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 men who drew the sword; all these were men of war.

**<sup>18</sup>**The people of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and inquired of God, "Who shall go up first for us to fight against the people of Benjamin?" And the Lord said, "Judah shall go up first."

**<sup>19</sup>**Then the people of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. **20**And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin, and the men of Israel drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah. **21**The people of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and destroyed on that day 22,000 men of the Israelites. **22**But the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day. **23**And the people of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until the evening. And they inquired of the Lord, "Shall we again draw near to fight against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?" And the Lord said, "Go up against them."

**<sup>24</sup>** So the people of Israel came near against the people of Benjamin the second day. **25**And Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed 18,000 men of the people of Israel. All these were men who drew the sword. **26**Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. **27**And the people of Israel inquired of the Lord (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, **<sup>28</sup>** and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, "Shall we go out once more to battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the Lord said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand."

**<sup>29</sup>** So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. **30**And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. **31**And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city. And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel. **32**And the people of Benjamin said, "They are routed before us, as at the first." But the people of Israel said, "Let us flee and draw them away from the city to

The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. **37**Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. **38**Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city **<sup>39</sup>** the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel. They said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle." **40**But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. **41**Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them. **42**Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst. **<sup>43</sup>** Surrounding the Benjaminites, they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah*<sup>4</sup>* as far as opposite Gibeah on the east. **44**Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor. **45**And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways. And they were pursued hard to Gidom, and 2,000 men of them were struck down. **<sup>46</sup>** So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword, all of them men of valor. **47**But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months. **48**And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, the city, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns that they found they set on fire.

21 Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, "No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin." **2**And the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. **3**And they said, "O Lord, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?" **4**And the next day the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. **5**And the people of Israel said, "Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the Lord?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death." **<sup>6</sup>**And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel this day. **7**What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives?"

**<sup>8</sup>**And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah?" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly. **9**For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. **<sup>10</sup>** So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones. **11**This is what you shall do: every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction." **12**And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

**<sup>13</sup>**Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and proclaimed peace to them. **14**And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them. **15**And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

**<sup>16</sup>**Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?" **17**And they said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel. **18**Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters." For the people of Israel had sworn, "Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin." **<sup>19</sup>** So they said, "Behold, there is the yearly feast of the Lord at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." **<sup>20</sup>**And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards **<sup>21</sup>** and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. **22**And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.' " **23**And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and lived in them. **24**And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.

**<sup>25</sup>** In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-661-2"></span><span id="page-661-1"></span><span id="page-661-0"></span>This final conclusion to Judges is bracketed by a form of the summary statement, "In those days, when there was no king in Israel" (19:1; 21:25). This conclusion comprises three scenes or episodes corresponding to its three chapters (cf. Section Outline). The general theme of this conclusion is Israel's inheritance and, as such, corresponds with the first introduction to the book (1:1–2:5). In that introduction the author described how Israel was unable to occupy successfully the land of its inheritance because it had violated the terms of the covenant with the Lord (2:1–3). This introduction also highlighted the relative success of the tribe of Judah, which was then contrasted with the failure of the tribe of Benjamin. In this conclusion the tribe of Benjamin becomes the focus of the narrative. The relatively negative portrayal of the tribe of Benjamin in the first conclusion is intensified and more fully developed here. Once again, the contrast between the tribes of Benjamin (negative) and of Judah (positive) prepares us for the advent of the monarchy in Israel and the first two kings appointed to reign, Saul the Benjaminite (from Gibeah) and David the Judahite (from Bethlehem). Both Gibeah and Bethlehem serve as important locations in this narrative account (e.g., 19:1–2, 12–14, 16, 18).

<span id="page-662-10"></span><span id="page-662-6"></span><span id="page-662-2"></span>In this conclusion the theme of Israel's inheritance focuses not so much on the land as on the virtual extinction of a tribe from the midst of the tribes of Israel. This theme is nicely summarized in Israel's prayer after putting Benjamin to the ban: "O Lord, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?" (21:3). According to the terms of the covenant (Ex. 23:23–33; Deut. 7:1–5), Israel was to drive out completely the Canaanites and the people of the land so that Israel would not become corrupted by the Canaanites' worship of false gods or their abominable practices. Having failed to eliminate the Canaanites from the land, Israel becomes more and more like the nations among whom she lives until one tribe, Benjamin, reenacts the tragic events of Sodom and Gomorrah (cf. Genesis 19). This is the author's way of characterizing the fullness of Israel's corruption. Those who were once God's "treasured possession" (Ex. 19:5) have become "Not My People" (Hos. 1:9).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-662-7"></span><span id="page-662-4"></span>19:1a For a discussion of the opening summary statement cf. Overview of 17:1– 21:25 and comment on 17:6.

<span id="page-662-8"></span><span id="page-662-5"></span>19:1b The events described here recall similar events in Judges 17:7–8. There, following the first summary statement, an unnamed Levite from Bethlehem of Judah sojourned and came to the hill country of Ephraim. Now here, following the third summary statement, an unnamed Levite sojourns in the hill country of Ephraim and then travels to Bethlehem of Judah. The traveling adventures of both Levites trigger the events that follow in each of the accounts. This literary device is one of the ways in which the author connects the two conclusions. For additional literary connections between these two conclusions cf. Overview of 17:1–21:25.

<span id="page-662-9"></span><span id="page-662-3"></span>19:2–3 The Levite's trip to Bethlehem of Judah is occasioned by the need to retrieve his unfaithful wife, who had returned to her father's house. The Hebrew verb <span id="page-663-4"></span><span id="page-663-3"></span>translated "was unfaithful" is the same verb rendered "whored" in 2:17; 8:27; and 8:33. In each of these instances Israel "whored" after idols and false gods and so abandoned the Lord. As such, the actions of the unfaithful wife exemplify Israel's relationship with the Lord during this time. Additionally, the Levite's desire to go after his unfaithful wife and to "speak kindly to hear and bring her back" epitomizes the Lord's treatment of Israel in each of the six major judge narratives. This account does not record the way in which the Levite's wife was unfaithful to him. Perhaps she simply abandoned him, forsaking the marriage covenant by returning to her father's house. If so, this may serve as a possible OT background for Paul's instructions concerning marriage and abandonment in 1 Corinthians 7:15.

<span id="page-663-12"></span><span id="page-663-8"></span><span id="page-663-7"></span><span id="page-663-6"></span><span id="page-663-5"></span>19:4–10 At the end of Judges 19:3, the father-in-law of the Levite was happy to see his son-in-law. This joy was expressed by an extended period of hospitality. The initial stay lasted three days (v. 4) before being extended to a fourth day (vv. 5–7) and then a fifth day (vv. 8–9). The father-in-law presses for yet another day, but the Levite declines, and his party sets out late on the fifth day. With the late start on the fifth day, they make it as far as Jebus, the city that will become Jerusalem, before seeking to find lodging for the evening. This lengthy account of the father-in-law's hospitality serves two functions. First, it demonstrates that the father-in-law is truly delighted to see his son-in-law, especially with the prospect of the restoration of his daughter's marriage. Second, it slows down the narrative and creates suspense regarding the events that will soon follow. It is the calm before the storm.

<span id="page-663-9"></span>19:11–15 Because it is getting late, the Levite's young servant suggests that the traveling party stay in the nearby city of Jebus (Jerusalem) for the night. The Levite's response constitutes the key verse in this scene: "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah" (v. 12). Rightly so, the Levite prefers to seek refuge among his own people, the "people of Israel." What we will discover, however, is that the Israelites in Gibeah are just as foreign as the inhabitants of Jebus—perhaps even more so.

<span id="page-663-11"></span><span id="page-663-10"></span><span id="page-663-2"></span><span id="page-663-1"></span><span id="page-663-0"></span>References to the city of Jerusalem also appear in the first introduction to Judges, the introduction that corresponds to this second conclusion by way of shared theme (inheritance). This is where Adoni-bezek died (1:7). More importantly, however, the city serves to highlight the contrast between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. In 1:8 "the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire." In 1:21, however, "the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day." The reference to the cohabitation of Jebusites and Benjaminites hints at the forthcoming corruption of this tribe, a state of corruption put on full display in this final conclusion. Additionally, when the people of Israel place the tribe of Benjamin under the ban, the Lord calls the tribe of Judah to "go up first" and lead in battle (20:18). This is yet another instance in Judges of the author's preparing us for the emergence of the monarchy in 1 Samuel, whereupon the contrast between Benjamin and Judah will reach its climax in the conflict between Saul and David.

<span id="page-664-5"></span>This particular scene comes to an end when the travelers arrive in Gibeah and sit down in the "open square of the city" (Judg. 19:15). This is the place where travelers in the ancient world would come to find lodging with one of the households in a city. It is telling, therefore, that not one Benjaminite from the city extends an offer of hospitality to the Levite and his traveling companions. This is yet another hint at the corruption of the inhabitants of the city, preparing us for the tragic events that soon follow.

<span id="page-664-6"></span><span id="page-664-4"></span>19:16–21 In the next scene an old man returning from a day of work in the field happens upon the Levite and his companions at the city square. This old man is not a native of the city but is a sojourner from the hill country of Ephraim, as is the Levite (v. 1). Perhaps because of this connection the old man extends a gracious offer of hospitality to the Levite, holding out peace, provisions, and shelter for the travelers. Having lived in the city as a sojourner, the old man is likely aware of the moral corruption of the men in that city. Thus he warns the Levite, "Only, do not spend the night in the square" (v. 20). Unfortunately, the protection of the household will not afford sufficient safety for the Levite's concubine.

<span id="page-664-8"></span><span id="page-664-7"></span><span id="page-664-3"></span>19:22–24 While the Levite's party is enjoying the hospitality of its host, the men of the city surround the house, beat on the door, and demand that the master of the house bring forth the Levite so that they can have intercourse with him. The Hebrew expression translated "worthless fellows" can also mean "wicked" or "goodfor-nothing" men. The term is used to describe someone who might lead another into idolatry (Deut. 13:13) or disregard the poor and needy (Deut. 15:9). The two sons of Eli are characterized in this way because "they did not know the Lord" (1 Sam. 2:12). Proverbs 16:27 is applicable to the events recorded here: "A worthless man plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire." The men of the city of Gibeah, worthless men, have indeed plotted evil in wanting to "know" the Levite, a euphemism used as a common expression for sexual intercourse. For example, in Genesis 4:1 it is recorded, "Now Adam *knew* Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain" (cf. Gen. 19:5; Num. 31:17; 1 Kings 1:4).

<span id="page-664-9"></span><span id="page-664-2"></span><span id="page-664-1"></span><span id="page-664-0"></span>The wickedness of this account cannot be overstated. The men of Benjamin have become sodomites! In fact, this account shares several features in common with the account of Sodom in Genesis 19:66

- (1) Travelers arrive at a town in the evening.
- (2) A host urges the guests not to spend the night in the town square.
- (3) The host is a sojourner, not a native of the city.
- (4) All of the men in the city surround the house.
- (5) The men of the city make the same demand of the host. The parallels are striking.

<sup>66</sup> For a similar list of comparisons cf. Block, *Judges, Ruth*, 520.

- <span id="page-665-1"></span>(a) Genesis 19:5: "Bring them out to us, that we may know them."
- <span id="page-665-6"></span>(b) Judges 19:22: "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him."
- (6) The host goes out to the men of the city and leaves the visitors in the house.
- <span id="page-665-2"></span>(7) The host pleads with the men of the city not to do this wicked thing. Again, the verbal parallels are striking.
	- (a) Genesis 19:7: "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly."
	- (b) Judges 19:23: "No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly."
- <span id="page-665-7"></span><span id="page-665-3"></span>(8) The host offers two women as a substitute for the men.
	- (a) Genesis 19:8: "Do to them as you please."
	- (b) Judges 19:24: "Do with them what seems good to you."
- <span id="page-665-8"></span>(9) The men of the city do not want the women as a substitute.
- (10) All the inhabitants of the city are eventually destroyed, and the city is burned with fire.

<span id="page-665-4"></span><span id="page-665-0"></span>The parallels are so numerous and overt that we are forced to read Judges 19 in light of Genesis 19. In this way, the author of the account vividly portrays the corruption of Israel as that which deserves divine, eschatological judgment. The Gibeahites are no better than the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah.

<span id="page-665-9"></span>19:25–26 In Genesis 19 the angels saved Lot and his family by striking the men of Sodom with blindness so that they were unable to commit their proposed acts of wickedness. Tragically, that does not occur here with the men of Gibeah. Rather, the host seizes the Levite's concubine and sends her out to the men of the city, who "knew her and abused her all night." This unspeakable cruelty impugns not only the men of Gibeah but also the man for handing over this woman to be sexually abused all night, even to the point of death. We do not know what happens to the host's virgin daughter; she is not mentioned again. It is likely, however, that this household is destroyed when the other tribes of Israel put this city to the ban.

<span id="page-665-10"></span><span id="page-665-5"></span>19:27–28 The next morning the Levite discovers his concubine at the threshold to the door of the house. She does not respond to him, and he finds that she is apparently dead. The author of the account does not provide us with the emotional response of the Levite or his interaction with the host in light of this tragic event. Some may think the account to be cold and emotionless, or that the Levite does not love the woman or care for her well-being. But nothing could be further from the truth when we recall how all of this started: she was unfaithful to him, but he went after her to "speak kindly with her and bring her back" (Judg. 19:3). He brought her a donkey on which to return home and provisions for the trip. The author does not provide us with the emotional response of the Levite, but does not mean he has none. He does. In fact, the events that follow are precipitated by the Levite's loss and his call for justice, that the life of his concubine be avenged.

<span id="page-666-9"></span><span id="page-666-4"></span>19:29–30 In response to the horrific events at Gibeah, the Levite summons all of Israel to avenge the life of his concubine. The men of Gibeah have shed innocent blood; as a steward of the Torah, the Levite would know the guilt and corruption of shedding innocent blood: "So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord" (Deut. 21:9). The Levite's call to arms is just as shocking as the events surrounding the death of his concubine. It is intended to typify the nature of the crime and the necessity of justice. The "twelve pieces" of the concubine represent the twelve tribes of Israel and indicate that the Levite is calling the whole nation to bear witness against the Gibeahites. The severity of the sin is summarized by the response of all who see the severed limbs of the concubine. Nothing like this has ever happened before in Israel.

<span id="page-666-11"></span><span id="page-666-5"></span><span id="page-666-0"></span>20:1–2 In response to the Levite's shocking call to arms, all the people of Israel respond by assembling at Mizpah. Laban named this site Mizpah when he and Jacob made a covenant and parted ways (Gen. 31:49); this is also the site where Israel assembled against the Ammonites under the leadership of Jephthah (Judg. 10:17). The references to Dan, Beersheba, and Gilead describe the extent of the summons: the people come from as far as Dan in the north, from Beersheba in the south, and even from the land of Gilead, east of the Jordan. At Mizpah the Levite musters a standing army of four hundred thousand men in order to avenge the death of his concubine. The author describes this group as "the assembly of the people of God," a designation found nowhere else in the OT.

<span id="page-666-16"></span><span id="page-666-15"></span><span id="page-666-14"></span><span id="page-666-13"></span><span id="page-666-12"></span><span id="page-666-10"></span><span id="page-666-8"></span><span id="page-666-7"></span><span id="page-666-6"></span><span id="page-666-3"></span><span id="page-666-2"></span><span id="page-666-1"></span>20:3–7 The Levite recounts the events of chapter 19 to the assembly of the people of God. Before he speaks, however, the author establishes the nature of the offense as "murder" (v. 4), the same word used in the Decalogue: "You shall not *murder*" (Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17). This is a clear violation of the moral law, also characterized as "evil" (Judg. 20:3), a designation common in Judges for the activity of Israel as those who do "that which is evil in the eyes of the Lord." In the Levite's speech he describes the actions of the men of Gibeah as an "abomination" and an "outrage" (v. 6). The Hebrew rendered "abomination" is frequently associated with egregious sexual sin (Lev. 18:17; 19:29; 20:14; Jer. 13:27; Ezek. 23:44), which would certainly apply here. The word rendered "outrage" was first used by the Levite's host when he pleaded with the men of Gibeah, "Do not do this *vile thing*" (Judg. 19:23), and again, "Do not do this *outrageous thing*" (19:24). This word is also associated frequently with sinful acts that are sexual in nature (Gen. 34:7; Deut. 22:21; 2 Sam. 13:12; Jer. 29:23). One lexicon suggests that this word conveys the idea of "willful sin, sacrilege."67 Indeed, the author's combination of words in these few verses condemns the sin of the men of Gibeah in the strongest possible terms. The Levite concludes his speech with a call to action similar to the one at the end of the previous chapter (Judg. 19:30).

<span id="page-667-7"></span>20:8–11 In response to the Levite's speech, the assembly of the people of God is united "as one man" and commits to avenge the murder of the Levites's concubine. A twofold plan is prepared. First, the people will go up against Gibeah "by lot," meaning at the direction of the Lord. Second, 10 percent of the assembly is appointed to carry the provisions for those who will fight. It will not be a quick battle. It will take some time, and so the assembly prepares to deal with this outrage and abomination. Although the fact is often overlooked, it is worth noting that four hundred thousand warriors in Israel have assembled to avenge the murder of an unfaithful, unnamed concubine. At a time in which many may not have valued the life of a woman as they should have, this display of outrage by the people of Israel over the death of a single woman is almost touching. It reminds us that everyone, both men and women, are created in the image of God (Gen. 1:27) and that the shedding of innocent blood is an offense against that very image (Gen. 9:5–6).

<span id="page-667-10"></span><span id="page-667-9"></span><span id="page-667-6"></span><span id="page-667-1"></span><span id="page-667-0"></span>20:12–17 Rather than giving the Gibeahites over to Israel to be put to death, the tribe of Benjamin assembles for war and joins itself to the wicked men of Gibeah. The focus here is on the numbers. The tribe of Benjamin has assembled twenty-six thousand warriors in addition to the seven hundred chosen men of Gibeah. These warriors are noted for their skill with the sling and their left-handedness (Judg. 20:16). The book's second major judge, Ehud, was also a left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin (3:15). The expression "left-handed" can be literally rendered "bound in the right hand." As such it is likely that these men were trained to fight with their left hand, a special skill in battle. The LXX translates this expression as "ambidextrous," meaning they could fight with either hand. Even with such skills, however, the tribe of Benjamin is badly outnumbered by the four hundred thousand warriors assembled from the other tribes of Israel. There are, on average, just over fifteen warriors from Israel for every one warrior from Benjamin.

<span id="page-667-11"></span><span id="page-667-8"></span><span id="page-667-3"></span><span id="page-667-2"></span>20:18 The camp of Israel moves out from Mizpah to Bethel in order to engage Benjamin at Gibeah. In verse 9 it was stated that Israel would go up against Gibeah by lot. Although the text is not explicit, it appears that the method by which Israel inquires of the Lord is the casting of lots (cf. Lev. 16:8; Josh. 18:6, 8, 10; 1 Sam. 14:42). The answer is clear: "The Lord said, 'Judah shall go up first.'" The Lord's choosing of Judah to go first against Benjamin continues the pro-Judah/ anti-Benjamin theme running through the book. The theme began in Judges 1 when Judah was chosen to go up first against the Canaanites (1:1–2). The point of connection is clear: the tribe of Benjamin has become a Canaanite tribe and must now be put to the ban, just as the Canaanites themselves were.

<span id="page-667-14"></span><span id="page-667-13"></span><span id="page-667-12"></span><span id="page-667-5"></span><span id="page-667-4"></span>20:19–23 The battle against Benjamin occurs over a period of three days. On day one (vv. 19–23) Israel suffers a great loss. On day two (vv. 24–28) Israel again suffers a great loss. Then, finally, on day three (vv. 29–36a) Benjamin is defeated. The Lord sanctioned Israel's war against the tribe of Benjamin (v. 18), and it is the Lord who <span id="page-668-2"></span>will ultimately strike down that tribe (v. 35). Verses 18, 35 constitute the theological lens through which to view the events recounted in between. The structure of the first two days is as follows: (1) the men of Israel engage Benjamin in battle, (2) Israel suffers great loss, (3) Israel weeps before the Lord, (4) Israel inquires of the Lord, and (5) the Lord sanctions the battle on the next day.

<span id="page-668-4"></span>On the first day of battle Benjamin strikes down 22,000 Israelites (v. 21). This is a staggering number, given that the army of Benjamin comprises only 25,700 warriors. The author does not explain how or why Israel experiences such a great loss on the first day. The focus is on the number itself. The humiliation and murder of the Levite's concubine was not a single sin with a single consequence. It has also provoked the rebellion of Benjamin, a whole tribe, and now the death of thousands of Israelites at the hands of their brothers. In spite of such a great loss, the men of Israel "took courage" (v. 22), and the Lord commands them to return to battle on the next day: "And the Lord said, 'Go up against them'" (v. 23).

<span id="page-668-7"></span><span id="page-668-6"></span><span id="page-668-5"></span><span id="page-668-3"></span>20:24–28 The events of the second day follow the pattern of the first (cf. comment on 20:19–23). There are, however, several interesting differences in the details. First, Israel suffers the loss of eighteen thousand men on day two. This brings the total number of Israelites killed in battle to forty thousand, another staggering number. After suffering this loss, the remaining Israelites return again to Bethel, where they weep before the Lord. This time, however, they also fast and offer sacrifices. Additionally, it is noted that both Phinehas and the ark of the covenant are in Bethel at this time. This is yet another hint as to the manner in which Israel inquires of the Lord. Previously, it was noted that Israel cast lots in order to determine how to proceed in battle (v. 9). Now we understand the importance of Bethel: it is the location of the ark and of the high priest who inquires of the Lord on behalf of Israel. Finally, the Lord again sanctions the battle on day three but this time promises victory for Israel after two tragic days of loss: "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand" (v. 28).

<span id="page-668-11"></span><span id="page-668-10"></span><span id="page-668-9"></span><span id="page-668-8"></span><span id="page-668-1"></span><span id="page-668-0"></span>20:29–36a The account of the battle on the third day does not follow the pattern of the first two days'. One major difference is the attention given to the ambush Israel sets against Benjamin. The account begins, "So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah" (v. 29). Israel engages Benjamin in battle as before, but this time it feigns defeat after suffering the loss of approximately thirty men. By withdrawing from the battle line, the Israelites lead the Benjaminites away from Gibeah to be ambushed by ten thousand chosen men of Israel. The account of this ambush is merely summarized in verses 29–36a; it is retold in greater detail in verses 36b–46. The accounting and recounting of a single event is a feature common to Hebrew narrative. The first account is usually brief and summarizes one or two important features related to the event. The second account rehearses the same event but in greater detail, with focus on a particular aspect of the event. For example, the account of day six of creation (Gen. 1:24–31) provides the initial summary of some of the more important events of that day. Then the author returns to rehearses the

<span id="page-669-1"></span><span id="page-669-0"></span>events of day six in greater detail, with an emphasis on the creation of the man and the woman and the origin of the marriage covenant (Gen. 2:4–25). In a similar fashion the account of Benjamin's defeat is summarized in Judges 20:29–36a but then retold in verses 36b–46 with greater attention to the ambush, pursuit, and defeat of the army of Benjamin.

<span id="page-669-5"></span><span id="page-669-2"></span>Another major difference on the third day is the fact that Israel defeats Benjamin with the loss of 25,100 Benjaminites—all but six hundred of their warriors. These six hundred will escape to the rock of Rimmon (v. 47); their fate is described in the upcoming and final chapter of Judges. Most commentators have identified a minor discrepancy in the number of slain Benjaminites listed in verses 35 and 46. Verse 35 states that 25,100 Benjaminites died on that day, whereas verse 46 states that only twenty-five thousand Benjaminites died, a difference of one hundred men. A variety of possible solutions to this apparent discrepancy have been offered. Some understand the first number to be the exact count and the second number a generalized summary statement. However, this seems unlikely, given the author's care and precision with other numbers in this account. Another possible solution suggests that the missing one hundred men of Benjamin would have died on the first two days of battle. This solution makes good sense and preserves the integrity of the text, though it is surprising that more Benjaminites did not perish on the first two days, given the losses suffered by Israel.68

Finally, it is important to consider the juxtaposition of the facts that "the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day" and that "the Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel" (v. 35). The loss of over sixty-five thousand lives is certainly tragic. But it is also under the sovereign, providential supervision of the Lord as he administers his covenantal kingdom. The deaths put on full display the corruption and destruction caused by sin. They also demonstrate the extent to which the Lord is willing to go in order to remove sin and sinful activity from the midst of his people.

<span id="page-669-3"></span>20:36b–40 The narrative now pauses to rehearse the ambush of day three in greater detail. In this first scene the author recounts how the men of Israel led the men of Benjamin away from Gibeah so that the ambush could take the city. The men of Israel feigned defeat and began to retreat. The men of Benjamin thought they were about to have another day of victory over their brothers. This time, however, the ambush snuck into the city behind the pursuing Benjaminites and put Gibeah to the sword, killing all of its inhabitants and setting the city on fire. The smoke from the fire signaled to the men of Israel that the city had been taken and that there was no refuge or retreat for the army of Benjamin.

<span id="page-669-4"></span>20:41–46 This next scene describes the defeat of the army of Benjamin in three stages. Once the men of Israel saw the smoke of the city, they turned to engage the men of Benjamin, moving from defense to offense. After cutting off Benjamin's return to Gibeah, Israel struck down eighteen thousand men east of Gibeah. Then

<sup>68</sup> Cf. Webb, *Book of Judges*, 493–494; Chisholm, *Commentary on Judges and Ruth*, 503–504.

Israel pursued Benjamin to the rock of Rimmon (Hb. for "pomegranate"), where an additional five thousand were killed. Finally, Israel pursued Benjamin to Gidom, where they struck down the last two thousand men, bringing the total number killed of the army of Benjamin to twenty-five thousand.69

<span id="page-670-3"></span>In verse 43 it is recorded that Israel surrounded the Benjaminites and then pursued them as they defeated them in battle. The ESV represents an excellent translation of this verse as it stands. However, it is difficult to imagine how Benjamin could have fled if it was surrounded by the army of Israel. One possible solution comes from the LXX, which translates the Hebrew verb meaning "to surround" as "to cut off." In other words, Benjamin was cut off by the ambush in Gibeah and so could not return to the city in order to take refuge. As such, the warriors were forced to flee into the open. The LXX rendering could be supposed via minor variation to the Hebrew text. The verb translated "to surround" is *ktr*; switching the second and third letters yields *krt* ("to cut off"). The Hebrew verb *ktt* ("to crush to pieces") has also been suggested as a possible reading.70

<span id="page-670-4"></span>20:47 These six hundred men now constitute the remnant of the army of Benjamin and soon the remnant of the entire tribe of Benjamin. After hiding in caves at the rock of Rimmon for four months, they will emerge as subjects of the final chapter of the book.

<span id="page-670-5"></span><span id="page-670-0"></span>20:48 The horror of the events recorded in this verse cannot be overstated. After defeating the army of Benjamin, the Israelites return to destroy the cities, people, and livestock of the entire tribe of Benjamin. Because Benjamin has become Canaanite in its actions, it is put to the ban as all the other Canaanites in the land were. This means the total destruction of every living thing: remaining men, women, children, and livestock, along with the complete destruction of Benjamin's cities. The regulations of the ban are stipulated in Deuteronomy 7:1–10, which includes no allowance for mercy. Under the terms of the Mosaic covenant and in the context of the (temporary and typological) Land of Promise, the Lord "repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face" (Deut. 7:10). This is a stark and startling reminder of the nature of the final, eschatological judgement to come. It should provoke us to examine our hearts and then to rejoice in the gospel of Jesus Christ, who suffered the curse of the ban on our behalf so that those who once hated the Lord could be made to love him by the power of his Spirit.

<span id="page-670-6"></span><span id="page-670-2"></span><span id="page-670-1"></span>21:1 At the Levite's call to arms, all of the people of Israel had come out and assembled at Mizpah, where the Levite had explained what had taken place in Gibeah of Benjamin (Judg. 20:1–3). We now learn that the people of Israel had made two vows before the Lord concerning their battle with Benjamin. First, no Israelite

<sup>69</sup> For discussion of this number versus the 25,100 men mentioned in Judges 20:35 cf. comment on 20:29–36a.

<sup>70</sup> *HALOT*, 2:506–507; Block, *Judges, Ruth*, 566n358.

<span id="page-671-9"></span><span id="page-671-5"></span>would give his daughter to any surviving Benjaminite in marriage (21:1, 7). Second, the people of Israel would put to death anyone who did not arise and fight to avenge the death of the Levite's concubine (v. 5). This created both a problem and an opportunity. The six hundred surviving Benjaminites would not be able to take wives from Israel, and the tribe would eventually perish upon the death of these survivors; however, wives could be acquired from those who did not come out to Mizpah for the assembly. It is grievous that Israel's insistence that Benjamin not marry women from other tribes comes in the context of Israel's own inability to obey the Lord's command not to take Canaanite wives (3:5–6). Everyone was truly doing what was right in his own eyes.

<span id="page-671-7"></span><span id="page-671-6"></span><span id="page-671-4"></span><span id="page-671-2"></span>21:2–4 The people of Israel return to Bethel and weep before the Lord. This recalls Israel's response to having suffered great losses on the first two days of battle (20:23, 26). This time, however, the weeping intensifies as they weep "bitterly" (or "a great weeping"). Judges 21:3 provides the reason for the weeping: the people are now concerned that one of their own tribes will be cut off from Israel. The emphasis on tribal solidarity is highlighted by the three references to "Israel" in this verse, including in the title of Yahweh as the "God of Israel." It is surprising that the people of Israel had not considered this possibility before the battle, given that the Lord had sanctioned the extermination of Benjamin on three different occasions (20:18, 23, 28). Nevertheless, in response the people build an altar and offer offerings on the next day (21:4). This certainly seems like an appropriate response, but in fact it is little more than a baptizing of their own plans in a certain amount of external religion in order to justify their upcoming actions.

<span id="page-671-11"></span><span id="page-671-10"></span><span id="page-671-8"></span><span id="page-671-3"></span>21:5–7 In verse 7 the people of Israel address the dilemma of wives for the tribe of Benjamin. Verse 6 provides the reason: "Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother." Verse 5 hints at the solution to their dilemma with its reference to a second oath taken at Mizpah. This was not just any oath but a "great oath" by which they would put to death anyone who had not attended that assembly. It appears the Israelites have identified a loophole that will allow them to provide wives for the surviving Benjaminites without violating their vow. This workaround provides the background and context for the upcoming events.

<span id="page-671-12"></span><span id="page-671-1"></span><span id="page-671-0"></span>The reference to Israel's compassion for Benjamin appears both here in verse 6 and in verse 15. This compassion is eventually expressed in the slaughter of Jabesh-gilead and the stealing of women as wives for Benjamin. In the regulations concerning the ban (holy war), the people put under the ban are to be completely destroyed, with no survivors: every man, woman, child, and animal (Deut. 7:1–11). Additionally, the regulations stipulate, "You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them" (Deut. 7:2). Thus the sparing of the remnant of Benjamin and the provision of wives is a clear violation of the stipulated sanctions. It appears that Israel's compassion is misplaced; the people should have finished the job they started by putting to death the survivors taking refuge at the rock of Rimmon. The tribe of Benjamin will later become a snare for Israel in the establishment of

<span id="page-672-7"></span>the monarchy and the selection of its first king, a king like all the other nations' (1 Sam. 8:5, 20).

<span id="page-672-2"></span>21:8–12 The Israelites devise a plan to solve the problem created by one oath by enacting the curse of the second, involving the complete destruction of those who had not come up to the assembly at Mizpah. When the people are mustered, or counted, it is discovered that the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead had not come up to the assembly. Israel thus plans to put these people to the ban but to keep alive any young virgins who could be given as wives to the remnant of Benjamin. In other words, they plan to solve the problem created by putting Benjamin to the ban by putting the people of Jabesh-gilead to the ban. In each instance, however, the ban is not complete, and violation is heaped upon violation in a land in which everybody is doing what is right in his own eyes. In the end, they are able to collect four hundred young virgins from Jabesh-gilead for the six hundred survivors of Benjamin. The deficit of two hundred wives provides the background and context for the events that follow.

<span id="page-672-4"></span><span id="page-672-3"></span><span id="page-672-1"></span><span id="page-672-0"></span>21:13–15 The Israelites return to the rock of Rimmon and proclaim peace or reconciliation (Hb. *shalom*) to the six hundred survivors of Benjamin. This proclamation is attended with the presentation of four hundred virgins from Jabesh-gilead as wives for the survivors. But the obvious is stated: "They were not enough for them" (Judges 21:14). This statement provides the background and context for the upcoming and final scene of the book and also serves as the final link in the chain of events spanning chapters 19–21. The reason for Israel's offer of peace and change of heart is explicitly stated in 21:15, which is a restatement of verse 6: "The people had compassion on Benjamin because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel" (v. 15). Once again the author makes clear that it was the Lord himself who had sanctioned the complete destruction of Benjamin, just as he had with the Canaanites, who were also to be completely removed from the land because of their abominable practices. One of the major points of this final conclusion to Judges is that Israel's progressive corruption and sin will eventually result in her own destruction and exile. The destruction of Benjamin serves as both a warning and a harbinger of things to come in the economy of the kingdom of God.

<span id="page-672-5"></span>21:16–18 The elders of the congregation scheme to make up the difference between the six hundred survivors and four hundred virgins so that "a tribe [will] not be blotted out from Israel." There is, however, the dilemma created by the oath taken in Mizpah. Israel cannot *willingly* provide wives for Benjamin without coming under the curse of the oath. Another loophole in the oath must be found in order to provide wives without coming under the curse.

<span id="page-672-6"></span>21:19–22 The plan is one of ambush and abduction. This is the second ambush in this final conclusion to Judges. In the first instance the army of Israel set an ambush to take Gibeah. In this second instance the survivors of Benjamin set an ambush to take wives from Shiloh. The plan is simple. At the feast of the Lord in Shiloh,

<span id="page-673-9"></span><span id="page-673-6"></span>the men of Benjamin will lie in wait for those virgins who come out of the city dancing in the procession. They will then abduct the girls and abscond to the land of Benjamin. When the families of the stolen girls come out to protest, the elders of the Israelite congregation will convince the families to yield to the offense so that they will not become guilty of breaking the oath and falling under its curse. The loophole is in the fact that the families of Shiloh will not *willingly* give their daughters in marriage to Benjamin. The Hebrew verb rendered "snatch" (v. 21) appears only here and then twice at Psalm 10:9, again in the context of a deceitful ambush and the activity of the wicked: the evil man "lurks that he may *seize* the poor; he *seizes* the poor when he draws him into his net." These young women are abducted by the wicked in a time in which everyone is doing what is right in his own eyes. The rape and death of the Levite's concubine led to the decimation of the tribe of Benjamin and the death of tens of thousands of Israelites. These events then led to the extermination of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead and the abduction of four hundred virgin daughters, which then required the ambush and abduction of two hundred virgins from Shiloh—sin upon sin, tragedy following tragedy.

<span id="page-673-7"></span><span id="page-673-5"></span>21:23–24 The enactment of the plan is not described but is merely stated in what the author must intend to be the ominous silence of condemnation. It is simply recorded that the people of Benjamin "did so" and then "returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns" Israel had destroyed in its war against Benjamin. The events of chapters 19–21 have come to their end, and the author notes that Israel disbands and returns home, "every man to his inheritance." This echoes the conclusion to Joshua: "So Joshua sent the people away, *every man to his inheritance*" (Josh. 24:28; cf. Judg. 2:6). But the assessment of Joshua's day is not what we find in Judges. At that time, "Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the Lord did for Israel" (Josh. 24:31). But in Judges Israel has served the gods of the land, forgetting the Lord and forsaking the covenant (Judg. 2:1–2, 11–20). It is the time in which everyone has done what is right in his own eyes.

<span id="page-673-8"></span><span id="page-673-3"></span><span id="page-673-2"></span><span id="page-673-1"></span>21:25 The book concludes with the fourth and final summary statement that shapes and controls the content and interpretation of the two conclusions to the book. For a discussion of the placement and significance of this statement cf. Overview of 17:1–21:25 and comment on 17:6.

#### <span id="page-673-4"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-673-0"></span>The first conclusion to Judges focused on Israel's idolatry. This second conclusion focuses on the *impact* of Israel's idolatry. Idolatry does not consist simply of worshiping other gods; it also takes the form of living like those people who worship other gods. Israel was warned of this danger when Moses declared, "You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way, for every abominable thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods, for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods" (Deut. 12:31). Judges records the progressive corruption of Israel through idolatry from the time of Joshua to the advent of the monarchy in 1 Samuel. In these final chapters the corrupting power of idolatry is exemplified by the complete corruption of Benjamin. The Benjaminites have become sodomites, resulting in the horrific rape and murder of the Levite's wife in Gibeah of Benjamin. From this event flows all of the other events of this section.

<span id="page-674-0"></span>The sins of Sodom in Genesis 19 provoked God's judgment, the complete destruction of the city and its inhabitants as a type or intrusion of the eschatological judgment to come. In a similar manner God sanctions the complete destruction of Benjamin by Israel, putting them to the same ban as any other Canaanite tribe in the land of Israel's inheritance. However, just as Israel was unable fully to drive out the Canaanites, so are they unable to destroy completely the tribe of Benjamin. With their misplaced compassion, the Israelites spare the six hundred survivors of Benjamin and provide them with wives by slaughtering the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead and recommending the stealing of virgins from Shiloh. It is difficult to imagine living in this place at this time. These events would be horrifying to witness in a time of anarchy and terrifying violence. As with the remaining Canaanites, the preservation of the tribe of Benjamin will become a snare to the people of Israel in the establishment of the monarchy. Israel will reject the Lord as her King and ask for a king like all the other nations. The Lord will give them exactly what they ask for, a king from the tribe of Benjamin, a Canaanite tribe like all the other nations. Even Saul's name plays a role in this situation. It means "what was asked for." The people ask for a king like all the other nations, and God gives "what was asked for." This is one reason to be thankful that the Lord does not give us everything we ask. It is an act of love and mercy on his behalf not to do so.

<span id="page-674-3"></span><span id="page-674-2"></span><span id="page-674-1"></span>The corrupting power of idolatry is that it makes us become what we worship, in terms both of behavior and of judgment (Ps. 115:8). The Lord created us to be like this, to reflect what we worship. God created humanity to worship, and we cannot help but do it. The conclusions to Judges warn us about the corrupting power of misdirected or misguided worship. It blinds us from seeing the glory of the one true God (2 Cor. 4:4). But we have great hope because of the gospel. Those who have been ransomed from the darkness of idolatry are now being transformed into the image and likeness of Jesus, becoming more and more like him through worship. Even now "we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit" (2 Cor. 3:18).

#### INTRODUCTION TO

# RUTH

#### *Overview*

<span id="page-679-2"></span><span id="page-679-1"></span>The book of Ruth celebrates the Lord's sovereign rule over his people in an age marked by spiritual and moral anarchy. That the plot unfolds "in the days when the judges ruled" (1:1) points to the book's universal relevance. This period in Israel's history, recounted mostly in the book of Judges, is characterized by a recurring cycle: the covenant community rebels against its covenant Lord, often through idolatry; the Lord consequently judges his people, often by handing them over to a foreign oppressor; the covenant community sometimes responds by crying out to the Lord for deliverance; the Lord graciously raises up a deliverer, often a judge; after being delivered, the nation rebels against the Lord even more defiantly (e.g., Judg. 2:10–19; cf. Ps. 106:34–46).

<span id="page-679-0"></span>As this cycle repeats, Israel deteriorates. The book of Judges thereby illustrates that, apart from the Lord's merciful intervention, the covenant community's chronic waywardness would imprison them to inevitable decline and eventual oblivion. Against this dark backdrop, the book of Ruth highlights the Lord's mercy to advance his salvation purposes even when his people seem to be in moral freefall. The Lord even uses his people's wanderings and afflictions to fulfill his promises to bless and stabilize them and to give light to those who sit in darkness (cf. Isa. 9:2; Luke 1:79; 2 Cor. 4:6).

<span id="page-679-6"></span><span id="page-679-5"></span><span id="page-679-4"></span><span id="page-679-3"></span>More specifically, the narrator recounts the Lord's providential mercy toward widowed, childless, discouraged Naomi. The story features the Lord's loving kindness to fill bereft Naomi through the loyal love of his faithful servants, Ruth and Boaz. The book's introduction (Ruth 1:1–5) vividly portrays Naomi's "emptiness" (cf. 1:21) in terms of her lack of immediate and long-range security. A famine afflicts Bethlehem ("house of bread"), which incites Naomi's husband, Elimelech, to leave Judah and sojourn in Moab with Naomi and their two sons. In Moab, tragedy strikes Naomi when Elimelech dies, followed by her two sons, who each had married a Moabite woman. Naomi is thus left without a husband or sons in a society in which legal and economic security depend upon having a male family member. She interprets her suffering as evidence of divine disfavor and despairs of any prospect of being restored (1:11–13, 20–21). Her despondent emptiness constitutes the plot's central predicament.

<span id="page-680-6"></span><span id="page-680-5"></span><span id="page-680-0"></span>On the whole, the plot progresses from famine, death, and emptiness (Ruth 1) to feasting, life, and fullness (Ruth 2–4), all on account of the Lord's sovereign kindness. The curtains close on scene 1 with Naomi's bidding the Bethlehemite women to call her "Bitter" (1:20; cf. ESV mg.). Naomi's speech sets the stage for the Lord's restoration of her. Indeed, the curtains close on scene 4 as the Bethlehemite women bless the Lord for restoring Naomi's fortunes by giving her baby Obed, her "redeemer." The storyline thereby exposes Naomi's miscalculation in scene 1: the Lord is not against her but is actively working on her behalf to bless her even beyond what she can see.

<span id="page-680-7"></span><span id="page-680-4"></span>Although sometimes the narrator describes the Lord's direct action to restore Naomi (e.g., 4:13), mostly the Lord's mercy is recounted as it is mediated through his obedient servants. The main human instruments by whom the Lord resolves Naomi's predicament are Ruth and Boaz. Ruth is Naomi's widowed, Moabite daughter-in-law who clings to Naomi on the road from Moab to Bethlehem (1:14– 17). Boaz is a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech. These two faithful servants embody self-sacrificial, covenant kindness. Boaz secures the redemption right to marry Ruth and perpetuate the name of the deceased in Naomi's family. The Lord grants conception to Ruth so that she bears a son, Obed, the heir by whom Naomi will once again experience lasting nourishment and legacy.

<span id="page-680-9"></span><span id="page-680-3"></span><span id="page-680-2"></span>The book's final verses expand the narrative horizon and shock first-time readers and listeners: baby Obed becomes King David's grandfather! The Lord resolves Naomi's bitter predicament (Ruth 1:1–4:17a) in a manner that precipitates the resolution of the entire nation's predicament (4:17b–22). Through Obed the Lord ultimately raises up his anointed servant, David, by whom the Lord grants rest (1:9; 3:1) to the whole covenant family (cf. 2 Sam. 7:11). The book's double ending (Ruth 4:13–17, 18–22) thereby drives home the trustworthiness of the Lord's loving kindness to his people. He even uses their affliction to multiply their blessing. In this way the book inspires God's people to trust his sovereign grace, even when dark circumstances seem to obscure his presence.

#### <span id="page-680-8"></span>*Title and Author*

The book's title bears the name of one of its main characters, Ruth, the Moabite widow whom Boaz marries. Ruth exemplifies covenant kindness by devoting herself to her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi, to Naomi's people, and to her God. As with most OT narratives, the book of Ruth nowhere identifies its author. Various possible authors have been proposed throughout history, such as Samuel or Solomon,1 but certain identification of the author is not possible.

#### *Date and Occasion*

<span id="page-680-1"></span>The book nowhere specifies when it was written. The drama occurs "in the days when the judges ruled" (1:1), that is, the era in Israel's history following Joshua's

<span id="page-680-10"></span><sup>1</sup> The Babylonian Talmud claims Samuel composed the book of Ruth, which seems unlikely since Samuel died (1 Sam. 25:1) before David ascended the throne (2 Sam. 2:4; 5:1–5). The Hebrew canonical tradition that places Ruth between Proverbs and Song of Solomon may reflect a view of Solomonic authorship, since the initial superscriptions in Proverbs and Song of Solomon explicitly name Solomon.

death (c. mid-14th century or late-13th century BC) and prior to Samuel's anointing of Saul (c. mid-11th century BC). The book reaches its final form, however, after David's anointing as king (c. 1010 BC), which the genealogical epilogue clarifies by identifying Ruth and Boaz as David's great-grandparents (4:17b–22).

<span id="page-681-3"></span>But at what point after David's anointing was Ruth written? The most common proposals concentrate on the early monarchical and postexilic eras. Regarding the former, the book's concluding Davidic focus leads some to propose a likely compositional date during Solomon's reign.2 In this view, the author aims to support the Davidic dynasty by confirming the legitimacy of David's ancestry. More specifically, the author demonstrates that, although Ruth is ethnically Moabite, she fully embraces the God of Israel and his covenant people; and, although Boaz is not Elimelech's nearest kinsman, he faithfully observes Israel's laws and customs to acquire the redemption right. However, some prefer a postexilic milieu for the book of Ruth, perhaps in the early restoration period.3 In this view, the author is reacting to supposed excessive reforms enacted by Ezra and Nehemiah and to negative attitudes toward foreigners, particularly Moabites (cf. Ezra 9–10; Neh. 13:3, 23–29).4 Certainly a postexilic compositional date would add texture to the emphasis in Ruth 1 on "returning" to Canaan after an extended period of relocation. In sum, while both the early monarchical and the postexilic proposals yield interesting possibilities regarding the author's specific occasion and purpose, conclusions on the matter must remain tentative. Fortunately, comprehensive knowledge of the book's date and occasion is not required for discerning critical aspects of its purpose (cf. Overview; Theology of Ruth).

#### <span id="page-681-6"></span><span id="page-681-5"></span><span id="page-681-0"></span>*Genre and Literary Features*

<span id="page-681-7"></span>The book of Ruth is narrative literature. Biblical stories recount historical facts, develop fascinating characters, and illustrate principles. But above all they aim to reveal God's character and ways by displaying his glory (cf. Ps. 145:4–9). Every biblical narrative contributes to the Bible's metanarrative, which principally discloses God's eternal purpose to redeem his people by his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Accordingly, Ruth's narrator renders true history with consummate literary artistry and a decidedly theological agenda.

<span id="page-681-4"></span><span id="page-681-2"></span><span id="page-681-1"></span>The book of Ruth consists of a plot introduction (1:1–5), four main scenes (1:6– 22; 2:1–23; 3:1–18; 4:1–12), a plot resolution (4:13–17), and a genealogical epilogue (4:18–22). The introduction and scene 1 disclose the drama's central conflict, namely, Naomi's multifaceted and despondent emptiness. Scenes 2–4 and the plot resolution develop the storyline, intensify suspense, bring the dramatic tension to a climactic turning point, and portray the resolution of the central conflict. The genealogical epilogue underscores the drama's significance in redemptive-historical terms.

<span id="page-682-6"></span><span id="page-682-3"></span>In terms of narrative time, the setting (1:1–5) covers about a decade, while the central drama (1:6–4:17) involves about a year (one harvest season plus about nine months). The concluding genealogy spans many generations, from Israel's patriarchal age to its monarchical age (4:18–22). The book's simple shape can thus be rendered:

- <span id="page-682-5"></span>II. Scene 1: Decisions on the Road Home (1:6–22)

- <span id="page-682-12"></span>VI. Plot Resolution: Restoration through a Redeemer in Bethlehem (4:13–17)
- VII. Epilogue: Compounding Provision (4:18–22)

<span id="page-682-13"></span><span id="page-682-10"></span><span id="page-682-7"></span><span id="page-682-4"></span><span id="page-682-1"></span>The drama focuses mainly on the plight of Naomi, to whom the narrator returns at the seams between scenes 1–3 (cf. 1:6, 22; 2:1, 22–23; 3:1, 18) and concerning whom the narrator applies the drama's chief significance (4:14–17). The composition is suffused with invocations of the Lord that highlight his power to bless (e.g., 1:8–9) and judge (e.g., 1:17), which demonstrates the narrator's decidedly covenantal worldview. Moreover, the narrator expertly develops the book's driving concern by employing various literary devices such as repeated words and themes (e.g., the "return" motif in Ruth 1), inclusios (e.g., the concept of rest in 3:1, 18), plot twists (e.g., the issue of the redeemer in 3:12), clear transitions delineating distinct scenes (e.g., 2:1), and a surprise ending (4:17b–22). The narrator mostly develops the book's characters through reported speech, though the manner in which the narrator identifies and describes characters is also instructive (e.g., by repeatedly referring to "Ruth the Moabite," the narrator highlights the extraordinary nature of this sojourner's covenant fidelity). These diverse literary strategies demonstrate the narrator's artistic skill.

#### <span id="page-682-14"></span>*Theology of Ruth; Its Relationship to the Rest of the Bible and to Christ*

<span id="page-682-17"></span><span id="page-682-16"></span><span id="page-682-2"></span><span id="page-682-0"></span>The Bible's metanarrative begins in the garden of Eden, comes to its climax in the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ, and culminates in the Lord's return, when he will bring his redemptive work to consummate effect and usher in the new heavens and the new earth. The narrator of Ruth transparently tethers the book to this broader biblical storyline (cf. 1:1; 4:17b–22), thereby leading the audience to interpret its drama as one scene in the Bible's metanarrative. Within the book of Ruth, several inner-biblical connections underscore the book's ties to the larger biblical story. Outside the book, the Bible mentions the person of Ruth only once (Matt. 1:5), in the genealogy of "Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" (Matt. 1:1). Ruth's inclusion in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus, Abraham's and David's greater son, is fitting since her inclusion among God's covenant people represents partial fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (Gen. 12:3) and the book of Ruth concludes by pointing to God's provision of David.

The following cluster of interrelated themes are particularly significant in discerning the book of Ruth's relationship to the rest of the Bible and to Christ.

#### GOD'S FAITHFULNESS TO FULFILL HIS COVENANTAL PROMISES

<span id="page-683-3"></span><span id="page-683-1"></span>The book highlights God's faithfulness to fulfill his promises to his people corporately and personally: to all "Israel" and to each covenant child.5 The book's poles evoke the corporate dimension of God's covenant work (1:1; 4:17b–22), while the central drama features the Lord's personal kindness to fill bereft Naomi. The narrator aims to encourage the Lord's covenant people, whose confidence in him is being tested, by showing how the Lord mercifully advances his salvation purposes amid their ordinary circumstances and afflictions. For example, in the era of the judges, when Israel has no human king, the Lord is at work to raise up his anointed servant, King David, so that "the scepter shall not depart from Judah" (Gen. 49:10; cf. 17:6). One of the Lord's main human instruments in fulfilling his covenant promise is a Moabite widow, Ruth, a "worthy woman" (3:11; cf. Prov. 31:10) who exemplifies covenant faithfulness. That a Moabite extends and receives covenant kindness signifies partial fulfillment of the Lord's promise to bless all the earth's families through Abraham's offspring (Gen. 12:1–3). The book's storyline illustrates God's faithfulness to deal kindly with his people beyond what they can discern in their finite, limited perspective, and it thereby calls his people to trust him, even and especially when dark circumstances seem to obscure his presence (cf. Gen. 50:20).

#### <span id="page-683-11"></span><span id="page-683-10"></span><span id="page-683-2"></span><span id="page-683-0"></span>THE COMPATIBILITY OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE AND HUMAN AGENCY

<span id="page-683-4"></span>The book of Ruth illustrates the compatibility of divine providence and human agency, thereby encouraging God's people to embrace a robust view of God's sovereignty without diminishing human responsibility, or vice versa. In a book highlighting the Lord's sovereign mercy toward those who take refuge under his wings, for example, only twice does the narrator point to the Lord's direct intervention (1:6; 4:13). That these references occur at the beginning and end of the plot suggests that all of the intervening drama unfolds at God's gracious direction and initiative. The narrator also more subtly points to the Lord's providential engagement in the narrative action, such as by noting that two widows arrive in Bethlehem "at the beginning of barley harvest" (1:22) and that Ruth "happens" to come to Boaz's field (2:3). In a variety of ways the narrator leads the audience to recognize the hand of God at work in his people's ordinary circumstances and decisions.

<span id="page-683-9"></span><span id="page-683-7"></span><span id="page-683-6"></span><span id="page-683-5"></span>Yet the narrator mostly portrays the Lord's kindness as it is mediated through human speech and action (e.g., Ruth's request in 3:9 that Boaz become the Lord's instrument of rewarding her, alluding to Boaz's blessing in 2:12). In particular, Ruth and Boaz function as the Lord's faithful agents to fill widowed Naomi in her emptiness. At various points Ruth and Boaz take bold, decisive, even risky action in

<span id="page-683-8"></span><sup>5</sup> References to "Israel" occur in Ruth 2:12; 4:7 (2x), 11, 14.

<span id="page-684-8"></span><span id="page-684-6"></span><span id="page-684-2"></span>a spirit of entrusting themselves to God's sovereign care and advancing someone else's welfare (e.g., 3:6–18). In fact, the narrator vividly contrasts extraordinary decisions of love (e.g., Boaz's costly redeeming act) with ordinary, pragmatic decisions of self-preservation (e.g., the kinsman-redeemer's refusal to redeem; 4:1–8; cf. 1:14). These human decisions unfold according to God's providence. By illustrating God's gracious rule, the story beckons the Lord's people to extend the same loyal love they have received from him to others, including in hard times when the Lord's purposes seem hidden.

#### THE POWER OF COVENANT KINDNESS

<span id="page-684-3"></span><span id="page-684-1"></span><span id="page-684-0"></span>A key concept in the book of Ruth is covenant kindness. The word translated "kindness" (or "loving kindness") occurs three times: twice on Naomi's lips (1:8; 2:20) and once on Boaz's (3:10). This word has a rich covenantal heritage and is often used to describe the peculiar love the Lord extends to his redeemed people (cf. Ex. 34:6–7). Such covenant kindness comes to its fullest expression in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus, for example, so identifies with God's people that he empties himself for their sake, even giving his life as a substitutionary sacrifice to pardon their sins and secure their everlasting life (Phil. 2:6–11; 2 Cor. 8:9).

<span id="page-684-12"></span><span id="page-684-7"></span><span id="page-684-5"></span>While the Bible features God's loving kindness toward his people, it also enjoins God's redeemed people to imitate him in extending kindness after his pattern. The book of Ruth in particular portrays the extraordinary impact of ordinary people's commitment to extend covenant kindness in ordinary life. For example, Ruth the Moabite's loyal love for her widowed mother-in-law (Ruth 3:10) expresses Ruth's deepest commitments, foreshadows her eventual inclusion in the covenant community, and plays a vital role in Naomi's ultimate restoration. Additionally, Boaz's kindness toward widowed Ruth and Naomi (cf. comment on 2:28–22) is crucial to resolving the book's central predicament. Significantly, the book's initial subject of loving kindness ("deal kindly with you"; 1:8) is the Lord, which helps cast Ruth and Boaz as the Lord's faithful agents. Humanly speaking, without Ruth's and Boaz's kindness Obed would never have been born, nor King David (4:17), nor David's greater son (Matt. 1:5).

#### <span id="page-684-11"></span><span id="page-684-10"></span>THE INSTITUTION OF REDEMPTION

The book of Ruth describes a concrete enactment of the redemption institution. Various forms of "redeem," "redeemer," and "redeeming" occur over twenty times in the Hebrew.6 Redemption is the main legal mechanism that precipitates the central conflict's resolution and formalizes Ruth's and Boaz's loving kindness to Naomi. In this book, the practice of redemption is bound up with kinship principles articulated in levirate-marriage legislation (cf. comment on 4:3–8).

<span id="page-684-9"></span>OT redemption laws aim to support socioeconomically vulnerable Israelites. A "redeemer" is a close male relative who, among other things, acts on behalf of a

<span id="page-684-4"></span><sup>6</sup> Cf. Ruth 2:20; 3:9, 12 (2x), 13 (4x); 4:1, 3, 4 (5x), 6 (4x), 7, 8, 14.

<span id="page-685-2"></span><span id="page-685-0"></span>family member in financial difficulty (cf. Lev. 25:23–55; Num. 27:11). More specifically, redemption legislation intends to eliminate permanent debt among Israelites, safeguard each family's inheritance allotment, and clarify kinship responsibilities among the covenant family. To redeem a relative, a redeemer must pay a price (Lev. 25:50–52). Biblical redemption legislation is suffused with motive clauses recalling the Lord's redemptive grace to bring his people out of Egypt and give them the land of Canaan (e.g., Lev. 25:38). The book of Ruth's concrete illustration of the institution points forward to God's ultimate redemption of his people through Jesus, who willingly ransoms believers "not with perishable things such as silver and gold, but with [his] precious blood" (1 Pet. 1:18–19; cf. Jude 5).

#### <span id="page-685-7"></span><span id="page-685-1"></span>*Preaching from Ruth*

Although some prefer expounding the whole book of Ruth in a single sermon, each chapter yields sufficient interpretive fruit for preaching the book in a four-sermon series. If handling the whole book in one sermon, one must avoid overemphasizing the genealogical epilogue's royal interests in a manner that overshadows the book's dominant concern to display God's loving kindness to ordinary Israelites facing hardships in this fallen world. If handling the book chapter by chapter, one must keep in view the book's driving concern and explain each chapter's peculiar contribution to it.

<span id="page-685-4"></span><span id="page-685-3"></span>Expositors of Ruth will be helped by discerning and employing the narrator's various literary strategies. The narrator's methods ought to influence the preacher's methods. For example, the narrator frames the plot by locating it in the broader biblical storyline (1:1; 4:17b–22), which points to the importance for expositors of illuminating the book's redemptive-historical setting. The preacher must note also how the narrator discloses the drama's relevance to ordinary human beings in this broken, sinful world. The setting (1:1–5), for example, depicts human misery and illustrates the rapid devastation of Naomi's life. Reflecting on the drama's situatedness in real time and space can help expositors avoid merely reducing the narratives to a principle or a main point, a common pitfall in preaching this genre. Biblical narrators do convey principles and themes, but they do so through vividly portraying the embodiment (or lack thereof) of these principles and themes in real human experience. These representative examples illustrate the homiletical fruitfulness of attending to narrative strategies in Ruth.

<span id="page-685-6"></span><span id="page-685-5"></span>The narrator's characterization of Naomi merits special attention, particularly with regard to three matters. First, the narrator deals with Naomi's predicament honestly, but not harshly. The narrator never demeans Naomi, even in candidly relaying her affliction (1:1–5) and petition to be called Bitter (1:20–21) and in constructing the storyline to refute her despairing interpretation of her suffering. Expositors must ask God to help them instruct with gentleness and compassion (cf. Isa. 42:1–4; Matt. 12:15–21) rather than (even inadvertently) disparaging or discouraging those among their audience with whom Naomi's trauma and/or despair resonate.

Second, in testifying to God's sovereign grace, the narrator nowhere minimizes Naomi's suffering or trivializes her grief. The narrator does not portray Obed's birth, for example, as somehow expunging any lingering heartache for Naomi related to losing her husband and two sons. Neither should expositors of Ruth handle human suffering in a simplistic, reductionistic manner as they explicate God's sovereign grace. Third, the narrator does not imply that God always resolves his people's predicaments during their days in this fallen world. Yes, the narrator testifies to God's faithfulness to his people corporately and personally, but not by espousing an overrealized eschatology. For example, simply because God grants Ruth conception and restores Naomi does not mean he will similarly restore all his suffering children this side of heaven or that he always reveals his specific purposes. Indeed, the concluding genealogy confirms that certain elements of Naomi's restoration unfold after her death. Likewise, believers will not know God's full purposes in and through their suffering until they see him face to face. In applying the book's resolution and epilogue, the relevant point is not "What God *does* for Naomi, he will do for you" in the here and now but rather "Who God *is* for Naomi, he will be for you."7

#### *Interpretive Challenges*

<span id="page-686-5"></span><span id="page-686-4"></span><span id="page-686-3"></span><span id="page-686-2"></span><span id="page-686-1"></span>Beyond the few instances in which the Hebrew text is difficult to translate and interpret (e.g., Ruth 2:7) or the precise referent is debated (cf. comments on 2:18–22; 4:3–8), the main areas of debate in Ruth tend to cluster around a few key questions. First, does Elimelech's decision in famine to leave Bethlehem with his family and relocate to Moab express unfaithfulness on his part, godly wisdom, or morally neutral pragmatism (1:1–2)? Second, does the narrator characterize Naomi in scene 3 as a manipulative, reckless schemer or as a shrewd woman taking godly initiative (3:1–4)? Third, to what extent ought one interpret Ruth's actions at the threshing floor as sexually provocative (3:6–9)? Fourth, does Ruth's marriage proposal to Boaz (3:9) indicate that the institutions of redemption and levirate marriage are somehow interrelated during this era of Israel's history? If so, does this interrelationship suggest that, at this time, the practice of levirate marriage applies not merely to a deceased man's brother (as in Deut. 25:5–10) but more broadly to the nearest kinsman? The commentary below addresses these matters in more detail.

<span id="page-688-0"></span>1In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. **2**The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. **3**But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. **4**These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years, **<sup>5</sup>** and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.

**<sup>6</sup>**Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the Lord had visited his people and given them food. **<sup>7</sup>** So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. **8**But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. **9**The Lord grant that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband!" Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. **10**And they said to her, "No, we will return with you to your people." **11**But Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? **12**Turn back, my daughters; go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons, **13**would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me." **14**Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.

**<sup>15</sup>**And she said, "See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law." **16**But Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. **17**Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you." **18**And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.

**<sup>19</sup>** So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-689-0"></span>Ruth 1 consists of the plot's setup (1:1–5) and first scene (vv. 6–22). Of the book's three main characters, the opening chapter features two: widowed Naomi and widowed Ruth, Naomi's Moabite daughter-in-law. The narrator weaves a migration motif through the chapter: Elimelech's family emigrates from Bethlehem, Naomi returns to Bethlehem, Orpah returns to her Moabite maternal home, and Ruth immigrates to Bethlehem with Naomi.

The introduction (vv. 1–5) tells of various tragedies afflicting Naomi over the course of about a decade. The narrator tersely reports one tragedy after another in rapid succession, which highlights the compounding intensity of Naomi's grief. She is being emptied of every man in her family and thus is bereft of all customary means of security, provision, or legacy.

<span id="page-689-3"></span><span id="page-689-2"></span><span id="page-689-1"></span>The main action begins as widowed Naomi hears a report in the fields of Moab that the Lord has visited his people by giving them bread (v. 6). She consequently decides to return to Judah. Scene 1 unfolds mainly through dialogue on the road among three widows: Naomi and her two daughters-in-law. The scene peaks when Ruth clings to Naomi (v. 14b) and verbalizes her unyielding loyalty to Naomi (vv. 16–17). Also critical is Naomi's speech to the women of Bethlehem regarding her grief-stricken sense that the Lord is against her (vv. 20–21). But although scene 1 candidly conveys three widows' distress, the scene concludes with a glimmer of hope: Naomi and Ruth arrive in Bethlehem as barley harvest begins (v. 22). This flickering light strengthens as the storyline unfolds so that, in its whole-book context, Ruth 1 sets the stage for the Lord to prove his loving kindness to Naomi.

#### *Comment*

1:1 In the first clause of 1:1 the narrator identifies the drama's broad temporal context: "in the days when the judges ruled." This period of Israel's history occurs between Joshua's death and Saul's coronation and is chronicled mostly in the book of Judges (cf. Introduction: Overview). Judges evocatively summarizes this era's spiritual and moral atmosphere: "In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judg. 21:25). Spiritual and moral anarchy seemed to prevail.

<span id="page-690-7"></span><span id="page-690-6"></span><span id="page-690-5"></span><span id="page-690-4"></span>The second clause of Ruth 1:1 reports the specific occasion precipitating the events reported in the setting: a famine. Famine in the Promised Land does not bode well. It not only creates an obvious crisis but also is possibly connected to divine judgment. Through Moses the Lord promised to reward Israel's covenant faithfulness with blessing (including the land's fruitfulness; Deut. 28:1–4) and to judge covenant unfaithfulness with curse (including famine; Deut. 28:15–68; cf. Gen. 3:17–19). While the narrator does not explain the origin of this particular famine, a famine in Judah at this point in redemptive history may imply some kind of unfaithfulness among the people, though not necessarily among Elimelech's family in particular.

<span id="page-690-3"></span><span id="page-690-1"></span><span id="page-690-0"></span>The focus then narrows to a "man of Bethlehem in Judah" who leaves faminestruck Bethlehem with his wife and two sons to "sojourn in the country of Moab," east of the Dead Sea. Although the Moabites and the Israelites both descended from Terah (Gen. 19:36–37), interactions between the two people groups were often hostile (Num. 22:1–24:25; 25:1; Deut. 23:3–6; Judg. 3:12–30). The narrator offers no explicit evaluation of Elimelech's decision to leave Bethlehem, so readers must draw their own conclusions. The fact that the famine ironically strikes "Bethlehem" ("house of bread") intensifies the tone of tragic deviation from idealized covenant life in the land. Moreover, an Israelite's choosing to leave Canaan to sojourn in Moab likewise casts a foreboding shadow.

<span id="page-690-9"></span><span id="page-690-8"></span>1:2–5 The narrator continues setting up the plot by identifying the Judahite family and reporting its settling in Moab (Ruth 1:2). The narrator gives the family's personal names and clan: they are "Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah." Notably, this is also the clan, hometown, and ancestral territory of King David, the significance of which the book's conclusion clarifies (4:17–22; cf. Gen. 49:10; 1 Sam. 17:12).

<span id="page-690-10"></span><span id="page-690-2"></span>After the family begins residing in Moab, Elimelech dies. The death of the "husband of Naomi" creates a crisis for Naomi, since she is "left" with just her two sons. (Calling Elimelech Naomi's husband underscores her loss.) Eventually life goes on: Naomi's two sons marry Moabite women, and they "lived there" for about a decade. The family's situatedness in Moab subtly evolves from "sojourn" (Ruth 1:1) to "remained there" (v. 2) to "about ten years" (v. 4).

<span id="page-691-10"></span><span id="page-691-2"></span><span id="page-691-1"></span>Here again the narrator does not evaluate these residential or marital decisions explicitly, which forces readers to draw their own conclusions. The law never forbids marriage to Moabites specifically (as it does Canaanites; e.g., Deut. 7:1–3) but does prohibit Moabites from entering the assembly to the tenth generation (Deut. 23:3). Marrying a member of a noncovenant group threatens one's fidelity to the Lord (e.g., 1 Kings 11:4; Ezra 10:3; Nehemiah 13; Ps. 106:35–36). Are Naomi's sons acting unfaithfully by marrying Moabite women? Should Naomi have guided her sons differently? Is the family acting unfaithfully by remaining in Moab? Despite the ambiguity concerning these matters, the plot unambiguously confirms the Lord's providence through it all.

<span id="page-691-8"></span>Eventually, both Naomi's "sons" (or "children") also die, so that "the woman" is "left" without any remaining men in her family. Calling Naomi "the woman" stresses her vulnerability as a sojourner without husband or sons in a society in which legal and economic security depends on a male family member, while calling her sons "children" stresses her maternal agony (cf. comment on 4:13–17). On the whole, the setting depicts a traumatized woman in cataclysmic crisis. She has been devastated by overwhelming loss and now lacks access to socioeconomic support. What will become of her?

<span id="page-691-9"></span><span id="page-691-0"></span>1:6–7 The plot's main action begins when Naomi decides to rise with her daughters-in-law and return home in response to a report in Moab's fields that the Lord has "visited his people." Divine visitations of his covenant people can refer to the Lord's judgment (e.g., Ex. 34:7) or grace (e.g., Gen. 21:1; 50:24–25; Ex. 4:31; 1 Sam. 2:21). In this case the Lord has graciously sent his people harvest-yielding rain, thereby he has "given them food" (or "given them bread," a likely wordplay with "Bethlehem" ["house of bread"]). The Lord's benevolence thereby initiates the plot's action, as it also will the plot's resolution (cf. comment on 4:13–17).

<span id="page-691-7"></span><span id="page-691-6"></span><span id="page-691-5"></span>The concept of returning lies at the heart of scene 1, which incorporates twelve forms of "return" (Ruth 1:6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 [2x], 16, 21, 22 [2x]). Double uses of "return" (Hb. *shuv*) occur at the scene's introduction and conclusion (vv. 6–7, 21). The first two instances of "return" specify the origin (i.e., Moab) and intended destination (i.e., Judah) of Naomi's journey. Scene 1's return motif evokes a rich biblical-theological theme involving the Lord and his people's turning toward one another. Deuteronomy 30:1–10, for example, features the Hebrew word for "return" to prophesy of the Lord's merciful turning to his people, which leads to their returning to Canaan from exile and turning to him in repentance (Deut. 30:1, 2 [2x], 3 [2x], 8, 9, 10).8 Although the narrator of Ruth seems to draw on this broader biblical-theological pattern, this does not demand interpreting Naomi's return to Bethlehem as repentance from sin. At the least, the thematic emphasis on Naomi's returning in response to a benevolent divine visitation

<span id="page-691-12"></span><span id="page-691-11"></span><span id="page-691-4"></span><span id="page-691-3"></span><sup>8</sup> The emphasis in Deuteronomy 30 on the heart corresponds with OT texts that deal with the Lord's eschatological grace (e.g., Jer. 31:33; Ezek. 36:26). Note how Nehemiah appeals to this Deuteronomic prophecy in his prayer in Susa (Neh. 1:8–9). For a discussion of the relationship in Deuteronomy 30 between the Lord's and his people's turning cf. J. G. McConville, *Deuteronomy*,ApOTC 5 (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2002), 423–433.

raises expectations among a biblically informed audience that a happy reversal awaits Naomi in Judah.

<span id="page-692-6"></span><span id="page-692-4"></span><span id="page-692-2"></span>1:8–9 Having established Naomi's afflictions (Ruth 1:1–5) and her resolve to return (vv. 6–7), the narrator slows the narrative tempo and develops the characters. Scene 1 unfolds mostly through dialogue that intensifies the pathos. For example, Naomi's opening speech to her daughters-in-law (vv. 8–9a) and their response (v. 9b) divulge their profound mutual love.

<span id="page-692-8"></span><span id="page-692-0"></span>Naomi wants her daughters-in-law to remarry and bear children, not least since marriage and childbearing typically afford a woman security. In Naomi's estimation, Moabite Orpah and Ruth would face grim prospects of remarriage and childbearing in Judah. So Naomi instructs each to "return" to the house of her mother, who presumably will ensure that each remarries (cf. Gen. 24:28). Naomi then blesses them.9 Specifically, she petitions the Lord to "deal kindly" them, just as they have done for her and for "the dead" (i.e., Naomi's sons), and to give them "rest" through remarriage.10 At least in part, Naomi is entrusting Orpah and Ruth to the Lord's care (cf. comment on 1:14b–18). She acknowledges the Lord's ability to bless, even as she soon will articulate skepticism about his willingness to bless her personally and therefore any whose lot is tied to hers, including her daughters-in-law.

<span id="page-692-14"></span><span id="page-692-12"></span><span id="page-692-5"></span>Naomi's blessing introduces two important themes in the book: kindness and rest. The phrase "deal kindly" might be translated more woodenly "do/perform loving kindness." The word for covenant "kindness" (Hb. *hesed*), which occurs three times in the book (1:8; 2:20; 3:10), is often used in the OT to describe the Lord's loving kindness toward his redeemed people (cf. Introduction: Theology of Ruth). The "rest" (cf. 3:1) Naomi envisions pertains specifically to the security a new marriage and home would provide. But in a drama that transpires "in the days when the judges ruled" (1:1) and culminates in David's genealogy, "rest" hints at greater significance (cf. comment on 4:17–22). That is, the widows need the security a husband provides, and the whole covenant family needs the security a king provides. The explicit yearning for "rest," then, subtly paves the way for the book's culminating focus on the Davidic dynasty.11

<span id="page-692-16"></span><span id="page-692-1"></span>In the moments on the road, however, such "rest" seems elusive for the widows. Naomi kisses her daughters-in-law and bids them farewell. They "lifted up their voices and wept."

<span id="page-692-10"></span><span id="page-692-9"></span>1:10–14a "No, we will return *with you* to your people," Orpah and Ruth protest. So Naomi intensifies her original instruction to her daughters-in-law. She twice commands Orpah and Ruth, whom she tenderly calls "my daughters" (vv. 11, 12, 13; cf. 2:2, 8, 22; 3:1, 10, 11, 16, 18), to "turn back" (that is, *return*) and poses a series

<span id="page-692-11"></span><span id="page-692-7"></span><sup>9</sup> The book mostly underscores the Lord's sovereign presence through the blessings, prayers, and vows of God's people (1:8–9, 17; 2:4, 12, 20; 3:10, 13; 4:11–12, 14). Only twice does the narrator explicitly describe the Lord's direct intervention (1:6; 4:13).

<span id="page-692-15"></span><span id="page-692-13"></span><span id="page-692-3"></span><sup>10</sup> For the latter cf. comment on 3:1–5. For the former note how the concept of divine reward for showing steadfast love appears also in Ruth 2:12.

<span id="page-692-17"></span><sup>11</sup> Cf. the use of "rest" in 2 Samuel 7:1, 10–11.

of rhetorical questions to stress the grim prospects of their security in Judah. For example, Naomi draws attention to her barren-like womb and explains that even if she were to conceive more sons and arrange a marriage between them and her daughters-in-law, the amount of time required for a new son to reach maturity renders such a plan no real solution at all. Naomi is possibly alluding to levirate legislation (Deut. 25:5–6), which aims to support widows by requiring a dead husband's brother to marry his widow. Naomi is straining to persuade her daughtersin-law to make a sensible choice that has the potential to yield a positive outcome.

<span id="page-693-13"></span><span id="page-693-9"></span><span id="page-693-5"></span><span id="page-693-3"></span><span id="page-693-1"></span>To clinch Naomi's argument, she declares that the Lord is against her, that his "hand . . . has gone out against me."12 A ruler's "hand" often connotes his strength and authority (e.g., Ex. 7:5; Deut. 5:15; Judg. 7:9). Sometimes it is the Lord's own rebellious people against whom he stretches out his arm (e.g., Jer. 21:5) or sends his hand (e.g., Deut. 2:15; Judg. 2:15; 1 Sam. 12:15). Along these lines, Naomi interprets her suffering as resulting from the Lord's wrath against her (cf. Ruth 1:20–21). She suspects herself to be a target of divine censure and thereby unfit to provide for her daughters-in-law. After Naomi's urgent appeal, the women once again weep (v. 14a; cf. v. 9). Their anguish sets the stage for the scene's dramatic turning point.

<span id="page-693-8"></span><span id="page-693-7"></span><span id="page-693-6"></span>1:14b–18 The daughters-in-laws' critical moment of decision is now related. The narrator summarizes their response (v. 14b) and then elaborates (vv. 15–18). Orpah bids Naomi farewell with a kiss (cf. v. 9), but Ruth clings to her. Orpah's expected decision highlights the astonishing nature of Ruth's selfless decision (cf. the similar narrative strategy in 4:1–8).13

<span id="page-693-14"></span><span id="page-693-11"></span><span id="page-693-4"></span><span id="page-693-0"></span>Ruth decides to "cling" to Naomi despite the grim prospects awaiting her in Judah. Such clinging typifies the unyielding devotion of covenant relationships, such as in the marriage union (Gen. 2:24) or in Israel's relationship with the Lord (Deut. 10:20). By clinging to widowed Naomi in loyal love, Ruth embodies the essence of God's law (cf. Rom. 13:8–10). Indeed, Boaz calls Ruth's devotion to Naomi "kindness" (or "loving kindness"; Ruth 3:10; cf. 2:11), and the Bethlehemite women call it "love" (4:15). Ruth may merely be Naomi's daughter-in-law (and a Moabite!), but Ruth's kinship to Naomi is thicker than blood.

<span id="page-693-12"></span><span id="page-693-10"></span>Following a terse summary of the turning-point action (v. 14b), the narrator elaborates on Ruth's devotion to Naomi. Naomi appeals once more to Ruth and urges her to follow after her sister-in-law, Orpah, who has "gone back [i.e., *returned*] to her people and to her gods." Ruth, therefore, should "return after" Orpah (v. 15). Naomi's final appeal reveals the religious implication of Ruth's decision. Ruth's returning to her native household would entail returning to her native gods, including Moab's main territorial deity, Chemosh (cf. Num. 21:29; Judg. 11:24).

<span id="page-693-2"></span><sup>12</sup> Commentators interpret Naomi's meaning in a variety of ways. Some argue that Naomi's declaration expresses her willingness to communicate openly with the Lord, that is, a "faith and confidence in Yahweh which shines brightly against the dark and questioning backdrop of the days when the judges ruled." David Atkinson, *The Message of Ruth: The Wings of Refuge*, BST (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 1983), 54. More likely, however, is the view that, in her profound anguish of soul, Naomi casts the Lord as her enemy (e.g., Hubbard, *Book of Ruth*, 112–113).

<sup>13</sup> Cf. Daniel I. Block, *Ruth: A Discourse Analysis of the Hebrew Bible*, ZECOT (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2015), 91.

<span id="page-694-3"></span>Ruth again rejects Naomi's appeal with the sort of urgency and selfless love that match her mother-in-law's (Ruth 1:16–17). Ruth reasserts her uncompromising devotion and insists that Naomi must stop asking Ruth to forsake her. Wherever Naomi decides to settle, Ruth will settle. Naomi's people and God will be Ruth's people and God. Indeed, Ruth's loyalty extends beyond this lifetime, since, wherever Naomi dies, Ruth will die and be buried. The fact that Ruth's emphatic declaration culminates in images of death rather than of prosperity may indicate Ruth's acquiescence to Naomi's grim outlook about a widowed sojourner's life in Judah.14 Ruth's final words crown her earnest resolve: she invokes a self-imprecatory oath, petitioning the Lord (not Chemosh!) to afflict her were she ever to forsake Naomi (cf. 1 Sam. 20:13).15 Ruth's relentless resolve convinces Naomi to say no more.

<span id="page-694-8"></span><span id="page-694-4"></span>1:19–21 The two widows resume the journey and eventually arrive in Bethlehem. Naomi's homecoming causes quite a commotion, most likely because she returns with Ruth and without her husband or sons. Naomi's bereft condition provokes the Bethlehemite women to ask, perhaps in appalling shock, "Is *this* Naomi?"

<span id="page-694-6"></span><span id="page-694-5"></span><span id="page-694-0"></span>Naomi responds to the astonishment in a manner that reveals the gravity of her grief (Ruth 1:20–21). She objects to being called "Naomi" ("Pleasant"; cf. ESV mg.) and instead exhorts them to call her "Mara" ("Bitter"; cf. ESV Mg.). In her view the Lord, to whom she refers twice as "the Almighty" (or "Shaddai"; cf. Gen. 17:1; Ex. 6:3; Ps. 91:1; Job 27:2), has so embittered her (cf. Ruth 1:13) that she has become bitterness personified. Although she left Bethlehem "full," the Lord has returned her "empty." Even her complaint's structure in verse 21 conveys that she feels rejected by the Lord: in Hebrew she begins with "I" and concludes with "the Lord," putting the two at opposite poles.16 Calling her "Pleasant" would be cruelly ironic, since in her view the Lord has "testified against" (or "answered against") her and the Almighty has brought evil on her. Naomi's declared desolation and the fact that she invokes the Lord's name only indirectly (i.e., in dialogue with other people; vv. 8–9, 13, 20–21) intimate that her physical return to Judah may not signify that she is turning to the Lord in her heart.

<span id="page-694-2"></span>Naomi's complaint raises important questions regarding the nature and causes of suffering, especially among God's covenant people. In this sense, the book of Ruth shares common themes with the book of Job. Both books portray characters

14 Cf. ibid.

<sup>15</sup> Cf. note 9. Donna Petter convincingly argues, "In short, Ruth pledges to become an Israelite. . . . The fact that Ruth willfully becomes an Israelite and embraces the Lord by moving to Judah is somewhat typical of one in the ancient world adopting the god of the land to which they have moved. Her actions are atypical, however, when viewed against the average Israelite who, at that time, tended toward adopting foreign gods alongside the Lord. . . . Ruth the Moabitess is a model Israelite in that she embraces Yahweh fully and exclusively. But she is also a model Israelite in showing kindness according to Mosaic law." Donna Petter, "Ruth," in *The Baker Illustrated Bible Commentary*, ed. Gary Burge and Andrew Hill (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2012), e-book, ch. 2, section C, "Ruth's Resolve and Confession (1:16–17)."

<span id="page-694-7"></span><span id="page-694-1"></span>Rahab the Canaanite prostitute also pledges covenant loyalty to Israel's God and people and thereby becomes a legitimate Israelite (Josh. 2:9–13; cf. Josh. 6:25). Significantly, Rahab eventually marries Salmon and gives birth to Boaz (Ruth 4:21; cf. Matt. 1:5–6). 16 Block, *Ruth*, 103.

<span id="page-695-10"></span><span id="page-695-2"></span><span id="page-695-0"></span>grappling with bitter loss (cf. Job 27:2), and both storylines challenge a simplistic, mechanistic view of that loss. The narrator of Ruth nowhere specifies the direct source(s) of Naomi's bereavements or whether they result from the Lord's testimony against her, as Naomi supposes. It is possible that some of Naomi's affliction relates to the Lord's discipline for sin (cf. Deut. 8:1–10), perhaps even regarding decisions reported in the drama's setting (Ruth 1:1–5). But even if the Lord has afflicted her in response to specific sin on her or her family's part, the Lord disciplines only believers for their ultimate good (e.g., Deut. 8:1–10). His is restorative discipline. Moreover, he promises to grant mercy to those who turn to him from their heart (e.g., Deut. 30:1–10).

<span id="page-695-1"></span>Naomi seems to have lost sight of these aspects of the covenant relationship, that the Lord disciplines his people only for their ultimate good and is eager to restore repentant believers.17 It is equally possible, however, that Naomi's losses do not represent divine disfavor relating to her or her family's sin but rather result more generally from living in a broken, fallen world. Such loss in this case still falls within the scope of the Lord's sovereignty. Throughout the Scriptures the Lord promises to show steadfast love to suffering believers, including those who feel forgotten and abandoned in this fallen world (e.g., Psalm 13). He summons his people to turn to him in their affliction. However, rather than lifting her eyes to the Lord and petitioning him to deal kindly with her, Naomi declares herself a target of his wrath and defines herself according to what she lacks.

<span id="page-695-11"></span><span id="page-695-9"></span><span id="page-695-7"></span><span id="page-695-5"></span>1:22 Against the backdrop of Naomi's expressing misery flickers a subtle gleam of hope. In fact, the narrator crafts scene 1 (Ruth 1:6–22) in a manner that gently corrects Naomi's supposition of her God-forsakenness. The scene's structure highlights what Naomi has rather than what she lacks: the drama begins with divine benevolence (v. 6), peaks in Ruth's unyielding loyalty to Naomi (vv. 14b–17), and concludes by emphasizing two visible proofs of the Lord's grace (v. 22). Specifically, the narrator reports that Naomi returns successfully *with Ruth* (i.e., Naomi is not utterly "empty"; 1:21; cf. 4:15) and *during harvest season*. The latter confirms the good news that Naomi heard in the fields of Moab (1:6) and provides a smooth transition to scene 2.

<span id="page-695-8"></span><span id="page-695-3"></span>The tangible evidence of the Lord's benevolence, which ought to have refreshed Naomi's sense of his mercy, appears not to have alleviated her misery. Naomi's despondency so dominates her field of vision that she cannot appreciate these signs of the Lord's loving kindness. She seems to have returned home devoid of hope for meaningful personal restoration. But as the unfolding drama will establish, this scene's raw portrait of Naomi's despair sets the stage for the Lord's merciful renewal of his beloved daughter.

<span id="page-695-6"></span><span id="page-695-4"></span><sup>17</sup> Naomi rightly recognizes the Lord's sovereign power. She trusts the report of the Lord's gracious visitation of his people (Ruth 1:6). She considers the Lord capable of blessing her daughters-in-law with "rest" (1:8–9). She believes the Lord is capable of stretching out his hand against her to afflict her (1:13, 20–21). But although she believes the Lord is capable of doing good to others, she does not trust that he is inclined to do good to her.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-696-1"></span>Ruth 1 features Naomi, an old covenant saint who has endured at least a decade of compounding affliction. The narrator thus provides a sober portrait of life east of Eden, this fallen world in which human beings face various crises, such as famine, fear, death, injustice, and depression. In the throes of traumatic suffering, sometimes we believers interpret our affliction as evidence of divine disfavor, as does Naomi. But believers in every age must wage war on such suffering-induced skepticism and, rather than letting our circumstances interpret God, let God's Word interpret our circumstances. It is true that God sometimes leads his children into suffering (cf. 1 Pet. 1:6–7; 2:18–25; James 1:2–4) and sometimes afflicts us in loving discipline (e.g., Deut. 8:5; Heb. 12:3–11). But believers must never interpret our suffering as God's testimony against us, except when we are indulging in unrepentant sin—and even then, God opposes our sin because he loves us.

<span id="page-696-9"></span><span id="page-696-2"></span><span id="page-696-0"></span>Along these lines, the narrator's "return" motif conveys three principles of covenant life east of Eden. First, when hardship comes, God's people are often tempted to leave home, the context of God's special covenant grace (Ruth 1:1–5). When famine strikes Bethlehem, Elimelech seeks respite for his family outside the Promised Land. He does not seem to prioritize the privilege of living in close proximity to the Lord's presence among his covenant people. Likewise, sometimes Christians seek satisfaction outside of Christ and his regular means of grace. We sometimes forfeit regular, intimate fellowship with God and his covenant people, perhaps by not attending corporate worship or communing with God in his Word or prayer. Taking for granted our special privileges in Christ eventually leads us to wander from him. Sometimes our wandering is visible, while other times our external religious performance momentarily conceals our heart's distance from God (cf. Isa. 29:13).

<span id="page-696-6"></span><span id="page-696-3"></span>Second, whenever we believers do leave home, we must return (Ruth 1:6–21). God the Father always provides a way home for his wandering children. Returning to the Lord for Naomi entails a physical pilgrimage to Judah. She returns to the special place in which the Lord promised to invest his name among his people. For new covenant believers, returning to God means turning to him in faith and repentance: confessing and turning from our sin, receiving his pardon, and recommitting ourselves to rely on his grace and walk in his way. Repentant believers embrace again God's special means of grace for his children, including his Word, prayer, the sacraments, and local church fellowship. Moreover, God has tenderly crafted a form of prayer specifically for his suffering children: lament.18 Along these lines, one hopes that, after the Bethlehemite women listened to Naomi's agony, wept with her, and assured her of their love and ongoing support, they also gently encouraged her to take her complaint directly to the Lord, who inclines his ear to his suffering children and comforts us.

<span id="page-696-8"></span><span id="page-696-7"></span><span id="page-696-5"></span><span id="page-696-4"></span><sup>18</sup> E.g., in Hannah's affliction she flees not *from* the Lord but *to* him as she pours out her soul (1 Samuel 1). Cf. Psalm 13 for another classic example of lament. More profoundly, the Lord Jesus Christ pours out his heart to his Father in Gethsemane (Matt. 26:36–46) and cries out in God-forsakenness at Calvary (Matt. 27:46), all the while entrusting himself into his Father's loving hands (Luke 23:46; 1 Pet. 2:23).

<span id="page-697-2"></span><span id="page-697-0"></span>Third, when believers return home, God meets us with blessing (1:22), no matter how far we have wandered or how feeble our faith (cf. Luke 15:11–32). Naomi does not wait to get her act (or theology) together. She does not try to curry God's favor by presenting some kind of penance. She comes home just as she is, in all her weakness and despair. Despite her deep-seated, publicly avowed skepticism about the Lord's posture toward her, he welcomes his embittered child with blessing, as this scene's final words suggest and scenes 2–4 substantiate. Herein lies a critical point: the Lord's fundamental posture toward Naomi hinges not on the perfection of her turning but on the perfection of the One to whom she turns. It is not the quality of Naomi's faith that determines her position as God's beloved daughter but the object of her faith. Not even suffering-induced skepticism can separate her from God's love through the Lord Jesus Christ. For believers of every age, Jesus bore our sin that we might become the righteousness of God and thereby receive his everlasting welcome (2 Cor. 5:21). So we must turn to God in our affliction, looking to him to supply what we lack. He fills our empty hands by grace. One day soon our Father will bring us to our everlasting home, that final resting place in which faith will be sight and the tangible evidence of his grace in Christ will wholly persuade us of his enduring favor. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!

### <span id="page-697-3"></span><span id="page-697-1"></span>RUTH 2:1–23

2 Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. **2**And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter." **<sup>3</sup>** So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech. **4**And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem. And he said to the reapers, "The Lord be with you!" And they answered, "The Lord bless you." **5**Then Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?" **6**And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, "She is the young Moabite woman, who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. **<sup>7</sup>** She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.' So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, except for a short rest."*<sup>1</sup>*

**<sup>8</sup>**Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women. **9**Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn." **10**Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, "Why have

I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?" **11**But Boaz answered her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. **12**The Lord repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!" **13**Then she said, "I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not one of your servants."

**<sup>14</sup>**And at mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine." So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain. And she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over. **15**When she rose to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. **16**And also pull out some from the bundles for her and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her."

**<sup>17</sup>** So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah*<sup>2</sup>* of barley. **18**And she took it up and went into the city. Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied. **19**And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, "The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz." **20**And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed by the Lord, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!" Naomi also said to her, "The man is a close relative of ours, one of our redeemers." **21**And Ruth the Moabite said, "Besides, he said to me, 'You shall keep close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.' " **22**And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughterin-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, lest in another field you be assaulted." **<sup>23</sup>** So she kept close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-698-0"></span>Ruth 2 (i.e., scene 2) focuses on the Lord's loving kindness toward those who take refuge under his wings. The narrator begins unfolding the Lord's sovereign purposes to fill bereft Naomi (cf. 1:20–21), starting with her need for daily bread. The Lord accomplishes his purpose through his faithful servants Ruth and Boaz, the key instruments of his loving kindness. Scene 2 recounts Ruth and Boaz's first encounter and the honorable, grace-filled nature of their premarital interactions.

<span id="page-698-1"></span>Although the scene begins and ends in Naomi's home, it centers around Ruth and Boaz's interactions in Boaz's field. The narrator therefore starts by introducing Boaz, a relative of Elimelech, Naomi's deceased husband (2:1). The action then opens with "Ruth the Moabite" asking her mother-in-law for permission to go out and glean, the success of which entails finding favor in an authorized <span id="page-699-12"></span><span id="page-699-7"></span><span id="page-699-3"></span>man's eyes (v. 2). Ruth's diligent initiative "happens" to lead her to Boaz's field (v. 3), where she finds extraordinary favor in his eyes (vv. 4–17). Ruth returns to Naomi's home with a surprising amount of food and a report of Boaz's kindness, which provokes Naomi to blessing and budding hope (vv. 18–22). The narrator's concluding commentary regarding Ruth's ongoing gleaning and living with her mother-in-law highlights the steady commitment of Boaz to the widows and of Ruth to Naomi (v. 23).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-699-4"></span>2:1 Because scene 2 features dialogue between Boaz and Ruth, the narrator begins by introducing Boaz. Boaz is: (1) a "relative" of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech; (2) a "worthy man";19 and (3) of Elimelech's clan. These three observations raise a sense of expectancy, as the first and third imply that Boaz may have a family obligation to care for Naomi (cf. comment on 2:18–22) and the second implies that he has the ability and/or character to do so.

<span id="page-699-11"></span><span id="page-699-8"></span><span id="page-699-6"></span><span id="page-699-5"></span><span id="page-699-2"></span>2:2–3 "Ruth the Moabite" (cf. comment on 1:2–5) takes initiative to procure food for herself and her mother-in-law. Ruth's bold action (cf. 2:2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 23) is all the more remarkable because of her socioeconomic vulnerability in terms of her ethnicity (cf. vv. 2, 6 [2x], 10, 11), gender (v. 9), and social rank (v. 13). Her request to glean among the grain of one "in whose sight I shall find favor" presupposes the real possibility of being rejected, not least in an era of Israel's history characterized by spiritual and moral anarchy (cf. 1:1).20 Despite the risks, Ruth voluntarily sets out to provide for Naomi, exhibiting her courageous love.

<span id="page-699-10"></span><span id="page-699-9"></span><span id="page-699-1"></span>Various forms of the word "glean" occur twelve times in scene 2 (2:2, 3, 7, 8, 15 [2x], 16, 17 [2x], 18, 19, 23). Gleaning involves gathering leftover grain after

<sup>19</sup> The Hebrew could be translated more woodenly as a "man, mighty of worth/strength/wealth/skill." As is evident, the final word can be understood variously. Perhaps the narrator leaves the matter ambiguous to create suspense. The unfolding plot clarifies that Boaz abounds in material wealth (cf. "man of wealth"; 1 Sam. 9:1), skill (cf. "very able"; 1 Kings 11:28), and moral character (cf. "an excellent wife"; Prov. 31:10; cf. comment on Ruth 3:10–13).

<span id="page-699-14"></span><span id="page-699-13"></span><span id="page-699-0"></span><sup>20</sup> The expression "to find favor/grace in someone's sight" often refers to a subject's being accepted or honored by a superior. It occurs three times in Ruth (2:2, 10, 13) and over thirty times in the OT as a whole (e.g., Gen. 6:8; 18:3; 39:4; Ex. 33:12–13; 1 Sam. 16:22; Est. 8:5; Prov. 3:4).

<span id="page-700-1"></span>a harvest. The OT gleaning laws are among those that convey the Lord's intention for his covenant people to extend loving kindness to vulnerable persons in Canaan. Deuteronomy 24:19–22, for example, prohibits farmers from returning to their fields after harvesting to collect residual crops, instructing them instead to allow the leftovers to be gathered by people without legal access to the land: the resident alien, fatherless, and widow (cf. Lev. 19:9–10; 23:22; comments on 2:14–17).

<span id="page-700-14"></span><span id="page-700-2"></span><span id="page-700-0"></span>After Naomi's gentle encouragement, "Go, my daughter" (cf. 1:11, 12, 13), Ruth takes decisive action to discover a field in which to glean. As it turns out, "she *happened* to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech." Such commentary subtly points to the Lord's providential hand at work. Indeed, we might picture a certain twinkle in the narrator's eye in writing these words, knowing that the attentive reader/listener will soon interpret Ruth's arrival to Boaz's field as evidence of the Lord's sovereign grace, not mere circumstance.

<span id="page-700-8"></span><span id="page-700-6"></span><span id="page-700-4"></span>2:4–7 Having been introduced as a "worthy man" (2:1) and Elimelech's relative (vv. 1, 3), Boaz charges the plot with renewed energy when he arrives. As is common in Hebrew narrative, the narrator largely uses reported speech to develop Boaz's character. Boaz greets his field hands by invoking the Lord's presence among them, to which they respond by petitioning the Lord to bless him (v. 4).21 This exchange portrays Boaz's godly leadership in cultivating a gracious work environment, especially by seeking the Lord's blessed presence among his supervisees.

<span id="page-700-9"></span><span id="page-700-7"></span>Boaz continues modeling effective leadership by attending to the field's details with his foreman (vv. 5–7). For example, Boaz recognizes a stranger's presence and asks the foreman about her: "Whose young woman is this?" (Boaz's question subtly evokes Ruth's vulnerability: this sojourning woman is not under *any* empowered Bethlehemite's care.) The foreman's initial response suggests that Ruth's dedication to Naomi is already well known (v. 6; cf. v. 11), which means Ruth's socioeconomic condition would also be known. While debate surrounds the particulars of verse 7,22 the foreman's report gives Boaz enough information for him to take decisive action.

<span id="page-700-13"></span><span id="page-700-11"></span><span id="page-700-10"></span><span id="page-700-5"></span>2:8–13 Boaz refers to Ruth as "my daughter" (cf. 2:2), which expresses their age difference and his fatherly care. His concern for Ruth, an immigrant, exemplifies how this book challenges simplistic ethnocentrism with respect to notions of covenant identity and kinship. Boaz instructs Ruth not to glean in another field nor to leave his field but rather to "keep close"23 to the young women gleaning in his field (v. 8) and to keep her sights on his field (v. 9). Boaz then surpasses Ruth's

<span id="page-700-12"></span><sup>21</sup> Cf. note 9.

<sup>22</sup> E.g., is the foreman reporting that Ruth is persisting in standing and waiting for the field's owner to grant permission for her to glean, or that she is persisting to glean in the field? Cf. Jeremy Schipper, *Ruth: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary*, AYB 7D (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2016), 119–121. Schipper writes, "The last four words [in the Hebrew] of v. 7 represent the most difficult syntax and grammar in the book" (120).

<span id="page-700-3"></span><sup>23</sup> This is the same word used when Ruth "clung" to Naomi in 1:14 (cf. 2:21, 23).

<span id="page-701-10"></span>request (reported in v. 7) by ensuring her physical safety in his field and inviting her to quench her thirst with what his young men have drawn (v. 9).

<span id="page-701-12"></span><span id="page-701-8"></span>Ruth responds to Boaz's provision and protection with awestruck humility (v. 10). She falls on her face before him and expresses amazement that she has "found favor in [his] eyes" such that he "takes notice" of her (cf. 2:2). After all, she is a "foreigner," whose social standing is so lowly that she is not even one of his "servants."24 Yet despite this non-Israelite's social rank, farmer Boaz publicly honors immigrant Ruth in his field. He has "comforted" her and "spoken kindly" (or woodenly rendered, "upon the heart"; cf. Isa. 40:2) to her.

<span id="page-701-15"></span><span id="page-701-13"></span><span id="page-701-1"></span>Boaz counters Ruth's amazement concerning his kindness with his amazement concerning hers (v. 11). He has heard of Ruth's faithfulness to Naomi in leaving her native home and family to journey to a strange land. Consequently, he dignifies Ruth by blessing her and verbalizing his desire that she be rewarded by "the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge" (cf. Ex. 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Ps. 91:4). Boaz acknowledges the Lord's sovereign presence (cf. Ruth 2:4) by exalting him as Ruth's ultimate benefactor. Boaz articulates the message of God's grace as he welcomes Ruth as a covenant insider.25

<span id="page-701-9"></span><span id="page-701-7"></span>In sum Ruth discovers the kindness she seeks in the field of Boaz, in whose sight she finds favor. Boaz stewards his resources, including his power and influence, for Ruth's good. Specifically, he takes notice of Ruth, publicly commends her character, provides for her needs (and, through her, for Naomi's), protects her, and implores the Lord to reward her as one under the Lord's tender care.

<span id="page-701-14"></span><span id="page-701-11"></span><span id="page-701-6"></span>2:14–16 Boaz most vividly bestows favor on Ruth at mealtime. He goes beyond the law's letter (e.g., Deut. 24:19–22; cf. comment on Ruth 2:2–3) to fulfill its spirit. Having already attended to Ruth's thirst (cf. 2:9), he now attends to her hunger. He invites this young Moabite widow to join him alongside his field hands and gives her roasted grain to nourish her beyond the point of satisfaction. Moreover, he instructs his young men to aid Ruth's gleaning and alleviate her hard labor. The reapers must permit Ruth to glean among the sheaves, not just among the leftovers or at the field's edges. They must also pull out some barley from the bundles for her without demeaning or chastising her.

Boaz's generosity comes at his personal expense. His costly hospitality reflects his Scripture-informed self-understanding as this field's sojourner-steward rather than its owner.26 While Boaz takes responsibility as a man in authority, he does so in light of his more fundamental identity as a man under authority, who must

<span id="page-701-5"></span><sup>24</sup> The law (e.g., Deut. 14:21) distinguishes between a native Israelite, a "foreigner," and a "sojourner" (or "resident alien"). Sojourners enjoyed greater social inclusion in Israel than did foreigners. Although Ruth has pledged herself to Naomi's people and God even beyond Naomi's death, Ruth refers to herself as a "foreigner" to emphasize her lowly status relative to Boaz.

<span id="page-701-16"></span><span id="page-701-0"></span><sup>25</sup> Boaz embraces the divine agenda to bless the whole world through the covenant family (e.g., Gen. 12:3). The NT plainly shows Jesus' fulfillment of this agenda in passages such as Galatians 3:7–14.

<span id="page-701-4"></span><span id="page-701-3"></span><span id="page-701-2"></span><sup>26</sup> In Leviticus 25:23 the Lord affirms his ownership of Canaan and, consequently, his people's status as "sojourners" (or "resident aliens") with him there. The Lord subsequently instructs his people to extend mercy and loving kindness to impoverished fellow Israelites, particularly through obeying legislation relating to economic redemption of property and persons (Lev. 25:24–55). In other words, there is an inextricable link between acknowledging the Lord's ownership of the land and extending covenant kindness in the land after his pattern (cf. the motive clauses in Lev. 25:38, 42, 55; Deut. 10:17–19; 26:5–9).

righteously manage what the Lord entrusts to him according to covenantal priorities. Boaz understands that his privileges originate in God's unmerited favor. God's generosity always provides the foundation, power, and pattern for his people's generosity.

<span id="page-702-6"></span><span id="page-702-4"></span><span id="page-702-1"></span>2:17 Ruth gleans until evening and "beats out" (cf. Judg. 6:11) about an ephah of barley. Regardless of the precise measurement, which is somewhat debated,27 it is remarkably large (cf. Ruth 2:19 [Naomi's response]). This stunning yield from one day's work highlights Ruth's diligence and Boaz's generosity. Ruth and Boaz become the Lord's human instruments to fill Naomi. Boaz's favor certainly exceeds Ruth's expectations and, as the next verses show, Naomi's.

<span id="page-702-5"></span>2:18–22 Ruth returns to Naomi's home in the city with tangible evidence of Boaz's favor: barley and leftover food. Perhaps Naomi feared that Ruth would fail or be discouraged. On seeing the barley and food, she asks where Ruth gleaned and blesses the man who welcomed her. Ruth names Boaz as that man, which again incites Naomi to joyful blessing: "May he be blessed by the Lord, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!"28 Naomi's blessing involves several ambiguities, including whether she is praising the Lord's "kindness" or Boaz's.29 In either case, her next words confirm that light is beginning to dawn on her horizon. She adds, perhaps with a twinkle in her eye, that Boaz is a "close relative of ours, one of our redeemers." A redeemer is a close male relative who, among other things, would act on behalf of a family member in financial difficulty (cf. Introduction: Theology of Ruth; cf. also Lev. 25:23–55; Num. 27:11). The law's inclusion of such provisions for socioeconomically vulnerable persons confirms the Lord's loving kindness. Divine grace thereby precedes and motivates Boaz's loving kindness.

<span id="page-702-0"></span>Finally, Naomi reinforces Boaz's instruction to Ruth that she remain in his field. Naomi's comment stresses Ruth's precarious plight and the significance of Boaz's hospitality: If Ruth is assaulted, what man would plead her case to Bethlehem's elders? Who would advocate for her? Yet Boaz protects Ruth, including by establishing his field as an ongoing safe haven for her diligent labor.

<span id="page-702-7"></span><span id="page-702-2"></span>2:23 The concluding commentary highlights Boaz's ongoing favor and Ruth's ongoing diligence and integrity (i.e., she lodges where Naomi lodges; cf. Ruth 1:16). While the plot's setting reports a steady stream of Naomi's afflictions (1:1–5), the conclusion to this scene reports ongoing provision for her. Ruth "keeps close" (or "clings"; cf. 1:14; 2:8, 21) to the female workers in Boaz's field throughout the barley and wheat harvests and continues living with her mother-in-law. Boaz's ongoing favor to her thus stabilizes both widows. The final remark on Ruth's living

<span id="page-702-3"></span><sup>27</sup> Most estimate that an ephah is either about 6 or 10 gallons (22 or 36 l), perhaps weighing about 29 or 50 pounds (13 or 23 kg), respectively. Cf. Edward F.

arrangement points to her chastity, builds dramatic tension (since Boaz apparently has not taken initiative to marry Ruth), and sets up scene 3.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-703-1"></span>Along with proving God's loving kindness toward his people according to his promise, the book of Ruth also beckons God's people to deal kindly with one another after his pattern (cf. Deut. 10:17–19). In a world in which most are doing what is right in their own eyes, God calls and equips believers to be instruments of his blessing (cf. Gen. 12:1–3). God's kindness to his people intends to make us kind. Scene 2 develops the book's redemptive-ethical agenda in three main movements.

<span id="page-703-7"></span><span id="page-703-2"></span><span id="page-703-0"></span>First, in this broken and sinful world vulnerable outsiders are searching for kindness and standing in desperate need of favor (Ruth 2:1–3; cf. Deut. 15:11; Mark 14:7).30 In times of spiritual and moral decline, as in the days of the judges, those who suffer most profoundly are those without recourse, those who most tangibly depend on external structures for sustenance. Even in the Promised Land a sojourning widow faces untold hardship and risk.

<span id="page-703-5"></span><span id="page-703-4"></span><span id="page-703-3"></span>Second, as exemplified in the favor Ruth the Moabitess discovers with Boaz, socioeconomically vulnerable people ought to find the kindness they seek among God's covenant people (Ruth 2:4–13; cf. Heb. 13:1–2, 16; James 1:27). Indeed, vulnerable persons ought to find kindness among believers that exceeds their expectations (Ruth 2:14–17). In the days when so many were doing what was right in their own eyes, Boaz does what is right in God's eyes. Boaz is no mercy minimalist, seeking to reduce God's law to bare-minimum requirements. He gladly stewards his material and immaterial resources to advantage others (cf. comment on 2:8–13) and even welcomes Ruth as a covenant insider. Boaz understands that his blessings originate in God's unmerited favor and thus are to be used for God's glory, Boaz's enjoyment, and his neighbors' good. The extent to which Christians have grasped the enormity of God's generosity to them in Christ will be demonstrated in the extent to which they show (or fail to show) glad, humble generosity to others. Gospel-proclaiming local churches ought to astonish the world with the favor they show at-risk people, including the socioeconomically at-risk among their local church family. Tragically, many socioeconomically vulnerable people do not find the kindness they seek, not even among some such churches.

<span id="page-703-6"></span>Third, the testimony of vulnerable outsiders who find superabundant kindness among God's people provokes others to hope in God (2:18–23). Believers committed to covenant kindness encourage weary souls. The evidence of Boaz's favor that Ruth shows Naomi ushers Naomi into the early stages of revitalized hope. Bereft Naomi bursts into blessing. This scene's concluding dialogue between the two widows exhibits the provocative power of loving kindness.

Three concluding reflection questions may help stimulate gospel-empowered kindness among us. First, what do we have? Boaz views himself as a

<sup>30</sup> Here the terminology of "vulnerable outsiders" refers to those who, for various reasons, are peculiarly at risk and dependent on external structures for support (i.e., without direct access to support).

<span id="page-704-12"></span><span id="page-704-0"></span>sojourner-steward (Lev. 25:23–55; cf. Ps. 24:1) whom God has enriched partly to make him generous (cf. 2 Cor. 9:6–11). Believers must take inventory of what God has entrusted to us, whether assets material (e.g., money, house, food) or immaterial (e.g., time, energy, influence, power, socioeconomic privilege). What are the realms of our peculiar responsibility in which we might steward what God has given us for his glory and our neighbors' good? Humbly identifying our God-given resources prepares us to invest them according to God-ordained priorities.

<span id="page-704-14"></span><span id="page-704-6"></span><span id="page-704-5"></span>Second, whom do we see? Ruth goes out to glean and search for favor in someone's sight (Ruth 2:2). Thankfully, Boaz looks on her vulnerable condition with compassion. Our local churches ought to be like the field of Boaz, such that when vulnerable persons "happen" to enter our realm (v. 3), they experience being seen and are awestruck by the way Christ's servants honor them (cf. 1 Pet. 2:17). We can make progress in seeing people with eyes of love by devoting ourselves to humble listening, first to God and then to others. We could grow as listeners, for example, through prayer, Bible reading, friendships, and ministry partnerships, getting educated about relevant issues affecting people in our city, engaging in civic fora, and so on.

<span id="page-704-3"></span><span id="page-704-2"></span><span id="page-704-1"></span>Third and most fundamentally, whom do we know? Everything in the Christian life originates with knowing God (Prov. 1:7). Rightly responding to Ruth 2 entails growing constantly in our knowledge of God. Boaz's conduct is shaped by what he knows about God. New covenant Christians know even more of God's salvation purposes. While Boaz's kindness points back to God's ancient kindness in redeeming his people from Egypt and giving them the Promised Land (e.g., Deut. 4:5–8; 10:17–19; 26:1–19), it also points forward to God's future kindness in redeeming his people from their sins through Jesus Christ, the son of David (Ruth 4:17–22). God's kindness to vulnerable people comes to clearest expression in Jesus' person and work. Jesus sees our multifaceted vulnerability (e.g., Matt. 14:14–21) and takes initiative to meet our needs, even humbling himself to become God's agent of costly hospitality to defenseless sinners (Phil. 2:5–8).

<span id="page-704-13"></span><span id="page-704-11"></span><span id="page-704-10"></span><span id="page-704-9"></span><span id="page-704-8"></span><span id="page-704-7"></span><span id="page-704-4"></span>Jesus so identified with weak sinners that he impoverished himself in order to enrich us (2 Cor. 8:9). Unlike Boaz and Ruth, Jesus does not merely give us bread; he *is* our bread (John 6:35). He welcomes us at his banqueting table and nourishes us with his own body and blood, having pardoned our sin through his substitutionary sacrifice (1 Cor. 11:23–26; cf. Rev. 19:6–9). Never has the world seen more scandalous vulnerability or kindness than in Christ. Boaz is a "worthy man" (Ruth 2:1), yes. But the Lord Jesus is the worthiest of them all. There is none so noble, none so gentle, none so dignifying, none so kind. In all our vulnerability, we must keep taking refuge under his wings. Jesus will not only deal kindly with us but will also transform us as his instruments of kindness toward others. All with the resources he entrusts to us as his sojourner-stewards. All for his glory!

### <span id="page-705-1"></span>RUTH 3:1–18

3 Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you? **<sup>2</sup>** Is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. **3**Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. **<sup>4</sup>**But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what to do." **5**And she replied, "All that you say I will do."

**<sup>6</sup>** So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her motherin-law had commanded her. **7**And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. **8**At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet! **<sup>9</sup>**He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your wings*<sup>1</sup>* over your servant, for you are a redeemer." **10**And he said, "May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. **11**And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman. **12**And now it is true that I am a redeemer. Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I. **13**Remain tonight, and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good; let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then, as the Lord lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning."

**<sup>14</sup>** So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another. And he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor." **15**And he said, "Bring the garment you are wearing and hold it out." So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her. Then she went into the city. **16**And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did you fare, my daughter?" Then she told her all that the man had done for her, **<sup>17</sup>** saying, "These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said to me, 'You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.' " **<sup>18</sup>** She replied, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today."

#### *Section Overview*

<span id="page-705-0"></span>Scene 3 brings the plot to a turning point. The scene begins and ends with dialogue between Ruth and Naomi at Naomi's home in Bethlehem (3:1–5, 16–18; <span id="page-706-4"></span><span id="page-706-3"></span>cf. 2:2, 19–22) but features dialogue between Ruth and Boaz at the threshing floor (3:6–15; cf. 2:8–16). Scene 3 continues the depiction of the Lord's restoration of Naomi through the loyal love of his faithful servants Ruth and Boaz. Whereas scene 2 focuses on immediate material provisions for Naomi, scene 3 paves the way for the Lord's filling of Naomi with long-term provision through the institution of redemption. As is the case throughout the whole book, the Lord's sovereign grace operates alongside human decision and agency in spectacular congruence.

<span id="page-706-9"></span><span id="page-706-0"></span>Naomi sets up the scene by sharing her risky plan to procure Ruth's "rest" (cf. 1:8–9), that is, Ruth's enduring security in a permanent home (3:1–5). Naomi instructs her daughter-in-law to initiate a private encounter with Boaz at the threshing floor. Ruth fully complies with her mother-in-law's instructions and even proposes marriage to Boaz when he awakens (vv. 6–9). Specifically, Ruth calls Boaz to become the Lord's instrument of rewarding her covenant fidelity to Naomi (cf. 2:12) and of restoring Naomi. Boaz commends Ruth's loving kindness to Naomi and expresses his desire to honor her petition (3:10–11).

<span id="page-706-12"></span><span id="page-706-11"></span><span id="page-706-10"></span><span id="page-706-5"></span>But Boaz also discloses a complication: a nearer kinsman to Elimelech has first claim on the redemption right (vv. 12–13). Consequently, while Boaz assures Ruth that she will be redeemed the next day, he cannot guarantee by whom. When morning comes, he loads Ruth with barley and sends her back to Naomi (vv. 15–17). The scene ends with Naomi instructing her daughter-in-law to wait confidently, since Boaz will settle the redemption matter that very day (v. 18). Naomi's concluding command raises the expectations for a decisive resolution, which scene 4 relays.

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-706-8"></span><span id="page-706-7"></span><span id="page-706-6"></span><span id="page-706-2"></span><span id="page-706-1"></span>3:1–5 A number of weeks likely separate Ruth and Boaz's initial encounter (Ruth 2) and their threshing-floor encounter (Ruth 3). Ruth and Naomi arrive in Bethlehem "at the beginning of barley harvest" (1:22), and Ruth keeps gleaning in Boaz's field "until the end of the barley and wheat harvests" (2:23). The two harvests together probably involve about two months from beginning to end. Scene 3 transpires when the harvested barley brought to the threshing floor is winnowed. Winnowing barley involves tossing it into the evening breeze with a winnowing fork to separate the stalk from the chaff and straw, which the wind blows away (3:2; cf. Isa. 41:15–16).

<span id="page-707-5"></span><span id="page-707-2"></span>Whereas Ruth's plan initiates action in scene 2 (Ruth 2:2), Naomi's plan initiates this scene's events, though Ruth will play the lead role in executing that plan. Naomi first asks a rhetorical question articulating her intent to "seek rest" and good for her "daughter." Naomi aims to help bring about the very blessing she prayed for on behalf of her daughters-in-law (cf. 1:8–9). Naomi's second rhetorical question specifies the means by which she envisions the procuring of Ruth's security: through Boaz, "our relative" (not "my relative"; cf. 2:20), who has enabled Ruth to glean alongside his female workers. That Boaz is a relative means he might exercise the redemption right and buy Naomi's land (cf. comment on 2:18–22). For reasons not explained, exercising this right also entails marrying Ruth (cf. comment on 4:3–8).

<span id="page-707-9"></span><span id="page-707-7"></span><span id="page-707-6"></span>Naomi then clarifies her plan, which involves a number of risks for Ruth. Having made herself attractive to signal her marital availability,31 Ruth must brave the darkness by going stealthily down to the threshing floor and remain hidden until the opportune time. Once Boaz enjoys a good harvest-time meal and falls asleep guarding the grain, Ruth must approach him quietly, lift the blanket at his feet to expose them to the evening breeze, lie down at the place of his feet, and wait for the cold air to awaken him.32 When Boaz awakens, Ruth should follow his instructions, which Naomi expects him to give.

<span id="page-707-1"></span>Several priorities converge in Naomi's strategy. In line with her maternal role (cf. 1:8), she seeks marital security and stability for Ruth. She therefore designs a private encounter between Ruth and Boaz, hoping it will prompt Boaz to marry Ruth. Even though Naomi's plan is fraught with risk, however, it avoids moral and public disgrace. She devises, for example, for Ruth to engage Boaz in intimate, candid dialogue about marriage but without improperly touching him (only his blanket) or initiating open, public discourse with him. Because Naomi is confident in Boaz's righteous character (cf. 2:1), her plan, though decidedly risky, is neither reckless nor risqué.33

<span id="page-707-8"></span><span id="page-707-4"></span><span id="page-707-0"></span>Not all agree about how to interpret the characterization of Naomi in 3:1–4. Does Naomi's plan *negatively* illustrate maternal manipulation and ungodly pragmatism (cf. Gen. 16:1–6)? Or does Naomi's plan *positively* illustrate godly shrewdness, that is, her bold initiative showing the compatibility of faithful human initiative/agency and divine providence? The latter view seems better in the whole-book context. Naomi's plotting expresses a growing hopefulness in her outlook (cf. progression from Ruth 1:20–21 to 2:19–20 and to 3:1–4).

<span id="page-707-3"></span>Ruth complies with Naomi's instructions. While Ruth undoubtedly desires "rest" for herself, she could pursue a different man, which Boaz plainly acknowledges

<span id="page-707-10"></span><sup>31</sup> Perhaps Naomi wants Ruth to indicate the completion of her mourning for Mahlon (cf. David's changing garments and applying lotions to signal the end of his mourning in 2 Sam. 12:20). Cf. Block, *Ruth*, 169–170. 32 Cf. Hubbard, *Book of Ruth*, 203–204. Scholars debate why the narrator employs terminology that can connote sexual activity, such as "know" (i.e., sexual intercourse), "uncover" (which can be used in sexually illicit contexts), "his feet" ("feet" may in some contexts refer to genitalia), and "lie down" (i.e., sexual intercourse). Moreover, the harvest season in general and the threshing floor in particular can be associated with fertility/ fruitfulness. While the narrator may deliberately use evocative language to heighten suspense, this in no way suggests that Ruth and Boaz engage in any illicit sexual activity. The opposite is the case. In fact, scene 3 features Ruth and Boaz's commitment to righteous propriety, even in a secluded, romantically charged context. 33 Naomi knows that Boaz will not exploit Ruth. Sending Ruth to the threshing floor at night involves certain risks at the hands of other men, but not Boaz.

<span id="page-708-10"></span>(v. 10). Ruth's love for and desire to provide for her bereft mother-in-law motivates her pursuit of Boaz (cf. comment on 3:10–13). By willingly risking her own reputation and safety to propose to him, this young Moabitess continues epitomizing self-sacrificial, covenant loyalty. In meekness, she counts Naomi's interests as more significant than her own.

<span id="page-708-8"></span>3:6–7 Having verbally complied with her mother-in-law's commands, Ruth now diligently follows them. She goes down to the threshing floor and waits, shrouded in secrecy. Just as Naomi envisaged, Boaz lies down with a contented heart after enjoying his harvest.34 Ruth then comes softly to Boaz, pulls the blanket back to expose his feet to the evening breeze, and lies down (cf. comment on 3:1–5). The stage is now set for a dramatic turning point. Under the cover of darkness, Ruth awaits Boaz's awakening.

<span id="page-708-9"></span><span id="page-708-7"></span>3:8–9 Darkness, hiddenness, and seclusion obscure recognition and heighten dramatic suspense. At midnight, evening's darkest point, Boaz awakens disconcerted, presumably wincing at the cold breeze blowing over his feet. When he repositions himself, likely to adjust his blanket for warmth, he is further disconcerted by discovering "a woman" lying at his feet. He calls the woman to disclose her identity.

<span id="page-708-5"></span>Ruth takes full advantage of this critical moment of disclosure. More than merely presenting herself as eligible for marriage, she intimates that he ought to marry her. She states her name ("I am Ruth"), rank ("your servant"), request ("spread your wings [or "corners/edges," i.e., of his garment] over your servant"), and rationale ("for you are a redeemer"). Ruth is summoning Boaz to provide protection and security through marriage.35 By alluding to Boaz's prior blessing (cf. 2:12), Ruth petitions Boaz to become the Lord's human instrument of fulfilling that previous blessing. That is, having taken refuge under the Lord's "wings," Ruth now entreats Boaz to spread his "wings" over her in marriage as the Lord's agent. Undoubtedly influenced by Naomi (cf. 2:20; 3:2), Ruth appeals to the kinship principles underlying the institutions of redemption (cf. Lev. 25:24–55) and levirate marriage (cf. Deut. 25:5–10; comment on 4:3–8).

<span id="page-708-6"></span><span id="page-708-4"></span><span id="page-708-2"></span><span id="page-708-1"></span>3:10–13 Boaz recognizes Ruth's speech as a marriage proposal and responds with affectionate blessing ("my daughter"; cf. comment on 2:8–13).36 He discerns her righteous resolve to assist her mother-in-law and realizes that she is seeking marriage with him largely for her mother-in-law's sake. In Boaz's estimation, Ruth's "last kindness" (i.e., seeking to marry a redeemer for Naomi's sake) demonstrates even greater covenant loyalty to Naomi than "the first" kindness (i.e., clinging to Naomi; cf. comment on 1:14b–18). The word for "kindness" (3:10) is that rich

<span id="page-708-11"></span><span id="page-708-3"></span><span id="page-708-0"></span><sup>34</sup> The narrator portrays Boaz's eating and drinking not as excessive but simply to the point of satisfaction after having enjoyed a harvest feast. A full stomach will help him sleep, which is critical to the plan's success. 35 That Ruth is proposing marriage is supported by other passages in which this sort of language is used in the context of establishing a covenant (Ex. 19:4; Deut. 32:11), including a marriage covenant (Ezek. 16:8). The image of coming under one's "wings" connotes receiving that person's provision and protection (cf. Pss. 57:1; 61:4; Matt. 23:37). 36 See note 57.

covenantal term often translated "steadfast love" (cf. Introduction: Theology of Ruth). Consonant with Boaz's strong character, Ruth's selfless love only intensifies his admiration for her. It takes character to see character and admire it.

<span id="page-709-4"></span><span id="page-709-2"></span><span id="page-709-1"></span><span id="page-709-0"></span>After blessing and commending Ruth, Boaz responds to her specific request (v. 11). He comforts Ruth and immediately alleviates tension by promising to honor her petition (cf. 2:13). Boaz casts his decision as a response to Ruth's righteous character (cf. 2:11), about which all Bethlehem knows. Specifically, the whole town knows that Ruth is a "worthy woman" (cf. comment on 2:1). And so, while the threshing-floor setup entails Ruth's hiddenness and secrecy, once she steps into Boaz's view he praises the broad recognition of her noble character.37 Significantly, in one major Hebrew canonical tradition, the book of Ruth immediately follows Proverbs, which concludes with an acrostic portraying an archetypal worthy woman (Prov. 31:10; cf. 12:4). Whereas the book of Proverbs envisions an idealized worthy woman, the book of Ruth narrates the history of an actual worthy woman. And who is this woman who embodies covenant righteousness? An impoverished Moabite widow!

<span id="page-709-9"></span><span id="page-709-7"></span>Having assured Ruth that he will honor her request,38 Boaz reveals a complication that once again heightens suspense. In ancient Israel, a certain order among relatives dictated who might first exercise the redemption right. This sort of prescribed process somewhat resembles the contemporary practice in a last will and testament of prescribing an order among relatives for specific inheritance rights. Complicating matters for Ruth and Naomi, a nearer kinsman to Elimelech has priority in claiming the redemption right regarding Elimelech's estate (and thus in marrying Ruth as a redeemer; cf. comment on 4:3–8).39 Therefore Boaz solemnly promises Ruth that she will be redeemed, but he cannot ensure that he will be the one to do it. Boaz aims to honor Israel's laws and customs (cf. Matt. 5:17–19). In the meantime, Ruth must "remain tonight" at the threshing floor and "lie down until the morning" in the interest of safety and decorum, as darkness continues veiling her presence.

<span id="page-709-10"></span><span id="page-709-6"></span>3:14–15 Ruth follows Boaz's instructions. Although Ruth and Boaz remain together through the night, they preserve sexual chastity.40 Ruth lies at Boaz's feet until the morning and rises to leave before daylight, before anyone could "recognize" another. For propriety and protocol, Boaz stresses that their encounter must remain secret and sends Ruth home with "six measures of barley" (or "six of barley"; no specific unit of measure is stated in Hebrew). Likely he loads Ruth with barley for multiple reasons: to legitimize her visit to the threshing floor for

<span id="page-709-3"></span><sup>37</sup> Five occurrences of various forms of "know" contribute to the scene's motif of (un)recognition and disclosure (Ruth 3:3, 4, 11, 14, 18).

<span id="page-709-5"></span><sup>38</sup> The word "I" in Ruth 3:13 is emphatic, and so the verse could be rendered as the following: "But if he is not willing to redeem you, then, as the Lord lives, *I myself* will redeem you."

<sup>39</sup> This plot twist raises a number of questions. Did Naomi know about this nearer kinsman? If so, is her plan intended to circumvent the nearer kinsman as redeemer? Or is Naomi aiming to coerce the nearer kinsman into action (by involving Boaz)? Is the fact of a nearer kinsman the reason Boaz has not taken previous initiative to resolve the widows' plight? The narrator does not answer these questions.

<span id="page-709-8"></span><sup>40</sup> The narrator portrays the consummation of Boaz and Ruth's marriage in Ruth 4:13 as their initial sexual union.

<span id="page-710-7"></span>townspeople she encounters on the journey home, to provide food for the widows (cf. esp. 3:17), and to signify his solemn intent to honor his oath. The barley partly functions as a guarantee, a down payment of coming redemption.

<span id="page-710-6"></span><span id="page-710-5"></span>3:16–18 Naomi awaits Ruth's return, undoubtedly gripped by curiosity. When barley-laden Ruth arrives home, Naomi inquires, "Who are you, my daughter?" (AT; cf. 3:9) or "How did you fare, my daughter?" (ESV). Perhaps Naomi hardly recognizes her daughter-in-law, wrapped in a garment full of barley. Ruth gives the full report (cf. 2:18–21), including Boaz's concern that she not return to her mother-in-law "empty-handed" (cf. 1:21; cf. also Deut. 15:13).

<span id="page-710-2"></span><span id="page-710-0"></span>Naomi seems to perceive Boaz's explanation as heralding the imminent resolution of her emptiness. She instructs Ruth to sit until discovering how the redemption issue is resolved. Ruth can be patient, insists Naomi, because Boaz will not "rest" until he sees the issue to its completion.41 Here again Naomi discloses her confidence in Boaz's worthy character. Thematic symmetry is created, as the scene begins with Naomi's instruction for Ruth to take bold initiative and concludes with Naomi's instruction for Ruth to wait with bold hope.

#### *Response*

<span id="page-710-8"></span>At the outset of this chapter, no positive outcome is guaranteed for Naomi or Ruth. Similarly, life in this broken and sinful world unfolds amid many unknowns, some involving breathtaking suspense. Sometimes even the best laid plans do not materialize (Prov. 19:21). In such a context, we believers face a panoply of tests, including the temptation to relate to people according to our own self-interest. But amid life's twists and turns we must continue entrusting ourselves to God's sovereign care and choose to lead lives marked by love. Such righteous resolve suffuses scene 3. Indeed, against a backdrop of darkness and suspense, bold acts of love shine, including in the following three ways.

<span id="page-710-4"></span><span id="page-710-1"></span>First, rather than mainly seeking to advance their own interests, Naomi and Ruth seek to advance one another's (Ruth 3:1–9). While both widows would benefit from a marriage between Ruth and Boaz, neither widow prioritizes her own welfare. Each takes righteous initiative for the other's sake, which in Ruth's case involves meaningful personal risk. But despite Ruth's precarious situation, she displays the same character in broad daylight (ch. 1–2) as in the secrecy of night (ch. 3). She even courageously calls Boaz to embody self-sacrificial love when she proposes marriage to him. In doing so she avails herself of God's gracious provision in the law's institutions of redemption and levirate marriage. Likewise, amid intrigue and dicey circumstances we believers must rely on the Lord Jesus to help us persevere in self-sacrificial love by his grace and after his pattern (John 13:1; 1 Pet. 2:21–25).

<span id="page-710-9"></span>Second, rather than shirking responsibility toward Ruth and Naomi or usurping the nearer kinsman's responsibility, Boaz embraces these two widows' cause

<span id="page-710-3"></span><sup>41</sup> The word translated "rest" in Ruth 3:18 differs from that in 3:1. Whereas the "rest" in 3:1 refers to Ruth's enduring security in a home, the "rest" in 3:18 refers to Boaz's refusal to be quiet or still until he fulfills his promise. This latter term could also be translated "cease."

<span id="page-711-0"></span>in a manner that honors every interested party (Ruth 3:10–13). He acts neither self-protectively (i.e., by absolving himself of all responsibility because of the nearer kinsman) nor autonomously (i.e., by contravening Israel's laws or customs to claim rights that are not his). Rather than seeking to avoid discomfort or exalt himself, Boaz seeks to comfort Ruth and exalt her ultimate benefactor, the Lord. With tender-hearted affection Boaz articulates his admiration for Ruth and assures her that he will support her according to proper protocol. He exhibits the sort of wise gentleness that comes to its fullest expression in the Lord Jesus Christ, who refuses to break a bruised reed or snuff out a smoldering wick until he accomplishes justice (Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20).

<span id="page-711-4"></span><span id="page-711-1"></span>Third, Boaz seals his oath of loving kindness to Ruth and Naomi with a guarantee, the barley gift, to assure them of his sincerity (Ruth 3:14–18). He seems to recognize that in the widows' circumstance they might be tempted to indulge unwarranted skepticism, perhaps out of self-defensive fear. Boaz thus encourages them with a barley gift, partly to confirm his word's trustworthiness. Boaz's proven character and demonstrable love inspire Naomi (and Ruth) to wait confidently and patiently. So, in the aftermath of this scene's climactic action, the widows await the fulfillment of Boaz's promise.

<span id="page-711-8"></span>In certain respects the widows' situation as scene 3 ends resembles believers' situation here and now, in the aftermath of the biblical storyline's climactic (but not culminating) action. That is, on account of the life, death, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ, believers presently enjoy salvation's firstfruits but must await salvation's full outworking (1 John 3:1–3). We live in the already and not yet and look to the Lord's second coming, when God will resolve all remaining tension and consummate his every promise. In the meantime, our redeemer encourages us by giving us a pledge. Boaz graciously guarantees his oath with six measures of barley, but the Lord Jesus guarantees his oath by giving us the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 1:20–22). God's gift of the Spirit demonstrates his trustworthiness and serves as the down payment of our inheritance until we obtain full possession of it (Eph. 1:13–14).

<span id="page-711-7"></span><span id="page-711-6"></span><span id="page-711-5"></span><span id="page-711-3"></span><span id="page-711-2"></span>Moreover, Jesus grants his church the sacraments as tangible seals of his grace (cf. Rom. 4:11). These demonstrable confirmations of Christ's loving kindness strengthen us amid life's murky ambiguities to keep entrusting ourselves to God's sovereign care and choose to lead lives of love. We can take him at his word and wait for the morning, when he will resolve all complications (Ruth 3:18; cf. Ps. 37:7). As the saying attributed to Corrie ten Boom urges, "Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God."

### <span id="page-712-0"></span>RUTH 4:1–22

4 Now Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the redeemer, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. So Boaz said, "Turn aside, friend; sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down. **2**And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down. **3**Then he said to the redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. **<sup>4</sup>** So I thought I would tell you of it and say, 'Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you*<sup>1</sup>* will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you." And he said, "I will redeem it." **5**Then Boaz said, "The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth*<sup>2</sup>* the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance." **6**Then the redeemer said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it."

**7**Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel. **<sup>8</sup>** So when the redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself," he drew off his sandal. **<sup>9</sup>**Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon. **10**Also Ruth the Moabite, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day." **11**Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, "We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem, **<sup>12</sup>** and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the Lord will give you by this young woman."

**<sup>13</sup>** So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son. **14**Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel! **15**He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughterin-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him." **16**Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse. **17**And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.

**<sup>18</sup>**Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron, **19**Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab, **20**Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon, **<sup>21</sup>** Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed, **22**Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.

Three interrelated resolutions bring the book to completion. First, Boaz resolves the legal matter of redemption (4:1–12), which, second, precipitates the whole plot's resolution (vv. 13–17). The plot resolution contributes, third, to resolving a key tension characterizing the redemptive-historical era in which Israel has no king (vv. 18–22; cf. 1:1). The narrator progressively accelerates the narrative tempo and expands the narrative horizon across these three literary units, from action occurring one day at Bethlehem's gate (4:1–12), to action in one Bethlehemite household unfolding across more than nine months (vv. 13–17), and then to action spanning hundreds of years that affects the whole covenant family (vv. 18–22).

<span id="page-713-6"></span><span id="page-713-4"></span>Scene 4 (4:1–12) narrates the legal proceedings that resolve the redemption matter (cf. 3:12–13). Boaz convenes a formal meeting involving the kinsmanredeemer (i.e., Elimelech's nearest male relative) and ten elders (4:1–2). The kinsman-redeemer initially claims the redemption right, but once Boaz clarifies that the transaction includes marrying "Ruth the Moabite" and seeking to perpetuate the name of the deceased, the kinsman-redeemer transfers his right to Boaz (vv. 3–8). Boaz then redeems Elimelech's land and legacy before witnesses (vv. 9–10), who call on the Lord to bless Ruth and Boaz along the lines of the Lord's historic grace to Israel and Judah (vv. 11–12).

<span id="page-713-10"></span><span id="page-713-9"></span><span id="page-713-8"></span><span id="page-713-3"></span>The plot resolution (vv. 13–17) establishes the outcome and significance of Boaz's redemptive act. It features the resolution of the plot's central conflict, namely, Naomi's emptiness and assumption of divine disfavor. The Bethlehemite women, who previously heard Naomi's complaint about the Lord (cf. 1:19–21), praise the Lord's grace in providing a redeemer for Naomi (4:14–15). The narrator then surprises first-time readers and listeners by informing them that Obed is King David's grandfather (v. 17).

<span id="page-713-14"></span><span id="page-713-13"></span><span id="page-713-12"></span><span id="page-713-2"></span>This ancestry establishes the high stakes of the book's dramatic action and unveils the Lord's sovereign grace. The narrator frames the book with the report of Naomi's devastating decade (1:1–5) and the report of ten generations of the royal lineage (4:18–22). This narrative frame confirms that even when the covenant family seems to be spinning out of control in moral and spiritual anarchy (cf. Judg. 21:25), the Lord is advancing his salvation purposes. The book's culminating focus thereby falls on the Lord's loving kindness toward his suffering people, to whom he mercifully and providentially grants rest through his anointed one (cf. 2 Samuel 7).

#### *Comment*

<span id="page-714-5"></span><span id="page-714-4"></span><span id="page-714-3"></span><span id="page-714-2"></span>4:1–2 Scene 4 (4:1–12) features Boaz's righteous resolve. Specifically, it recounts his acquisition of the redemption right, with some form of "redeem" occurring twelve times (vv. 1, 3, 4 [5x], 6 [4x], 8). The first two verses set up the action by describing Boaz's initiative to honor his promise to Ruth (cf. 3:13) in a manner that also honors Israel's laws and customs. References to "the gate" and "the elders" enclose the unit (4:1–2, 11), which underscores the lawfulness of the proceedings, since legal matters in ancient Israel were often settled by elders at the gate.42 Probably Boaz sits down at Bethlehem's gate to signal his intention to convene a formal assembly. When the kinsman-redeemer (i.e., Elimelech's nearest male relative) providentially passes by, Boaz bids him to sit as well.43 Boaz then calls ten elders to sit, likely to establish a quorum.

<span id="page-714-6"></span><span id="page-714-0"></span>4:3–8 Boaz's dialogue with the kinsman-redeemer exhibits Boaz's integrity. He informs the kinsman-redeemer of Naomi's intention to sell Elimelech's plot of land and calls the kinsman-redeemer to claim or cede his redemption right to Boaz, who is next in line (cf. Lev. 25:23–28). As the focus of the conversation between Ruth and Boaz was about marriage, Boaz's leading with the issue of Elimelech's property is, at first glance, surprising for modern audiences.

That Boaz casts the transaction in terms of redemption implies that Naomi is selling the right to the land's yield for a limited period of time, providing shortterm income but no long-term means of support (cf. Lev. 25:23–28).44 Yet the issue

<span id="page-714-1"></span><sup>42</sup> In premonarchical Israel elders play a major role in judicial, legal, and commercial matters and often settled cases at the town gate (Deut. 21:19; 22:15; 25:7; Josh. 20:4).

<span id="page-714-7"></span><sup>43</sup> The narrator refrains from naming the kinsman-redeemer and instead has Boaz refer to him as "friend" (or "a certain one," "so and so"). Cf. comment on 4:3–8; Bush, *Ruth-Esther*, 232–233.

<sup>44</sup> Although land in Israel could not be sold permanently or outside the clan, the land's *use*/*yield* could be sold temporarily to alleviate a landowner's poverty. The impoverished landowner's nearest kinsman retained the

<span id="page-715-4"></span>of Naomi's sale involves numerous ambiguities that have inspired much debate.45 For example, if widowed Naomi possesses the legal right to Elimelech's land, how has she obtained that right,46 and why has Ruth been gleaning elsewhere (cf. 2:2)? Perhaps before departing for Moab Elimelech sold the right to his land's yield for a specified amount of time, and now at harvest's end Naomi is selling her right to redeem the entitlement to the land's yield from whomever purchased that entitlement from Elimelech.

<span id="page-715-6"></span>The kinsman-redeemer initially agrees to redeem Elimelech's estate, which heightens the dramatic suspense. Boaz then clarifies that redeeming Elimelech's property will entail redeeming his legacy. That is, the redeemer must "acquire" through marriage Mahlon's widow, "Ruth the Moabite," for the purpose of begetting an heir to "perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance."47 The commercial language in verse 5 applied to Ruth ("acquire"; "bought," v. 10) is used in light of this marriage's association with a commercial transaction involving property.48 Biblical redemption legislation nowhere instructs a redeemer to marry a deceased relative's widow. Boaz seems to be applying kinship principles operative in levirate marriage that aim to preserve the family line of a deceased male relative (cf. Deut. 25:5–10).49 Perhaps he is following extrabiblical customs rooted in levirate-marriage principles about which Naomi and Ruth know (cf. Ruth 3:9), or else he is innovatively going beyond the law's letter to apply its spirit along the lines of Ruth's proposal (cf. comments on 2:4–17).50 Regardless, Boaz's speech exhibits his resolve to embody righteousness, no matter the cost.

<span id="page-715-7"></span><span id="page-715-5"></span><span id="page-715-3"></span><span id="page-715-2"></span>Just as Orpah's ordinary decision to return to her maternal home comparatively highlights Ruth's extraordinary loving kindness to cling to Naomi (1:14), the kinsman-redeemer's ordinary pragmatism comparatively highlights Boaz's extraordinary righteousness. The kinsman-redeemer claims the redemption right only when, to his knowledge, the transaction is limited to Elimelech's property. Presumably he calculates the transaction's potential benefit to his own inheritance and its relatively minor cost. (The cost would involve taking responsibility for

<span id="page-715-0"></span>right to redeem (buy back) that entitlement to the land's yield. Moreover, all sales of the land's yield remained temporary, enduring only "until the year of jubilee" (Lev. 25:28), at which point the property would return to the rightful heir.

<sup>45</sup> For a discussion of various views regarding Naomi's sale cf. Bush, *Ruth-Esther*, 200–204, 211–215.

<span id="page-715-1"></span><sup>46</sup> Biblical law stipulates a prescribed inheritance order if a man dies without sons (Num. 27:1–11) but nowhere explicitly enables a widow to inherit her deceased husband's property. Perhaps Naomi maintained the right of the land's yield until she remarried or died, at which point the inheritance allotment would pass to the nearest male relative in Elimelech's clan (in the absence of Elimelech's brothers or paternal uncles).

<span id="page-715-8"></span><sup>47</sup> There are two points of debate on the interpretation of 4:5. Most follow the ESV in emending "*I* must acquire *from Ruth*" to "*you* must acquire *Ruth*." The first is supported by the Hebrew reading tradition and several ancient versions, and the second is supported by the Vulgate; both involve only minor changes to make better contextual sense.

<sup>48</sup> Cf. Campbell, *Ruth*, 147. Campbell writes, "Where the transfer of Ruth is designated [by the term 'buy'], the meaning is not strictly 'purchase' or 'gain by payment'; rather it can be paraphrased 'marry as part of a legally valid commercial transaction.'"

<sup>49</sup> Elimelech's lineage is in view even if "the dead" refers to his son Mahlon, since Mahlon would naturally carry on Elimelech's name.

<sup>50</sup> Even if Boaz is innovatively going beyond Israel's traditions in associating the redemption of Elimelech's property with marrying Ruth, which is not certain, Boaz's actions put pressure on the kinsman-redeemer. Now that Boaz has openly associated the two "acquisitions," were the kinsman-redeemer to claim only the redemption right regarding property and not Ruth, the kinsman-redeemer would run the risk of losing favor in the witnesses' sight.

<span id="page-716-4"></span>Naomi's welfare.) But the cost-benefit ratio changes with the addition of marrying "Ruth the Moabite" to produce an heir for Elimelech. Without a male heir, the property would have passed to this kinsman (cf. Num. 27:1–11). But as soon as a male heir would be born, it would pass back to that child, which means this man would have used his resources to support two widows, with no long-term financial gain to himself.51 And so, concerned with preserving his own estate and not that of his kinsman Elimelech, the kinsman-redeemer cedes his redemption right. Perhaps this redeemer's namelessness ironically reflects his self-interested refusal to perpetuate his deceased relative's name.52

<span id="page-716-10"></span>After the kinsman-redeemer verbally transfers the redemption right to Boaz (v. 6), he does so ceremonially (vv. 7–8).53 The narrator's explanation of the ancient ritual performed in the presence of witnesses emphasizes the lawfulness of Boaz's acquisition. Boaz dutifully follows every proper procedure and custom in order to become the authorized redeemer.

<span id="page-716-11"></span><span id="page-716-9"></span>4:9–12 Boaz's speech to the witnesses and their response bring to the fore the covenantal character of Boaz's redemptive act. Boaz first calls the elders and bystanders to confirm the transfer of the redemption right. In the process he reiterates his covenantal interest in marrying "Ruth the Moabite" (cf. v. 5), namely, to perpetuate Elimelech's name and keep it from being "cut off" (cf. 1 Sam. 24:21 [David's promise to Saul]).54 Boaz thereby epitomizes covenant loyalty.

<span id="page-716-12"></span><span id="page-716-1"></span>The elders and bystanders ratify the redemption and invoke the Lord's blessing on Ruth and Boaz by asking the Lord to show the same benevolence to Boaz and Ruth that he has to his servants in the past.55 First, the group agrees to serve as formal witnesses. Second, they petition the Lord to cause Ruth to be fruitful in building up Boaz's house, "like Rachel and Leah" were fruitful in building up Israel's "house" (i.e., lineage; cf. Gen. 29:31–30:24).56 The witnesses clearly view Ruth as a legitimate marriage partner for Boaz. Third, they express their desire for Boaz to "act worthily" (cf. Ruth 2:1; 3:11) and "be renowned" among his native clan in his native town. Their desire for Boaz's renown evokes his concern to keep Elimelech's name from being cut off in his "native place." Boaz's ultimate renown probably exceeds the witnesses' expectations, as he becomes the great-grandfather of King David. Finally, the witness-chorus asks the Lord to give Boaz offspring

55 Cf. note 9.

<span id="page-716-8"></span><sup>51</sup> Cf. Bush, *Ruth-Esther*, 232–233.

<span id="page-716-3"></span><span id="page-716-2"></span><sup>52</sup> Cf. note 43. Biblical narrators sometimes refrain from naming a character for a thematic reason. Here is a classic ironic example: while the narrator does not record the name of Pharaoh (Ex. 1:8), whom the world would deem highly significant, the narrator does record the names of the Hebrew midwives (Ex. 1:15), whom the world might deem less significant but whose risk-taking faithfulness secures their honor and renown among God's people. For discussion of the kinsman-redeemer's namelessness cf. Bush, *Ruth-Esther*, 196–197. 53 The significance of removing one's sandal to indicate the transfer remains unclear. The customs pertaining to levirate marriage also involve removing a sandal (cf. Deut. 25:5–10), but the presenting issue and symbol's intent in Deuteronomy 25 sufficiently differs from that of Ruth 4 and so does not help to explain the meaning of the custom in Ruth 4. Commentators even debate the subject of the clause "he drew off his sandal"—is it Elimelech or the kinsman-redeemer? Most lean toward the kinsman-redeemer as the sandal remover, so that the sandal functions as proof of purchase for the acquirer. Cf. discussion in Campbell, *Ruth*, 148.

<span id="page-716-7"></span><span id="page-716-6"></span><span id="page-716-5"></span><sup>54</sup> Cf. note 48. The word "bought" in 4:10 is the same as "acquire" in 4:5; cf. comment on 4:3–8.

<span id="page-716-0"></span><sup>56</sup> Both Rachel and Leah experienced barrenness at various points in life, and the Lord sovereignly enabled them to conceive and bear children (Gen. 29:31, 35; 30:1, 9, 22).

through Ruth so that his "house" would be built in the pattern of the house of Perez, Tamar's son through her father-in-law, Judah.57 On the whole, the witnesses' benediction exhibits the power of covenant kindness to inspire joyful hope among God's people.

<span id="page-717-14"></span>4:13–17 The narrator transitions to show the outcome and significance of Boaz's and Ruth's loving kindness. The immediate outcome is summarized: Boaz marries Ruth and consummates the marriage, and the Lord "gives [Ruth] conception" so that she bears a son (cf. Gen. 29:31). The Lord's generosity in this conception is highlighted without any comment on Ruth's previous childlessness with Mahlon.

<span id="page-717-13"></span><span id="page-717-10"></span><span id="page-717-0"></span>The Bethlehemite women play the major role in illuminating this baby's significance. They celebrate the Lord's restoration of Naomi, which heightens the sense of dramatic resolution due to their role in scene 1 (cf. 1:19–21). They bless the Lord for not leaving Naomi "without a redeemer,"58 whose name they desire to be renowned in Israel (cf. 4:11). This baby is a "redeemer" in that he preserves Elimelech's family line and, as the women elatedly envision, returns life to Naomi and will provide for her.59 They know he will care for Naomi in her old age because his mother is Ruth, "who loves [Naomi], who is more to [Naomi] than seven sons" (a number signifying completion; e.g., Josh. 6:4).60 The narrator then shares a touching moment: Naomi, bereft of her own "sons" (Ruth 1:5), now embraces the "child" in her lap (4:16).61 Finally, the women name the child and sum up his value to Naomi: "A son has been born to Naomi."

<span id="page-717-16"></span><span id="page-717-9"></span><span id="page-717-5"></span>The narrator punctuates the drama by disclosing a final (shocking) piece of information about this child's identity: he is "Obed . . . the father of Jesse, the father of David." By waiting until the conclusion to reveal Naomi's connection to King David, the narrator spotlights the Lord's hidden and blessed providence at work throughout her circumstances. Humanly speaking, without the famine in Bethlehem precipitating Elimelech's family's sojourn in Moab, without Mahlon's marriage to Ruth and subsequent death, without Ruth's clinging to Naomi, without Ruth's "happening" (2:3) upon Boaz's field—and so on—there would be no King David, nor the rest for the nation that the Lord ultimately grants through him (cf. Deut. 12:10; 2 Sam. 7:1, 11). The book of Ruth underscores the Lord's supernatural grace at work even generations before David's birth to raise up his servant David by way of his dealing kindly with his servant Naomi, who would have died before learning that the Lord had incorporated her into the royal lineage.

<span id="page-717-12"></span><span id="page-717-6"></span><span id="page-717-4"></span><span id="page-717-1"></span><sup>57</sup> Similar to the places named in Ruth 1:2, the witnesses mention Ephrathah, Bethlehem, and Judah, although here "Judah" refers to the man rather than the ancestral territory. Judah had refused to apply the levirate provision for Tamar's advantage following the deaths of Tamar's husbands, his sons (Genesis 38; cf. Matt. 1:3). But whereas Judah failed to deal righteously with widowed Tamar (Gen. 38:26), Boaz succeeds in dealing righteously with widowed Ruth and Naomi.

<span id="page-717-15"></span><span id="page-717-8"></span><span id="page-717-2"></span><sup>58</sup> Although in the original language the specific word for "left . . . without" in Ruth 4:14 differs from that in 1:3, 5, the conceptual overlap contributes to the tone of dramatic resolution.

<span id="page-717-3"></span><sup>59</sup> Joseph uses "provide" (or "nourish") to describe his commitment to sustain his brothers and family in Egypt (Gen. 45:11; 47:12; 50:21).

<span id="page-717-11"></span><sup>60</sup> The women's evaluation of Ruth underscores the inaccuracy of Naomi's self-evaluation in scene 1. Although Naomi declared herself "empty" (1:21) on arrival in Bethlehem, she had returned with Ruth, whose covenant loyalty would keep proving to be of surpassing worth.

<span id="page-717-7"></span><sup>61</sup> The Hebrew word is the same in each instance. Cf. comment on 1:2–5.

The book's surprise ending thereby calls the covenant family to trust the Lord's loving kindness, even if they cannot perceive his providence or know how he will accomplish his salvation purposes during their days on earth.

<span id="page-718-14"></span><span id="page-718-4"></span>4:18–22 The narrator concludes the book with a ten-generation genealogy from Perez to David. This selective genealogy (cf. 1 Chron. 2:4–15) symbolizes the renewal of Elimelech's decimated line (Ruth 1:1–5) and highlights Boaz and David, placing them in the seventh and tenth positions, respectively.62 Moreover, the genealogy brings into view the plot's embeddedness in the larger biblical storyline by stressing the long-range import of the Lord's grace to Naomi. In the Lord's providence the impact of Ruth's and Boaz's loving kindness stretches well beyond Naomi's field of vision to help secure rest for all Israel.

<span id="page-718-17"></span><span id="page-718-16"></span>Indeed, the impact stretches well beyond even the human narrator's field of vision. The prophet Micah announces the day, after the nation's experience of exile, in which a ruler coming from "Bethlehem Ephrathah" would "stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord" and secure lasting peace for the Lord's people (Mic. 5:2–5). As the Gospel writer Matthew makes plain, this anticipated ruler from Bethlehem is the Lord Jesus Christ, David's greater son (Matt. 1:1–17; 2:5–6; cf. Rev. 5:5). In Christ the lineage of Ruth 4:18–22 finds its ultimate fulfillment. No matter how hopelessly cyclical human history may seem in the days when the judges judge (1:1), the Lord is advancing his salvation purposes to raise up his anointed servant, a king (v. 22), on behalf of all those who take refuge under his wings (2:12).

#### <span id="page-718-13"></span><span id="page-718-5"></span><span id="page-718-3"></span>*Response*

<span id="page-718-8"></span><span id="page-718-2"></span>The book of Ruth contributes to Scripture's redemption theme by furnishing a concrete, specific embodiment of the institution. Ruth 1–3 establishes that redemption is needed for the resolution of two widows' precarious plights. Ruth 4 then displays the peculiar effectiveness of the redemption institution to defend the defenseless. The chapter illustrates redemption's cost (vv. 1–8), covenantal character (vv. 9–12), consequence (vv. 13–17), and course (vv. 18–22).

<span id="page-718-9"></span><span id="page-718-7"></span><span id="page-718-6"></span>The speech and action in Ruth 4:1–8 point to redemption's cost. Boaz's exchange with the kinsman-redeemer, for example, establishes that redeeming Elimelech's land and legacy entails decided personal risk on the redeemer's part. Boaz chooses to absorb that risk and extend costly, self-sacrificial loving kindness in order to advance the cause of the defenseless, namely, two widows and the deceased (who cannot perpetuate their own name). In this way Boaz imitates the Lord, who "purchased" his people to deliver and bless them (Ex. 15:16; cf. Gal. 3:13–14).63

<span id="page-718-11"></span><span id="page-718-10"></span><span id="page-718-0"></span>Ruth 4:9–12 emphasizes redemption's distinctly covenantal character. On acquiring the redemption right, Boaz reiterates (cf. 4:5) his chief concern, which is

<span id="page-718-12"></span><sup>62</sup> The genealogy honors Boaz (7th position) and celebrates David (10th and final position). Boaz's *seventh* position functions symbolically in a manner similar to the description of Ruth's love for Naomi as surpassing the value of *seven* sons (4:15). That is, both Boaz and Ruth exemplify wholehearted, exemplary righteousness, which the number seven symbolizes.

<span id="page-718-15"></span><span id="page-718-1"></span><sup>63</sup> The Hebrew word in Exodus 15:16 is the same as that for "acquire" and "bought" in Ruth 4:5, 10, and, when describing the Lord's rescue of his people, it is parallel elsewhere to the word "redeem" (Ps. 74:2).

thoroughly covenantal: he aims to perpetuate the name of his deceased kinsmen so as to prevent that name from being cut off. The witnesses respond to Boaz's loving kindness in a manner that highlights the nation's heritage and rootedness in the Lord's sovereign grace (vv. 9–12). The witnesses implore the Lord to work miraculously in and through Ruth and Boaz along those same historic lines.

<span id="page-719-7"></span><span id="page-719-6"></span>Ruth 4:13–17 specifies the immediate and long-range consequence (i.e., outcome and significance) of Boaz's and Ruth's loving kindness. Most immediately, Boaz's redemptive act involves marriage to Ruth and leads to their son's birth. The Bethlehemite women celebrate this son's import for widowed Naomi by referring to him as Naomi's "redeemer." They exult in the Lord's restorative grace to comfort Naomi through Obed, whose birth helps demonstrate that the Lord is not against Naomi (cf. 1:13, 20–21) but for her. Additionally, the narrator discloses the fartherreaching consequence of Boaz's and Ruth's covenant kindness: Naomi's grandson Obed is King David's grandfather. On the whole, the plot's resolution implies that even if God's people do not know precisely *how* he will work all things together for their good, they must trust *that* he will (cf. Rom. 8:28).

<span id="page-719-13"></span><span id="page-719-8"></span><span id="page-719-4"></span><span id="page-719-2"></span>The book's concluding ten-generation genealogy in Ruth 4:18–22 shows redemption's course. The unfolding action instigated by Boaz's redemptive act culminates in the coming of David, Israel's anointed king. Redemption's course culminates in a crown. In this way, the narrator establishes that the resolution of Naomi's predicament is tied to the resolution of the whole nation's predicament in lacking a human king (1:1; cf. Judg. 21:25). The epilogue thereby stresses that the Lord uses even his people's hardships and experiences of deprivation (e.g., the sojourn of Elimelech's family due to famine) to advance his ultimate salvation purposes. That is, as David himself calls the cosmos to declare, "The Lord reigns!" (1 Chron. 16:31; cf. Ex. 15:18; 1 Sam. 12:12).

The Lord Jesus redeems believers from sin and death, "not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with [his] precious blood" (1 Pet. 1:18–19). Because of his costly, self-sacrificial ransom (cf. Gal. 3:13), we who are united to him by faith shall never be cut off. He grants us "the Spirit of adoption as sons" (Rom. 8:15) and thereby incorporates us into his covenant family, providing us incomparable security as "heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ" (Rom. 8:17). When Jesus returns to redeem our bodies and consummate his kingdom (Rom. 8:23), we shall behold the full outcome of our Father's eternal purposes in his Son. All we who trust in him shall "see his face, and his name will be on [our] foreheads" (Rev. 22:4). So, no matter the sorrows we carry and the losses we believers incur (e.g., Ruth 1:1–5) until the day when God wipes every tear from our eyes, we can trust that in Christ God is for us (Rom. 8:31) and is even using our trials to advance our ultimate good and his greater glory (e.g., Gen. 50:20; James 1:2–4). On him our King we have set our hope and in him find our rest (Matt. 11:28–12:14; Heb. 4:9–10).
