    "format": "meaning"
  },
  {
    "chunk_id": "Col 1:1‑14 / Opening Greeting / a) The Apostle Paul",
    "question": "How does the structure of Col 1:9‑12 reveal the purpose behind Paul’s prayer?",
    "answer": "Paul first prays that the Colossians be filled with the knowledge of God’s will; each following clause (walk worthily, bear fruit, grow in knowledge, give thanks) depends on that request, making the prayer tightly logical.",
    "format": "structure"
  },
  {
    "chunk_id": "Col 1:1‑14 / Opening Greeting / a) The Apostle Paul",
    "question": "What implication for Christian identity arises from the transfer described in Col 1:13‑14?",
